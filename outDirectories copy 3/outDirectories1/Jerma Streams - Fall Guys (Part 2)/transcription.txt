[2.36s -> 8.44s]  Let me just change the category and uh oh I need my controller.
[8.44s -> 11.08s]  You guys play this game with a controller or do you play it with a keyboard mouse?
[11.72s -> 25.45s]  How the hell would you play this with keyboard and mouse? I think that'd be really really hard to do.
[31.18s -> 35.86s]  Okay you can't see anything yet you will very soon.
[37.22s -> 56.55s]  Here we are okay so what's the oh this I've already turned the music off.
[57.19s -> 72.04s]  We keep the music off. We'll keep it on. Let me just change the title and we can go.
[72.76s -> 79.34s]  Uh the title's uh gonna get out of prison today um whatever I don't care.
[79.34s -> 92.95s]  That's fine. This bit's I mean a little bit.
[93.91s -> 104.81s]  I'm app I'm definitely not gonna come even close by the way to winning a single match.
[105.53s -> 118.04s]  There's a lot of colors in this game and change it to finally out of prison.
[129.27s -> 132.71s]  Keep making jokes like you're actually getting out of prison today.
[132.71s -> 137.11s]  Like wait why are they letting me I've just I'm streaming Fall Guys from prison?
[138.07s -> 153.90s]  Yes I mean you guys already all know that that's bullshit.
[154.86s -> 160.63s]  It would be a thing that we do to to the one person that ends up coming and I I'm gonna lose.
[162.79s -> 175.06s]  Maybe not. Maybe not. There's always somebody worse than you and there's always somebody better than you.
[175.06s -> 177.46s]  Remember that. It's a very important thing to remember in life.
[183.93s -> 197.42s]  He's a sage. Sage. I'm a sage. That's pretty sage-like.
[198.06s -> 209.46s]  If he wins he goes free. What like everyone all the other inmates are playing right now.
[209.46s -> 214.09s]  Whoever wins this gets the get out of jail free card.
[214.09s -> 227.14s]  That's really messed up. It's already a series.
[228.23s -> 231.22s]  Dead Man Wonderland. Is that like a show?
[241.29s -> 243.21s]  All right I hate the egg one. The egg one's always too hard.
[246.09s -> 255.98s]  Sorry. You just don't want to come in last and I'm gonna get that gold medal.
[256.86s -> 258.33s]  I'll get it. Yeah.
[258.73s -> 273.14s]  Stop. Leave me alone. We only have 11 in here.
[280.65s -> 284.65s]  Now this is not even that interesting to me because you just see this shit on Easter every
[284.65s -> 291.19s]  year anyways. A bunch of little kids just fucking going nuts looking for the hidden eggs.
[299.59s -> 303.59s]  Holy shit. You guys ever do that thing or you guys have your parents do that thing or somebody
[304.15s -> 307.11s]  it always caused a huge problem for some reason. It just did.
[308.95s -> 312.95s]  All the little hidden eggs for Easter. Yeah we're gonna do the egg hunt.
[313.67s -> 317.51s]  And for some reason like one of the participants somebody that came over that day or somebody
[317.51s -> 321.35s]  that was there or an aunt or an uncle or a friend of the family doesn't matter
[322.55s -> 327.27s]  put like the like a 20 dollar bill or like a 50 dollar bill in one of them.
[328.15s -> 335.27s]  Like a 10 dollar bill would be in one of them and it's like dude like don't you come on like
[335.35s -> 341.51s]  whoever gets that's gonna get like 50 bucks. These are like six-year-olds they don't even
[341.51s -> 348.81s]  know what money is. Don't don't do that. Put like a lot of pieces in there man. Oh don't
[349.53s -> 352.01s]  don't put like a 20 dollar bill in there you're gonna start fighting.
[355.21s -> 360.89s]  And then everyone just says well you know we'll just use uh we'll just use that for something.
[362.33s -> 364.57s]  Like the kid doesn't even get the money like his parents do.
[364.57s -> 378.17s]  Oh wow yeah little little little John got a 50 dollar bill in there. Oh good for you sport.
[379.05s -> 384.78s]  Mommy will hold on to that one. But the parents you just go out to like a nice dinner with you
[384.78s -> 406.06s]  and like your husband. What somebody said what's wrong with your family. I saw at least a handful
[406.06s -> 414.07s]  of people say that that was something they remembered. You can't just do any amount of
[414.07s -> 418.31s]  money is bad because you put a dollar in there even a seven-year-old knows. Oh that's fucking
[418.31s -> 423.43s]  nothing dude. Like even when you're like eight nine years old it's like oh this one's got money
[423.43s -> 431.77s]  in it. It's two dollars. Oh this is not this is nothing. A dollar. Why is this even in the egg?
[435.75s -> 438.79s]  And then like you go you look over like your uncle's like smoking a fucking cigarette like
[438.79s -> 446.36s]  in the corner like yeah you don't spend it all in one place. It's obviously like it was a way
[446.36s -> 449.24s]  that like he was making a joke with like one of the other uncles or aunts or something.
[449.72s -> 463.46s]  I'm winning. I literally cannot even buy candy with a dollar because of taxes.
[470.70s -> 474.30s]  We literally might be related. I don't know what are the six thousand people here?
[476.50s -> 482.26s]  What's the percentage that somebody in this chat might be like genetically related to me somehow?
[484.73s -> 508.14s]  It's probably fairly high. Everyone would be weird. Your mother watches the streams. Yeah but I mean
[508.94s -> 519.78s]  not somebody that I know is watching. Like I'm sure one or two of you guys in this chat have
[519.78s -> 536.30s]  shared some old like shoemaker back in like the 1400s or something. Guys don't you understand
[537.56s -> 545.00s]  there there was like 40 people on earth at one point right there was like there was like
[545.00s -> 555.38s]  2 000 people that lived in like Connecticut as of like 1442. There weren't that many people.
[566.76s -> 574.09s]  They're not even gonna score one point. Classic American. Okay somebody's cheating I think. I
[574.09s -> 580.98s]  think we have a cheater. Is somebody cheating? We might have a cheater. No I think we're just good.
[581.62s -> 594.09s]  Yeah all that mattered was you had like a little town and there was like 17 houses and like a
[594.09s -> 600.84s]  hundred people lived in your town and one of you guys sold milk the other one yeah you had corn
[600.84s -> 605.08s]  and shit and some of you guys were like tough and were like defenders and some of you guys had
[605.96s -> 609.80s]  you know you one of you guys was a blacksmith we all just like got along we all just spent this
[609.80s -> 626.23s]  bunch of time together everybody had one job and we all just did it defenders yeah I don't know
[626.23s -> 629.99s]  they'd be like fights they'd be people would kind of try to steal the corn and we'd have to have
[629.99s -> 645.08s]  somebody fight it's not gonna be me look at me I would I would be a wizard that's I would be one
[645.08s -> 651.38s]  of the fucking wizards you know what I mean oh I'm doing that thing again where I combine two
[651.38s -> 666.97s]  things one in real life and not one in real life all right never mind that's 10 to nothing
[669.11s -> 676.79s]  holy shit I feel like I'm watching fall guys this is ridiculous 12 to nothing
[681.91s -> 698.09s]  wait that means I'm on a team with a really good player six people all right if I win this one I
[698.09s -> 716.68s]  actually earned it I won one game last stream it's the tail one the only game I won last stream is
[716.68s -> 751.75s]  because the servers went offline and 35 people disconnected this guy's got it thank you what's
[751.75s -> 784.82s]  your fucking idiot they fell for the scooby-doo trick no no I cut him off come on come on he's
[784.82s -> 788.26s]  gonna go this way cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut him
[789.14s -> 808.79s]  cut him why did you do that you can't scooby-doo me I'm the original goddamn
[808.79s -> 839.59s]  fucking scooby-doo you're not gonna be able to do that oh no he saw me he saw me oh
[847.77s -> 853.77s]  he was running down there I was waiting for him to run down and he saw me at the last second he
[853.77s -> 857.05s]  instantly turned around he had freaked out and he ripped the other fucking direction
[873.86s -> 895.42s]  damn it holy shit two crowns bro you got two crowns dude pog two crowns uh yeah the first
[895.42s -> 904.54s]  one was for free because I played long enough for them to give me one the second one 35 people
[904.54s -> 929.14s]  disconnected and I outlasted them all with my fiber optic internet that's the first yeah but yes
[929.14s -> 935.48s]  I did technically it did win one I've come pretty close two or three times maybe a little bit more
[935.48s -> 941.46s]  than that I've come pretty close maybe five or six times like the final three final five
[954.68s -> 959.18s]  they really are ruining everything aren't they I'm gonna take the initiative I'm going the other
[959.18s -> 986.36s]  way I thought I could jump across stop get out of my way I every time I touch somebody I get like
[986.36s -> 1008.01s]  all over I really I'm in trouble wait a bunch of people got dumped okay who is weighing this down
[1008.73s -> 1038.71s]  he's in for a life sentence yeah I forgot the prison thing I'll get there I'll get I got it I
[1038.71s -> 1055.14s]  got it I got it when are you gonna play jailbreak on tf2 I played a bunch of jailbreak for
[1055.22s -> 1062.22s]  counter-strike a very long time ago and I actually probably have three or four videos on the subject
[1070.62s -> 1080.20s]  and they're not they're just stupid ass videos it that was so much fun though back when it was
[1080.20s -> 1103.75s]  really popular those are my only good videos I disagree but it's because I like free kill a
[1103.75s -> 1121.08s]  bunch of people in those videos do you get the stamp of your approval what's your best video in
[1121.08s -> 1129.99s]  my in your opinion um I don't think it's I can't really do that I feel like I most videos I made
[1129.99s -> 1143.02s]  I really liked for the most part yeah but I mean the live action germa rumble is like just that's
[1143.02s -> 1148.89s]  that's like just the complete was the complete package for me it just I had so much fun making
[1148.89s -> 1154.73s]  that it was so it was such a fun experience doing that and it was just so grueling to do it but
[1155.54s -> 1161.56s]  I think it was so much fun and just like yeah like this just the setup for how that came to
[1161.56s -> 1169.51s]  be in the first place was just I had a lot of fun doing it so or the uh the photos are in that was
[1169.51s -> 1185.78s]  another one that really liked that one five six all right I'm gonna be in a good position again
[1186.42s -> 1211.19s]  as long as we don't lose this in the last 10 seconds we're good choking now we're good we're
[1211.19s -> 1225.24s]  fine we're fine we're fine hey when are you gonna beat god hand um I don't know I'm not sure I'm
[1225.24s -> 1230.44s]  gonna go back to it I had my fun with it I don't know if I'm gonna do it it's a very hard game and
[1230.44s -> 1235.88s]  it makes me very very nervous and scared and anxious when I play it because I might not beat
[1235.88s -> 1252.06s]  the game and I've got to try really hard it's very hard it's fun game it's because the casino
[1252.06s -> 1267.32s]  isn't it well no grab a tail you know what everyone runs around like crazy trying desperately to grab
[1267.32s -> 1273.69s]  somebody's tail in this I'm gonna show you the way that you should play this and that is
[1274.81s -> 1279.77s]  don't do anything just hang out and just scope out like the guy in the lower right
[1280.49s -> 1286.20s]  he is hiding right now that's the guy I'm gonna keep my eye on because never mind he already lost
[1286.20s -> 1290.92s]  it you want to keep your eye on the people that are actually hiding that aren't being seen by
[1290.92s -> 1300.92s]  anybody but you this person right here is the target see them on the left that person right
[1300.92s -> 1311.00s]  there is the target like a fucking bald eagle we're gonna stalk this person and we're gonna
[1311.00s -> 1342.25s]  strike at the very last moment just give me yours he you walked right by me as you see we got the
[1342.25s -> 1360.01s]  fucking prey that we wanted I told you I was gonna get that guy I dropped a lot of people
[1368.26s -> 1372.82s]  yeah you hunted that child we already talked about this the last time I played this game
[1373.64s -> 1379.24s]  everyone says that it's a bunch of children but we're all like 30 plus at least 25 plus
[1380.63s -> 1386.07s]  everyone says though oh yeah like I've beaten all these kids and they're all just 27 like just
[1386.07s -> 1402.57s]  sitting in their houses find the path oh shit wait who knows the right way somebody move
[1408.78s -> 1415.74s]  oh get out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way out of
[1415.74s -> 1427.30s]  the way out of the way get out of my way you just have to get across the finish line that bastard
[1433.82s -> 1434.14s]  shit
[1452.55s -> 1481.42s]  you fucking asshole the first time I've ever seen that game that one's fun I okay I want more fun
[1481.42s -> 1487.18s]  weird stuff like that unless everybody run the same direction and get squished by the same door
[1487.18s -> 1495.86s]  I like stuff like that it's fun like this one this is the one I'm talking about I don't like this one
[1495.86s -> 1514.39s]  okay this one would be funny with like five people like 10 people as it stands right now
[1514.39s -> 1519.11s]  everyone just smushes everywhere and it doesn't matter it's just someone's gonna walk into one
[1519.91s -> 1530.82s]  like if this was 10 people then a bunch of people would really have problem it would be fun funny
[1530.82s -> 1544.18s]  because once one person goes through every single person knows the answer but if there was only like
[1544.18s -> 1563.86s]  four or five of us someone's gonna make a mistake he hates it
[1563.86s -> 1586.52s]  it flew across the map but you mean like actually like flew or fell like flying and
[1586.52s -> 1600.52s]  falling are two different actions like guy hacking flying and guy falling off edge got launched
[1600.52s -> 1618.70s]  remember we can see your cheat engine and this is important in a minute this is important
[1619.58s -> 1645.48s]  hug the right side they all came on the right side yeah we're good oh I just missed that one
[1646.78s -> 1649.74s]  just missed just missed just missed just missed just missed just missed
[1650.70s -> 1681.34s]  it's okay qualified he's cheating confirmed oh yeah hold on actually this is gonna be hard to do
[1681.34s -> 1691.21s]  never mind I was gonna put a full screen video of like this computer glitch noises and words
[1691.21s -> 1706.36s]  and scrambled letters and accidentally showed on stream it wasn't worth it avoid the walls and stay
[1706.36s -> 1715.02s]  on the platform this is I haven't seen this one either he didn't commit to it well I'm I'm
[1715.02s -> 1721.35s]  currently in the middle of a game where I can't really stop so what do we have to do is to fit
[1721.35s -> 1738.52s]  through what I get it this person's cheating how do you do that how do you cheat I think you have
[1738.52s -> 1746.02s]  to jump on somebody else's head you do you do you do you do you do why do I care about cheating
[1746.66s -> 1763.90s]  I could have just won that normally I didn't have to do that the definition of hubris yeah
[1768.79s -> 1774.41s]  you gotta get up there before it even starts yeah oh well shit I was doing pretty good on that one
[1774.41s -> 1799.16s]  too what happened to one or two rounds I'm still having fun I want to get to the final round again
[1799.16s -> 1814.36s]  whatever happens happens somebody fucked that whole thing up I don't know who did but
[1814.36s -> 1849.43s]  apparently it ruined everybody you can't just run forward oh no I'm in trouble I'm in trouble I got
[1851.27s -> 1863.77s]  can't lose the first round can't lose the first round man can't just lose I fell off it's just
[1865.29s -> 1869.53s]  push everybody together and somebody's always gonna get the short end of the stick
[1880.60s -> 1910.71s]  first round Andy I was in the last round before that last round Larry this is the worst fall guy
[1910.71s -> 1919.98s]  streamer I don't believe that for a second no way no way not a chance you know you know how I know
[1919.98s -> 1927.02s]  that because there are like 5 000 people playing this right now that are streaming this there's not
[1927.02s -> 1932.49s]  a chance that I'm the worst one someone's always better than you someone's always worse than you
[1932.49s -> 1950.82s]  though remember that it's important you are the worst I'm not the worst fall guys but being okay
[1950.82s -> 1967.38s]  being the worst fall guys player is just like saying yeah it's like saying you're bad at like
[1967.38s -> 1974.49s]  the jumpy house no it's you're not no one's bad at this game no one's good at this game
[1983.56s -> 1991.40s]  there is no bad there is no good there is just jumpy house he's coping you let me let me have it
[1999.88s -> 2003.32s]  you don't have to come in first place you know it doesn't matter if you come in last place you
[2003.32s -> 2014.54s]  got to jump in the jumpy house it's fine did I really not qualify I'm at the fucking finish line
[2015.50s -> 2020.38s]  shit maybe I am the worst streamer for this game I really might be the worst fall guy streamer that
[2020.38s -> 2025.70s]  I that's sad to think about my ego is getting in the way right now and it sucks like my ego
[2025.70s -> 2030.31s]  right now is like no no it's not possible Jerry but you can't be I mean that just that's two in
[2030.31s -> 2039.38s]  a row if I make it three then it's possible hey no right at least I got to jump in the jumpy house
[2040.31s -> 2055.51s]  it was kind of fun she had got to you no they didn't no don't lock me out don't lock me out
[2055.51s -> 2067.43s]  after that you didn't qualify for the next jumpy house it's called a bouncy house hey open up a
[2067.43s -> 2090.55s]  thesaurus and tell me what the word next to bouncy is jumpy is not a word jumpy is what do you mean
[2090.55s -> 2107.48s]  it's not a word there's so much jumpy oh my god you guys it's called a bouncy castle it's a
[2107.48s -> 2115.61s]  jumpy house it doesn't matter is this the hill you want to die on it's actually it's called
[2115.61s -> 2122.38s]  bouncy castle not jumpy house that's the fucking bootleg shitty version that's how you know it's
[2122.38s -> 2141.35s]  a fake oh that's funny okay I can't do three if I get three in a row then I'm the worst fall guy
[2141.35s -> 2151.86s]  streamer on twitch all right I agree with you but that's not gonna happen I'm so scared that
[2151.86s -> 2176.50s]  it's going to but it's not going to I can't be the worst fall guys player on twitch what are you
[2176.50s -> 2219.10s]  supposed to do why did you do that he knows he knows he's new not the worst fall guys player
[2219.10s -> 2236.22s]  on twitch he's screen cheating all right boogers just I just good thing this way I don't have a
[2236.22s -> 2249.13s]  camera on thank god in the middle of all this somebody just writes Resident Evil 4 not today
[2250.09s -> 2269.46s]  like inception it's just I know it's an inception campaign I'm aware of it now all right let's get
[2269.46s -> 2292.90s]  to the final round one that's not good I'll tell you I'm solely responsible for two of our points
[2292.90s -> 2302.47s]  I mean after offense and defense like that you're gonna tell me I'm the worst ball guys player on
[2302.47s -> 2333.42s]  twitch keep it over here where'd that come from no they why is blue over here is helping them
[2333.98s -> 2371.14s]  can we get one I was not the worst player I was responsible for at least three points
[2371.86s -> 2390.68s]  where the points go like I'm not the whole team the whole team has to step up and start moving
[2390.68s -> 2402.39s]  stuff yeah I'm out of prison I made it made it out an hour ago actually I got an hour and a
[2402.39s -> 2413.34s]  half ago a little less than that maybe like 40 minutes all right this is my last one I'm done
[2413.34s -> 2484.18s]  after this this is better be a good one needs to get out of jumpy prison yes it's not a bad one
[2484.18s -> 2491.83s]  it's not bad unless you are the first person to lose you can if it's 40 people as long as your
[2491.83s -> 2504.95s]  number 40 it wasn't a bad round you got in it doesn't matter it only matters when you get down
[2504.95s -> 2524.41s]  to the last round you just have to qualify and having good internet qualifies too because if
[2524.41s -> 2546.60s]  25 people drop here still counts I don't want to do this one again now how many premium skins do
[2546.60s -> 2593.46s]  we have on our team two get in there give me these ones no don't push it back I've just rolled this
[2593.54s -> 2601.02s]  dude I just rolled that guy unbelievable I just like necked myself I just like landed on my neck
[2605.37s -> 2622.31s]  how did I land how did I just connect I just landed on my neck I'm trying come on we have
[2622.31s -> 2630.71s]  an opportunity in 15 seconds here it is dude why the fuck are we always at zero points
[2634.90s -> 2651.35s]  if six fucking points I'm not done yellow always loses this is like one of those things where
[2651.35s -> 2659.61s]  somebody did the math a decade and a half ago and it was the the alliance had a slight advantage
[2659.61s -> 2670.36s]  on the lumber mill battlegrounds map what's it not the lumber what's it called the one with the
[2670.36s -> 2684.20s]  capture the flag that's it is it's a very old wow reference not a rathy no war song gulf there it
[2684.20s -> 2693.42s]  is yeah I think the alliance had a tiny actually really documented slight advantage on that map
[2693.42s -> 2714.38s]  is that yellow in this game for that exact game mode it was hoard what was the actual problem
[2714.38s -> 2724.89s]  though what was the issue I was lame and if you play it you probably smell well I guess 13 million
[2724.89s -> 2732.38s]  people smell that's probably accurate it's probably way more than that there's probably like 500
[2732.38s -> 2751.94s]  million people that smell right now in the world so get what I said oh no I jumped at the wrong
[2751.94s -> 2763.21s]  time but it's okay look at all that extra weight this guy knows yeah he knows like I
[2763.21s -> 2770.17s]  notice like I turn around he turned around he went right boy he's trying to keep me as the worst
[2770.17s -> 2777.98s]  player on twitch mine too can play that game dude see I did that wait it was this guy that wasn't I
[2777.98s -> 2805.62s]  can't tell everyone's the same no it's just about being in 40th place and then you just eventually
[2805.62s -> 2815.45s]  you get to first place have you guys ever read that book fast rabbit in the slow hair
[2816.25s -> 2833.66s]  have you guys ever read that book fast germa and purple alien they talk about that why okay I feel
[2833.66s -> 2838.70s]  like a lot of people are having a ton of problems right now why is this one so crappy why are we
[2838.70s -> 2857.54s]  just getting fucked with what's going on oh I'm the only one weighing this one down oh
[2858.50s -> 2879.54s]  I'm not gonna qualify this guy this guy no I got like grabbed and dumped off the egg
[2885.74s -> 2894.71s]  or no I'm not the worst fall guy streamer no it seems fun if you don't win yeah it's because
[2894.71s -> 2904.09s]  the going into jumpy house is fun if you it doesn't matter okay if you go in a jumpy house
[2904.09s -> 2907.53s]  and you're the first person to go in the jumpy house and the first person to leave the jumpy
[2907.53s -> 2914.04s]  house you don't go in and go I won when was the last time you heard somebody open up the doors of
[2914.04s -> 2927.51s]  a jumpy house come out and go I won was like a was there a brawl in there like all the other
[2927.51s -> 2957.74s]  people in there like unconscious like beat up have a bounce yeah you know what somebody said
[2957.74s -> 2962.54s]  bouncy house rumble it should just be a match at like the next live rumble where it's in a
[2962.54s -> 2981.66s]  jumpy house and like the shit just gets like popped that's like collapsing out of spoilers
[2981.66s -> 3003.99s]  don't worry you had the same idea I did second place lock it in we'll put it in the germ olympics
[3004.71s -> 3009.93s]  yeah for those of you that maybe didn't miss uh didn't catch the stream when we talked about this
[3009.93s -> 3018.49s]  but we're talking about having a germ olympics where I just get a bunch of like don't mind like
[3018.49s -> 3022.01s]  just like you shit-faced friends and we like do like random dumb olympic events
[3028.41s -> 3033.21s]  like to balance the egg on your head like okay who's gonna get the gold medal for that one
[3037.42s -> 3044.92s]  you like a like shot put floor exercise that was another one we're gonna do floor exercise
[3045.64s -> 3052.50s]  synchronized swimming no that's not no that's not an olympic event
[3053.30s -> 3076.25s]  bounce egg on your head is not synchronized sleeping synchronized sleeping everyone just
[3076.25s -> 3082.87s]  turns off their lights at the same time but well how would you win or isn't the group that sleeps
[3082.87s -> 3100.39s]  the longest two people in a sleeping competition they're under the covers and they're just lying
[3100.39s -> 3107.05s]  there and there's a timer and what the what the people don't know is that they've both dead
[3107.77s -> 3114.15s]  like seven days go by and it's like wow this is the most unbelievable match we've ever seen
[3114.79s -> 3124.58s]  and both of them are dead they both died keep cutting back to it like it's been like 12 days
[3125.22s -> 3139.91s]  what are you doing I don't know I wasn't even looking I wasn't looking and we're winning
[3140.79s -> 3151.54s]  that should tell you something imagine being that guy and being that good probably streaming
[3151.54s -> 3156.71s]  the game right now I wouldn't be surprised that's probably a streamer god damn it I got it why do I
[3156.71s -> 3173.54s]  have to how many people in here are streamers leave it leave it just defend these ones red's
[3173.54s -> 3189.13s]  in trouble no yes I bet you I wonder what your stream is it's probably fucking awesome

[3792.82s -> 3805.85s]  I was just like what did they say now why that one's so fucking no this game is just a carrot on a
[3805.85s -> 3811.86s]  stick nobody wins this like I could just I'm just gonna go to the store and I'm gonna get some
[3811.86s -> 3819.93s]  lottery tickets I'm just gonna scratch them I'm not gonna win those either but I'm gonna like
[3819.93s -> 3827.43s]  know I'm gonna read on the news about the guy that won 50 grand from the scratch tickets oh
[3827.43s -> 3841.78s]  that means I can do it shit I thought like ah it just takes like a lock in concentration and that
[3841.78s -> 3847.78s]  I can't do that it's impossible I don't know why I've glanced over with but if you had if
[3847.78s -> 3866.98s]  I had a cam on you would have seen like my eyes just fucking glance over you made me waste $20
[3866.98s -> 3882.92s]  opening tf2 price what what now are you sure I did that what does that have to do with me
[3889.06s -> 3911.38s]  I can't believe I looked uh it takes too much I need to get I need to have three crowns that
[3911.38s -> 3919.10s]  I never spend and I just have but I need to I need to get one legitimately one was given for
[3919.10s -> 3937.85s]  free one was no get this guy get him get this guy get this guy what am I doing complete it
[3938.49s -> 3963.06s]  that guy was waiting at the ledge and pushing people off get him so I'm gonna continue to
[3963.06s -> 3974.47s]  scratch scratch tickets this is worse than that this is like getting a scratch ticket and scratching
[3975.11s -> 3981.11s]  you don't win any money but one of the spaces that you scratch off says turn this in to get
[3981.11s -> 3988.87s]  the next layer of scratch ticket there's an even higher chance that you could win I have to just
[3988.87s -> 3997.75s]  keep going back into like the convenience store just trading back and forth until I do that seven
[3997.75s -> 4011.14s]  times six times and then this one I might win money but the ticket is free no the ticket was
[4011.22s -> 4028.60s]  not free VR lottery tickets that would be what a mess all right I'm locking in I'll see you guys
[4028.60s -> 4094.81s]  in a minute it's not a bad idea this guy gets it hey your friend just messed you up bad treadmill

[4146.82s -> 4160.49s]  that makes me scream and I don't I hate that I'm sorry I'm screaming I need to put a muzzle on
[4160.49s -> 4173.56s]  when I play these games you have more viewers now than with Riddick that's all right I mean uh that
[4173.56s -> 4178.36s]  does not that surprising to me considering that this game is incredibly popular right now on twitch
[4178.36s -> 4183.96s]  and with a bunch of people and has like a million concurrent players and the chronicles of Riddick
[4183.96s -> 4192.39s]  Butcher's Bay came out in 2004 and I think four of you played it it doesn't surprise me necessarily
[4198.07s -> 4201.83s]  it was still I liked it I thought it was good I thought it was fun it was worth playing I'll put
[4201.83s -> 4218.63s]  it that way all right this is the one win or lose win or lose that's it too many people
[4219.27s -> 4239.99s]  I did an Aquaman shirt on that was pretty cool I don't know what happened there
[4239.99s -> 4272.82s]  what's going on uh I can't keep getting lottery tickets I don't want any more lottery tickets
[4272.82s -> 4280.10s]  my car my trunk is full of them they're just crumpled up none of them are winners they all
[4280.10s -> 4304.06s]  say great job on them you gotta get the expensive ones this is it this is actually the last one I'm

[4360.23s -> 4398.04s]  kind of like quitting Jerry more quitting Quentin Tarantino what quitting when Quentin Tarantino
[4398.12s -> 4433.69s]  all right all right I've had enough Quincy Massachusetts yes that is a place oh that's my
[4433.69s -> 4469.74s]  big break right there no that thing just fucking came out of nowhere quit Fisto what happened to
[4469.74s -> 4477.35s]  the mic what's wrong with it should be fine it should sound good right now what happened
[4477.35s -> 4486.54s]  because I'm leaning back in my chair all right maybe if I have like a different voice the whole
[4486.54s -> 4496.71s]  time it'll be it'll be better okay how about this ready I'm just gonna keep this on just right here
[4497.82s -> 4509.62s]  I'm gonna pretend like it's not on I'm just gonna pitch shift myself like down 20 30 percent
[4509.62s -> 4529.32s]  okay here we go mute muted I'm not what I'm not muted I'm gonna prove that I'm not muted
[4530.55s -> 4551.11s]  are you ready pee pee poo poo okay told you just say that any of the things that chat will just go
[4551.11s -> 4571.53s]  nuts over I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose I'm gonna rip the ethernet cable up I'm focusing on this one
[4571.53s -> 4575.21s]  I'm putting my headphones and I'm putting on fucking I'm putting on like music I'm putting on
[4575.21s -> 4591.34s]  some fucking music no not doom it's gotta be something like I'm like Katy Perry firework
[4591.34s -> 4602.31s]  is what I'm thinking but I can't play that uh but that same vibe okay is there any royalty free like
[4602.31s -> 4636.15s]  Katy Perry like firework music it's a midi version I can't can I actually play a midi version I
[4636.15s -> 4671.18s]  haven't heard that in a long time can you do that lawsuit Larry wait can I not play a midi
[4671.18s -> 4686.79s]  version of a song can I play wait can I play a lawsuit version of a song oh I midi can I play
[4686.79s -> 4701.77s]  a shine the bright just open minds just open minds like the bomb of July
[4714.25s -> 4732.49s]  humans can't do that computers can sorry guys I hate to break it to you that was a cover of
[4732.49s -> 4764.26s]  Katy Perry firework okay that I'm covering that song am I did it qualify it was too close to the
[4764.26s -> 4778.90s]  original I'm gonna get flagged what do you what do you mean too close to the original if you put
[4778.90s -> 4788.20s]  that next to the original song I bet you it was so bad that it probably wasn't even like 16 percent
[4788.20s -> 4801.32s]  accurate so I don't know if I agree with that like you could run that through the fucking like
[4801.32s -> 4805.24s]  lawsuit computer and it'd be like no no then let's hear that the sound what the sound songs like and
[4805.24s -> 4811.27s]  what the singer sounds like okay that's what Katy Perry sounds like what does Terminator 5 sound
[4811.27s -> 4817.29s]  like oh this is fucking awful this is not even close he might even be singing a different song
[4817.29s -> 4829.50s]  he sucks so bad at this no no lawsuit dropped and he what team am I on blue
[4841.37s -> 4862.92s]  don't take it from me that's mine at least I got it that's all it matters oh the DMT is kicking in
[4862.92s -> 4870.55s]  no not again all right impromptu for impromptu Katy Perry trying to do that note how was that
[4871.11s -> 4887.42s]  out of 10 I want I need to know like a four what happens when it's all four
[4891.13s -> 4904.26s]  overtime literally four to ten maybe something like that I wasn't paying attention we still want
[4904.26s -> 4936.15s]  though all right why is it overtime again why are we getting overtime again if I had some practice
[4936.15s -> 4941.82s]  I think I probably could do it if I sat in the mirror for like two weeks and did it I could
[4941.90s -> 4959.40s]  probably come really close oh that's that's not this has been on the whole time I sang with this
[4959.40s -> 4973.83s]  on didn't I I had this on I sang with that on I had a pitch shift down it was pitched down
[4981.96s -> 4992.34s]  it wasn't it had to be it was never on it had the dfx light was on it had to be on all right I need
[4992.34s -> 5029.11s]  to pay attention hold on fools you went at the wrong time I couldn't go I was gonna get pushed
[5029.11s -> 5036.22s]  off if I had gone if I had gone when the first pass I would have got hit by the thing and knocked
[5036.22s -> 5060.46s]  into you guys all want to laugh anyways well I want to hear this don't take it from me that's
[5061.34s -> 5073.24s]  this is not the it was pitch shifted down don't take it from me that's firework lawyer version
[5077.80s -> 5087.51s]  oh I admit can I play it is picture sit down a tiny bit
[5094.82s -> 5114.23s]  that's pretty good that's what people were saying what's wrong with your mic
[5116.92s -> 5137.45s]  because it sounded like weird and a little lower and shitty now I get it the fourth of
[5137.45s -> 5143.45s]  july part was good but then the firework was like I hit that when you push the horn too hard
[5143.45s -> 5151.91s]  and it goes like you don't want to push the horn too hard just enough not over quit don't over
[5151.91s -> 5183.82s]  squeeze the horn I can't even see the chat right now now I can shit shit shit shit shit weigh us

[5915.54s -> 5921.38s]  Boneworks I want to do this like 10 new VR games that came out over the last six months and some
[5921.38s -> 5928.09s]  stuff that I didn't even do I didn't even finish that I would like to I want to do tilt brush for
[5928.09s -> 5934.14s]  a little while that's been I was I did it for like 10 minutes one time I was flipper had an
[5934.14s -> 5944.34s]  HDTV there's a lot to do yeah there's a ton of stuff to do so expect VR stuff soon I also want
[5944.34s -> 5948.34s]  to bring this up too because this is important I brought this up in pre-stream chat but I want to
[5948.34s -> 5957.90s]  kind of make it people aware of it now as of today or last night this work has been started
[5958.78s -> 5966.65s]  on a choose your own adventure custom-made game board that we are going to play on stream
[5967.21s -> 5979.29s]  completely inspired by sorcery there's going to be a ton of things to do tons of choices trying
[5979.29s -> 5983.45s]  to involve people that know kind of about that space and know how to use it and do things like
[5983.45s -> 5991.06s]  that there's a couple of really good art that's all folks a couple of really good artists we're
[5991.06s -> 5996.26s]  going to be making the artwork for it you know I think you probably know both of them I would
[5996.26s -> 6003.03s]  assume you know Ashley is going to be making artwork for it and uh John Silva Star is going
[6003.03s -> 6013.32s]  to be the head game essentially maker or the board maker map maker it should be a lot of fun
[6013.40s -> 6023.19s]  going to be completely custom-made just a sorcery like choose your own adventure game I'm also
[6023.19s -> 6028.73s]  going to hit up some people about it um I want to talk to Arcadium about it because he knows a ton
[6028.73s -> 6037.34s]  about this shit get a bunch of input from him because he obviously knows a lot about games
[6037.34s -> 6050.39s]  like this so but my point is is that you may hear about people working on this project and I want
[6050.47s -> 6057.56s]  you to hear it from the horse's mouth so you might see for instance if Star is talking about it or
[6057.56s -> 6061.88s]  if um like John Silva's talking about it then I want you to be like wait oh well hold on what
[6061.88s -> 6073.10s]  are you talking about so it's a real thing as of yesterday that's the scariest way to hear anything
[6076.74s -> 6084.78s]  general ETA before November that's kind of what we've decided Star is going to be doing a ton of
[6086.26s -> 6091.64s]  encounter making and we're going to sit down on a few calls and go over what I really want to
[6091.72s -> 6097.08s]  see and obviously he has a bunch of great ideas like everybody else does right but I want it to
[6097.08s -> 6104.33s]  be a kind of a blind experience that you guys get to make choices too so imagine sorcery but
[6104.33s -> 6112.86s]  it's completely custom-made about around sort of this community and you guys will be able to
[6112.86s -> 6120.97s]  participate by voting on what paths we can go down sometimes so before November of this year
[6121.61s -> 6132.71s]  is when it's supposed to happen I'll give you more updates when they come it should be a lot
[6132.71s -> 6145.32s]  of fun it's official as of yesterday what's on Sunday I'll have to figure that out over the next
[6145.32s -> 6157.40s]  few days there are a ton of options so October 31st then well maybe it could be I don't know
[6157.40s -> 6164.68s]  I get we can't give a date but Star thinks that this could all be ready at some point
[6165.24s -> 6173.96s]  either before November or just barely into November I'll figure it out though but I am
[6173.96s -> 6180.20s]  gonna go I'm gonna run I'm gonna run away because I need to eat food I'll see you guys on Sunday
[6180.20s -> 6187.24s]  we'll figure out what we're gonna do thanks for watching take care of yourselves have a great
[6187.24s -> 6193.56s]  night have a great start to your weekend I'll see you at the end of it and goodbye
