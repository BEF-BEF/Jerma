[6.46s -> 25.88s]  So I just walk around the beach? Oh nice, this is a pretty good beach party. What's that guy doing?
[26.89s -> 35.40s]  Somebody's over there using like a hand glider. There's like jet skis. Is this open world? What
[35.40s -> 45.11s]  do I want to do first? There's so many options in M&M's Beach Party. Nice. Good job. Good return.
[46.15s -> 56.34s]  Excellent return. There we go. Set it up for you. What the fuck are you doing? Why do we both suck
[56.34s -> 66.15s]  so bad? Can we get at least a volley going on? My god. Somebody please make a return. Hit it up.
[66.95s -> 72.87s]  Spike it down. Thank you very much. I'll take that point. Apparently we didn't get the point,
[72.87s -> 80.04s]  but it's okay. I'll just miss over and fucking over again. Okay, hold on. Please seriously hit
[80.04s -> 85.30s]  the fucking ball. There we go. Oh my god, how do you control how hard you hit it?
[85.94s -> 90.60s]  Is there any way to control it? I don't think so judging by the fact that nobody can seem to
[90.60s -> 101.29s]  make a good serve. I don't think it's possible. Do it. Flick the fucking potato frog thing,
[101.29s -> 110.10s]  whatever the hell this thing is. All right, I got two points. Yeah, good. This is good fun.
[110.74s -> 119.10s]  I can't wait to like to give this broken ass. What? Wait, no, it's the computer's turn?
[121.13s -> 127.11s]  The computer's like worse than I am. Wait, how come he's getting all these points? Look at his
[127.11s -> 135.99s]  points. I scored two. He got eight. He didn't get eight. He got like two. Why does he have
[135.99s -> 145.38s]  nine points right now? See, I have to spray these guys orange because I picked orange
[146.76s -> 154.66s]  and the other guys have to spray their guys, their colors. It's a blast. I mean, we're talking,
[155.30s -> 162.18s]  this is it. There's only like three different animations and you know what? Time to go try
[162.18s -> 169.70s]  hard mode because I'm winning one of these. Spray that guy. This guy coming down. I know he always
[169.70s -> 176.26s]  walks the same route. He ain't going to beat me this time. What do I need? 15. I lost again.
[176.98s -> 186.65s]  I actually came in last place. I want to ride like the jet ski. Where's the canoe?
[187.45s -> 194.18s]  Where's the canoe? Looking at the back of the box right now. Where's the canoe?
[194.82s -> 199.22s]  I bought this game because the canoe was on the back and you're telling me I can't even
[199.22s -> 207.77s]  access the canoe right now? You got to be kidding me. Do I have to unlock this next game? I must
[207.77s -> 213.64s]  have to. There's got to be some reason why that's like all boarded up and if you think for one second
[213.64s -> 219.72s]  I'm going to like five star all the games and get like the points and shit required to open
[219.72s -> 227.94s]  this gate up, no way. And you know what? I got a better idea. How about we actually play a good
[227.94s -> 233.06s]  party game? One of the best party games ever made. You probably all know which one I'm talking
[233.06s -> 239.30s]  about. It's on Nintendo. It's on the Wii featuring one of the most famous video game characters ever.
[239.30s -> 249.82s]  I'm of course talking about Pac-Man Party. Oh yeah. Pac-Man Party. Look at the party mode.
[249.82s -> 257.42s]  Got mini games, rewards. You can play classic games? You kidding me? I can play Pac-Man, Galaga,
[257.42s -> 263.29s]  Dig Dug. This is included. This is all included. I don't have to pay extra. Come on. Are you
[263.29s -> 268.41s]  kidding me? I'm like pumped up right now to like eat a bunch of spaghetti. All you're going to do
[268.41s -> 273.16s]  is you move the hand around, roll the spaghetti. All right, let's go. Let's go you fucking punks.
[274.23s -> 281.62s]  It's time to eat the spaghetti. Oh am I going to win? That guy, that's no fair. That guy's got two
[281.62s -> 290.18s]  arms. How come that guy has two forks going in? That doesn't seem real fair. Look at that. Look
[290.18s -> 298.39s]  at how much I kicked everybody's ass. I'm the master of the spaghetti roll-up. How is that guy
[298.39s -> 305.58s]  still standing by the way? Look at the guy on the left. He has like a legitimate seven. He's got a
[305.58s -> 308.78s]  backwards seven and apparently it's still standing. Doesn't matter. I'm going to win.
[311.32s -> 320.89s]  That guy is so fucked up and he's going to beat me. No. No. Give me one more. Get out of my way.
[320.89s -> 324.33s]  Got to get past the line. Got to get past the line. My ice cream needs a bit. I lost.
[324.33s -> 332.04s]  Pizza party. Oh yeah. Pizza party. I'm going to be the master of the pieces. Master of the spaghetti.
[334.02s -> 339.46s]  Hey, who remembers from like the original Pac-Man games? There's a giant spider that tries to eat
[339.46s -> 346.62s]  and kill you. It's pretty, this is like pretty canon. Can I throw this? Can I throw this giant
[346.62s -> 357.27s]  like dog bone? How long does this last? I just want to, I want to go back to eating like spaghetti.
[357.27s -> 364.42s]  I don't want to like fight. I want to eat ice cream, candy and spaghetti. See, this is what
[364.42s -> 372.57s]  I'm talking about. It's all about just eating candy and eating brownies and chocolate pudding.
[372.57s -> 380.20s]  No spiders. No scary monsters. It's just good old fun. That guy's picking the brownie. We don't want
[380.20s -> 388.14s]  to let the bomb drop on the ground and that guy you already lost. Nice job. Why would you pick that
[388.14s -> 398.73s]  piece? Nobody even got a turn to go. How does he win when nobody else had a turn to go? So pretty
[398.73s -> 404.73s]  much the moral of this story and the purpose of this video is to simply say, uh, Pac-Man is
[404.73s -> 410.95s]  unstoppable. He's unbeatable and he's the best video game character ever. And if you want to argue
[410.95s -> 416.86s]  that with me, then all I got, I got four words for you. Pac-Man is the best character ever.
[416.86s -> 422.86s]  You will never defeat him. He is a god among men and he is undeniably the greatest character ever
[422.86s -> 426.62s]  in the history of video. That was like 70 words, but you get the idea.
