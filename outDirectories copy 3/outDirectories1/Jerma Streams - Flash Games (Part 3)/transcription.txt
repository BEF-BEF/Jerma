[1.27s -> 2.71s]  What's up? How you doing?
[2.71s -> 7.34s]  There's a bird at my window. I- I- Sorry, I was like, one minute late.
[8.23s -> 12.47s]  I had to see it. I heard like, a tapping, like tap at the window.
[12.47s -> 15.03s]  I was like, this bird- Ah, it's a bird. It's definitely a bird.
[15.59s -> 21.37s]  I was like, I gotta see it. I missed him.
[21.37s -> 22.81s]  Didn't see the bird, unfortunately.
[24.22s -> 26.30s]  Uh, as you get- Listen to me. You hear the voice, right?
[26.86s -> 27.82s]  Kind of getting back to normal.
[28.62s -> 30.46s]  It's a little, uh, it's a little grungy, but, you know.
[31.90s -> 32.78s]  That's a good excuse.
[35.00s -> 36.60s]  So, uh, those of you that didn't know,
[37.32s -> 39.32s]  the reason why I've been gone for the last like, four or five days,
[40.44s -> 42.84s]  is specifically because I couldn't talk.
[44.20s -> 46.44s]  I was sick for about a week and a half,
[47.72s -> 49.80s]  with some type of cold or flu or something.
[50.44s -> 52.06s]  I tested negative for COVID.
[53.53s -> 54.17s]  That's a good thing.
[55.30s -> 57.54s]  But I- I blew out my voice.
[59.53s -> 63.93s]  The day after that last stream, I sounded like this.
[63.93s -> 65.05s]  I couldn't even talk.
[65.69s -> 67.21s]  It was- I blew my voice out somehow.
[71.85s -> 72.81s]  How am I talking now?
[74.30s -> 76.06s]  Um, because that was a week ago.
[77.18s -> 82.70s]  Gion Rivers, yeah.
[85.02s -> 86.70s]  No, the last ti- Yeah, don't we know?
[86.70s -> 88.14s]  When I turned the stream on last,
[88.14s -> 90.46s]  that's the last time that I was like, alive.
[91.51s -> 93.51s]  I just go into like, hibernation.
[93.51s -> 96.07s]  I go- You just power me off and then you turn me back on.
[96.71s -> 97.83s]  Hold on, I gotta get auto.
[117.54s -> 118.98s]  But no, I'm feeling a lot better.
[118.98s -> 121.78s]  I haven't been sick for probably at least a few days.
[122.58s -> 125.46s]  But I've just barely, last night into today,
[126.26s -> 130.68s]  I haven't had a just completely constricted, horrendous voice.
[131.48s -> 132.36s]  So I didn't want to talk.
[133.08s -> 134.28s]  So I'm trying to keep my mouth shut.
[136.47s -> 137.43s]  And here we are now.
[137.43s -> 138.23s]  I should be fine.
[139.91s -> 142.07s]  Scrap this shit for an auto stream.
[144.26s -> 149.14s]  Oh, I just want to like, chill and like, play flash games.
[149.14s -> 150.66s]  What do you mean, scrap this shit?
[150.66s -> 153.06s]  People have been asking for flash games for like, a year.
[153.94s -> 155.86s]  I'm not gonna play cyberpunk.
[156.58s -> 159.99s]  I probably- I don't know.
[159.99s -> 161.99s]  I probably will never play cyberpunk.
[161.99s -> 163.61s]  You want me to be honest?
[166.07s -> 167.11s]  It's probably cool.
[167.11s -> 167.59s]  I don't know.
[171.19s -> 172.15s]  Maybe eventually.
[173.30s -> 175.22s]  You mean like, look, I'm like-
[175.22s -> 178.50s]  I play new games a year after they come out.
[179.30s -> 180.50s]  Or like, at least a few months.
[181.22s -> 182.84s]  What is this?
[182.84s -> 186.82s]  Hold on.
[186.82s -> 187.78s]  Cyberpunk sucks.
[188.50s -> 188.98s]  Does it though?
[188.98s -> 189.86s]  I mean, I don't think it does.
[190.50s -> 191.22s]  Who told you that?
[191.78s -> 195.64s]  We had a bunch of subs come in.
[195.64s -> 199.88s]  Thank you, Nukable, Super Bruce, Bananarism, and TheFooly.
[199.88s -> 201.24s]  All for five community subs.
[201.24s -> 202.52s]  Back to back to back to back to back.
[203.32s -> 204.89s]  Thanks guys.
[209.24s -> 210.60s]  All bugs, no snacks.
[211.64s -> 213.08s]  But yeah, how- is it- is it any good?
[213.88s -> 217.27s]  Do a cheese and wine tasting stream.
[217.27s -> 218.79s]  I didn't even tweet this stream out yet.
[218.79s -> 219.51s]  Hold on.
[219.51s -> 222.07s]  Everybody- it says in the title, just chill, okay?
[226.58s -> 228.98s]  Five subs from any neb subs here.
[229.78s -> 232.10s]  I don't know.
[232.10s -> 232.50s]  Are there?
[233.06s -> 244.58s]  Jerma, please, we need the funny.
[245.30s -> 246.82s]  That's what I'm doing here, man.
[246.82s -> 248.50s]  I'm trying to come back so I can give you the funny.
[249.30s -> 252.50s]  I almost just like cough- like, flam-puked on you.
[252.50s -> 253.86s]  And that would have been horrible.
[253.86s -> 254.50s]  Some of you heard it.
[255.14s -> 256.66s]  Some of you were like, I heard that.
[256.66s -> 259.06s]  That was like phlegm coming up from like your esophagus
[259.06s -> 259.78s]  all the way into your mouth.
[260.42s -> 260.98s]  You heard it.
[260.98s -> 262.18s]  I know some of you did.
[262.18s -> 263.70s]  That's why it took a little bit of time.
[265.85s -> 269.77s]  Also, we have to talk really quickly about, of course,
[269.77s -> 272.89s]  that an anonymous gifter has given five community subs.
[273.61s -> 278.38s]  Besides that, in the Discord right now,
[279.10s -> 280.95s]  guess what channel just opened?
[281.59s -> 283.74s]  Come on, let's see some slugpogs.
[284.62s -> 288.06s]  Uh, the New Year's Eve nomination and discussion channel is open.
[288.70s -> 290.50s]  You're going to be able to nominate stuff.
[291.14s -> 292.66s]  Maybe even add categories.
[292.66s -> 294.10s]  It's just open for discussion.
[294.10s -> 296.98s]  It's going to be up there for another probably eight to ten days.
[299.02s -> 301.02s]  The voting will commence after that.
[302.25s -> 307.10s]  So you got about ten days to figure out your nominations for the year.
[307.74s -> 310.87s]  Cyberpunk in two hours?
[310.87s -> 311.83s]  I'm not- I don't care.
[312.95s -> 315.56s]  Look, I'm up playing Cyberpunk.
[316.20s -> 324.71s]  That's a Reddit game.
[324.71s -> 325.91s]  It's not a Reddit game.
[328.41s -> 331.37s]  No, that's a mainstream, huge video game.
[331.37s -> 332.89s]  So many people are waiting for that.
[332.89s -> 335.93s]  That's not just like Redditors that are waiting to play Cyberpunk.
[335.93s -> 338.57s]  That game had like 600 million pre-orders.
[339.98s -> 342.22s]  Only like 12 million people use Reddit.
[344.20s -> 345.40s]  Okay, I gotta- I gotta retweet this.
[345.40s -> 348.73s]  Hold on.
[348.73s -> 349.93s]  It's a Reddit game.
[352.25s -> 357.05s]  I just wrote Cyberpunk and then for like my stream,
[357.05s -> 358.09s]  but no, I can't do that.
[358.09s -> 358.89s]  That's misleading.
[365.62s -> 366.82s]  No, I'm not going to do that.
[366.82s -> 368.82s]  I'm not going to piss people off for no reason.
[369.38s -> 371.40s]  Although I kind of do that anyways sometimes.
[371.40s -> 372.84s]  I do that like for fun all the time.
[373.94s -> 374.90s]  I didn't even say a title.
[374.90s -> 376.42s]  I just wrote my stream.
[376.42s -> 376.92s]  Fuck.
[377.30s -> 377.94s]  It's been a week.
[377.94s -> 378.98s]  Give me a- give me a minute.
[380.14s -> 381.98s]  Flash games, dude.
[383.02s -> 384.30s]  I'm so high right now.
[385.18s -> 386.22s]  It took so much.
[386.94s -> 387.98s]  Flash games, dude.
[390.84s -> 391.96s]  I'm not- I'm kidding.
[391.96s -> 392.28s]  I'm not.
[392.28s -> 393.40s]  And then take- I haven't-
[393.40s -> 397.08s]  I have not consumed a marijuana product in probably three weeks, okay?
[397.72s -> 398.22s]  Relax.
[405.67s -> 406.17s]  Clip it.
[406.79s -> 407.91s]  You can play Dead Space?
[408.71s -> 411.03s]  Yeah, maybe like eventually before I turn 40.
[411.99s -> 414.55s]  Oh, I'm assuming that before I turn 40, I'll play Dead Space.
[415.35s -> 417.62s]  Oh, you'll see it before I turn 40.
[418.26s -> 419.51s]  All right.
[419.51s -> 420.07s]  You guys ready?
[420.71s -> 422.42s]  You guys ready for the-
[422.42s -> 423.06s]  I don't even- hold on.
[423.06s -> 424.10s]  Wait, let me make sure my-
[424.74s -> 426.34s]  Because I know everyone's going to freak out and be like,
[426.34s -> 427.62s]  dude, why do you not have click maps?
[427.62s -> 428.26s]  Come on, dude.
[429.14s -> 430.26s]  I'm going to have them, but I'm going to-
[430.26s -> 431.86s]  It's going to be streamer's choice and then your choice.
[433.18s -> 435.10s]  I'm on congregate and I'm on armor games.
[435.90s -> 437.50s]  If I missed one, please tell me I missed one.
[437.50s -> 439.02s]  But I'm just going to play some flash games.
[439.02s -> 439.74s]  Whatever. Let's go.
[443.02s -> 444.30s]  Let me just get the click maps running.
[452.38s -> 453.42s]  No, not Neopets.
[455.08s -> 456.36s]  Neopets is- I don't know.
[457.48s -> 458.52s]  I'm not playing Neopets.
[458.52s -> 459.00s]  Holy shit.
[459.00s -> 460.36s]  Like how- You know what I want to see?
[461.42s -> 462.86s]  Am I not logged into Twitch?
[464.17s -> 465.13s]  What the fuck?
[466.62s -> 468.22s]  I got logged out of Twitch?
[468.78s -> 471.42s]  Have I not been- Have I not opened it in like three- two weeks?
[481.11s -> 482.31s]  No, I have to like- Hold on.
[483.30s -> 484.66s]  You got to feed your little gremlin.
[484.66s -> 486.02s]  I don't- No, I don't want to do Neopets.
[486.02s -> 486.50s]  They'll die.
[487.64s -> 488.92s]  I'll do a Neopets stream.
[488.92s -> 490.12s]  We'll hang out for a little while.
[491.40s -> 492.68s]  And it'll be- Aw, cool.
[492.68s -> 494.28s]  You got like a little octopus buddy.
[495.16s -> 496.04s]  Dude, oh my god.
[496.04s -> 497.56s]  You fed him like his favorite treat.
[497.56s -> 498.68s]  Like octopus food.
[498.68s -> 500.28s]  Everyone will freak out and it'll be fine.
[500.28s -> 502.44s]  And then I'll never hear the end of it when after two or three weeks
[502.44s -> 503.64s]  when I don't play the game
[503.64s -> 505.48s]  and people say check on your Neopets and they're all dead.
[506.44s -> 507.88s]  You guys are going to be very upset with me
[507.88s -> 508.68s]  and I don't want to do that.
[510.20s -> 514.42s]  True. Yeah, I know.
[514.42s -> 515.38s]  I'm- I know.
[515.38s -> 516.02s]  Trust me. I know.
[518.78s -> 519.42s]  All right.
[519.42s -> 521.18s]  Let me turn on- Let me get click maps ready.
[521.90s -> 523.34s]  Because I know everyone's going to say,
[523.34s -> 524.38s]  do it, do it, do it.
[524.38s -> 526.14s]  You're fucking making me so angry.
[526.14s -> 527.42s]  You're pissing me off Jeremy.
[527.42s -> 528.54s]  There's no click maps.
[529.26s -> 530.78s]  I'm going to punch you in the mouth.
[530.78s -> 532.38s]  I'm going to punch you as hard as I can in the mouth.
[533.26s -> 533.90s]  Like, all right.
[533.90s -> 534.86s]  Well, just relax.
[534.86s -> 535.58s]  It's in the title.
[536.38s -> 538.57s]  Okay.
[538.57s -> 539.53s]  Uh, shall we?
[539.53s -> 540.25s]  What should I start with?
[540.25s -> 541.37s]  Kongregate or Armored Games?
[541.37s -> 542.33s]  I guess it doesn't really matter, right?
[542.33s -> 543.53s]  We'll go to Armored Games first.
[549.13s -> 550.49s]  Why are people already doing click maps?
[551.05s -> 552.87s]  Stop clicking on the screen.
[552.87s -> 553.51s]  It's not ready yet.
[555.10s -> 555.74s]  Stop clicking.
[555.74s -> 556.70s]  I have to- I just turned it off.
[558.82s -> 559.86s]  Viruses everywhere.
[559.86s -> 561.06s]  There's no viruses here.
[561.06s -> 561.94s]  Relax.
[561.94s -> 562.58s]  It's in the title.
[563.38s -> 563.94s]  Come on, quit.
[568.28s -> 569.00s]  Hey, we get it.
[569.00s -> 569.64s]  You smoke.
[569.64s -> 570.20s]  I don't.
[571.45s -> 572.41s]  So what should I play?
[572.41s -> 573.59s]  What we got?
[573.59s -> 574.39s]  These are new games.
[574.39s -> 575.59s]  How about Bouncy Quest?
[575.59s -> 576.79s]  Is Bouncy Quest any good?
[579.00s -> 580.44s]  Has anybody played Bouncy Quest?
[582.60s -> 582.92s]  I don't know.
[582.92s -> 583.40s]  Let's try it.
[584.52s -> 586.04s]  Oh, can I make this full screen?
[586.04s -> 587.24s]  Please tell me I can.
[587.24s -> 591.53s]  Turn it on.
[591.53s -> 592.09s]  I just did.
[594.33s -> 594.73s]  Loading.
[594.73s -> 595.05s]  Okay.
[595.05s -> 597.45s]  Is there a full screen in- on, uh, Armored Games?
[599.05s -> 599.55s]  Ow!
[603.24s -> 604.76s]  This just happened in real life.
[605.83s -> 608.63s]  I- that's- I seriously feel like I got hit in the head by a frying pan.
[609.82s -> 611.66s]  I got hit right in the fucking head by a frying pan.
[611.74s -> 613.42s]  I gotta turn this on in my mixer.
[613.42s -> 616.84s]  I- I know that's- I feel like that's what it would feel like.
[618.22s -> 618.78s]  Jesus.
[622.73s -> 624.17s]  I end up with like-
[624.17s -> 624.57s]  Okay.
[624.57s -> 625.21s]  Is that better?
[626.33s -> 627.45s]  Am I gonna zoom this shit in?
[628.01s -> 632.30s]  The hell?
[632.30s -> 636.66s]  I have to manual zoom?
[637.30s -> 639.59s]  Is a dev in chat?
[640.39s -> 640.87s]  No, no, no.
[640.87s -> 641.19s]  Leave it.
[641.19s -> 641.43s]  Leave it.
[641.43s -> 642.15s]  What do you mean leave it?
[642.15s -> 642.95s]  Control plus.
[642.95s -> 644.87s]  No, I- I'm gonna- I'm gonna do a manual zoom.
[654.42s -> 654.58s]  No.
[654.58s -> 656.34s]  Hey, we're doing the Game Awards tomorrow, by the way.
[656.34s -> 658.10s]  Those of you that make it excited over that one.
[661.11s -> 661.35s]  All right.
[661.35s -> 662.31s]  We got the manual zoom.
[663.98s -> 664.86s]  What the fuck?
[664.86s -> 667.69s]  What just happened?
[667.69s -> 669.64s]  I'm supposed to be playing Bouncy Quest.
[670.20s -> 672.17s]  Did I just open up like an ad page?
[673.70s -> 674.18s]  Okay.
[674.18s -> 674.34s]  Wait.
[674.34s -> 675.78s]  Now it's not zoomed in for me, though.
[675.78s -> 677.22s]  This needs to be zoomed in.
[677.22s -> 679.74s]  Oh, I need to do a manual zoom on my own.
[679.74s -> 680.62s]  Control plus, right?
[681.35s -> 681.67s]  Okay.
[681.67s -> 682.07s]  I got it.
[682.07s -> 682.39s]  I got it.
[682.39s -> 682.55s]  I got it.
[682.55s -> 682.79s]  I got it.
[682.79s -> 683.51s]  I manual zoom.
[683.51s -> 685.59s]  I have to manual zoom and then I'm gonna manual zoom you out.
[696.57s -> 697.21s]  Omega low.
[698.09s -> 698.49s]  Quiet.
[700.58s -> 700.98s]  Quiet.
[701.62s -> 702.17s]  All right.
[702.17s -> 702.73s]  That was-
[702.73s -> 703.21s]  Now we're fine.
[703.21s -> 704.49s]  We're playing Bouncy Quest.
[704.49s -> 704.73s]  All right.
[704.73s -> 705.21s]  How do we play?
[706.78s -> 708.14s]  Oh, this has got a good soundtrack.
[710.94s -> 711.50s]  Super foil.
[711.50s -> 712.54s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[714.76s -> 715.40s]  Level select.
[715.40s -> 716.20s]  Level one.
[716.20s -> 716.92s]  Bouncy Quest.
[717.48s -> 718.78s]  How do you play Boun-
[718.78s -> 719.26s]  How do you play?
[720.68s -> 721.08s]  Save your-
[721.08s -> 722.20s]  Use the arrow keys to move.
[722.84s -> 724.87s]  Okay.
[724.87s -> 725.43s]  There's one.
[726.46s -> 727.66s]  It's not centered.
[727.66s -> 727.98s]  All right.
[727.98s -> 728.94s]  Just hold on.
[728.94s -> 729.58s]  I'm trying.
[729.58s -> 730.70s]  I'm working on it.
[730.70s -> 738.30s]  There.
[738.30s -> 738.78s]  Is it better?
[739.96s -> 740.36s]  That's better.
[740.36s -> 740.60s]  Okay.
[740.60s -> 741.00s]  We're fine.
[742.71s -> 743.03s]  All right.
[743.03s -> 743.51s]  Let's go.
[745.02s -> 745.50s]  Let's go.
[748.62s -> 749.74s]  Hey, Syrophunk.
[749.74s -> 750.14s]  No.
[750.14s -> 751.02s]  Fuck Syrophunk.
[751.02s -> 752.54s]  We're playing Bouncy Quest.
[756.89s -> 758.81s]  Play this is the only level.
[758.81s -> 759.77s]  Watch out for spikes.
[762.28s -> 763.08s]  This is fun.
[763.08s -> 763.72s]  I like this.
[763.72s -> 764.60s]  How do you jump higher?
[764.92s -> 766.44s]  That one's extra bouncy quest.
[767.16s -> 769.99s]  This is the only level.
[772.15s -> 773.19s]  Obviously, this is level four.
[773.19s -> 773.91s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[773.91s -> 775.03s]  Watch out for enemy slime.
[776.36s -> 777.48s]  Jump on to eliminate.
[779.40s -> 780.28s]  I said that right, right?
[780.28s -> 780.84s]  Eliminate.
[781.40s -> 782.20s]  Did I say that wrong?
[782.76s -> 783.48s]  That was weird, right?
[789.96s -> 791.00s]  Thank you for winning those.
[791.00s -> 791.80s]  What?
[791.80s -> 797.51s]  This dude is zonked.
[798.78s -> 800.30s]  I'm not zonked.
[800.30s -> 803.83s]  Dude, when does Syrophunk come out?
[803.83s -> 804.63s]  Oh, dude.
[804.63s -> 805.51s]  Syrophunk.
[806.41s -> 806.89s]  What?
[806.89s -> 807.61s]  When they-
[807.61s -> 808.81s]  Do not leap when they sleep.
[811.14s -> 813.22s]  Hey, I got a cyber game for you.
[813.22s -> 814.39s]  Hey, guys.
[814.39s -> 818.23s]  I got a cyber game early.
[820.12s -> 821.48s]  Oh, he did, didn't he?
[822.12s -> 827.30s]  Does he get an early copy of-
[827.30s -> 828.50s]  Does he have a copy of a game
[828.50s -> 831.69s]  that people don't have right now?
[831.69s -> 832.73s]  I wonder what that could be.
[834.04s -> 834.68s]  Of course.
[834.68s -> 837.00s]  I mean, please don't be naked.
[837.00s -> 840.84s]  Of course, I'm talking about Siberia.
[840.84s -> 844.97s]  27, 2027.
[844.97s -> 849.34s]  Siberia, the year 2027 for the 3DO.
[850.42s -> 851.62s]  You don't think I came prepared
[851.62s -> 852.34s]  for the launch of-
[852.34s -> 853.62s]  This is the right one, right?
[853.62s -> 863.66s]  This is the right one.
[863.66s -> 865.34s]  Mom, your mother at GameStop
[865.34s -> 867.34s]  that buys you the wrong game.
[870.34s -> 871.06s]  No, mom.
[872.26s -> 873.78s]  I didn't want the SpongeBob game.
[873.78s -> 874.90s]  I wanted GTA.
[876.89s -> 878.09s]  Henry, you're 14.
[878.81s -> 880.25s]  Mom, buy me that game
[880.25s -> 890.89s]  where you can see naked people.
[890.89s -> 891.53s]  Hey, idiot.
[891.53s -> 891.77s]  What?
[893.34s -> 894.06s]  Fuck, hold on.
[894.06s -> 894.94s]  This game's cool.
[895.66s -> 896.54s]  Siberia.
[897.59s -> 899.48s]  You got an emote.
[899.48s -> 899.96s]  I did?
[899.96s -> 900.28s]  Why?
[903.83s -> 904.39s]  Make sure you-
[904.39s -> 905.35s]  Do the nominations, guys.
[905.35s -> 906.31s]  Make sure you get some nominations
[906.31s -> 907.75s]  and you only got like 10 days.
[907.75s -> 911.78s]  How do I keep dying from the same person?
[911.78s -> 912.66s]  It's like, have I not-
[912.66s -> 913.78s]  Have I not burned in my memory
[913.78s -> 914.98s]  that that person is here?
[914.98s -> 924.76s]  This music's pretty good, though, I will say.
[924.76s -> 926.31s]  What's this game called?
[926.31s -> 935.88s]  Bouncy Castle?
[935.88s -> 936.68s]  Dev here?
[936.68s -> 937.86s]  Where's the dev?
[937.86s -> 939.51s]  Do you want to know where the dev is?
[943.02s -> 943.98s]  Certified idiot.
[943.98s -> 944.30s]  What?
[944.30s -> 945.02s]  I'm doing fine.
[951.77s -> 952.89s]  I'm fine.
[952.89s -> 953.53s]  Look at chat.
[954.09s -> 954.89s]  Stop!
[954.89s -> 955.93s]  Leave me alone.
[955.93s -> 956.57s]  No screaming.
[956.57s -> 957.69s]  My voice is gone.
[957.69s -> 959.29s]  I just looked over at chat.
[959.29s -> 960.97s]  I have not had any Marijuana products
[960.97s -> 962.17s]  in like three weeks, okay?
[962.17s -> 967.64s]  Relax.
[967.64s -> 969.56s]  Thank you BBB for the five community-
[969.56s -> 970.52s]  A lot of community subs today.
[970.52s -> 971.16s]  What are you guys doing?
[976.14s -> 977.42s]  I think I'm done with-
[977.42s -> 977.74s]  Okay.
[977.74s -> 979.58s]  I'm done with fucking Bouncy Quest.
[979.58s -> 981.66s]  I swear to God, I'm not like pretending.
[981.66s -> 982.70s]  I gotta beat this level, though.
[982.70s -> 983.90s]  I'm not pretending.
[985.90s -> 987.50s]  By the way, speaking of pretending,
[987.50s -> 992.39s]  that is a new category in the 2020
[992.39s -> 995.85s]  Vest of Worst of the Year.
[995.85s -> 998.89s]  In your nominations for the new category of Worst,
[998.89s -> 1001.21s]  he is pretending moment where you thought
[1001.21s -> 1002.33s]  I had to have been making it up.
[1002.33s -> 1003.69s]  There's no way it would be fake.
[1003.69s -> 1005.72s]  There's no way it would be real, I mean.
[1016.66s -> 1017.46s]  I'm not.
[1017.46s -> 1023.59s]  I swear to God.
[1023.59s -> 1024.39s]  I promise.
[1026.41s -> 1028.50s]  Bouncy Louncy?
[1028.50s -> 1029.06s]  What?
[1029.06s -> 1031.05s]  I had timed that person out.
[1031.05s -> 1032.01s]  I don't know what they said.
[1032.01s -> 1032.97s]  All right, I'm done.
[1032.97s -> 1034.73s]  I'm done with Bouncy Castle.
[1034.73s -> 1036.33s]  I don't want to play it anymore.
[1036.33s -> 1038.33s]  No more Bouncy Castle for me.
[1038.33s -> 1040.49s]  This is so easy.
[1040.49s -> 1040.81s]  And I just-
[1040.81s -> 1042.25s]  I'm just like not paying attention.
[1042.25s -> 1043.29s]  Pay attention.
[1043.29s -> 1059.58s]  I'm so glad I didn't decide to play Spelunky 2 today.
[1059.58s -> 1061.02s]  It's just not one of those days, right?
[1061.02s -> 1061.74s]  You can already tell.
[1062.30s -> 1063.66s]  It's not one of those days.
[1063.66s -> 1065.72s]  I beat it, see?
[1065.72s -> 1067.08s]  Are you gonna cry on New Year's?
[1067.08s -> 1068.36s]  Are you gonna cry on New Year's?
[1068.36s -> 1068.84s]  What?
[1068.84s -> 1069.56s]  What are you talking about?
[1071.94s -> 1073.62s]  Jump on top to break.
[1073.62s -> 1083.96s]  It's one.
[1083.96s -> 1084.46s]  Wink.
[1084.92s -> 1088.14s]  Wink.
[1088.14s -> 1092.54s]  Stop breaking them, you dickhead.
[1092.54s -> 1093.66s]  I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do.
[1093.66s -> 1094.46s]  Can you see the mouse?
[1094.46s -> 1095.18s]  Oh, shit.
[1095.18s -> 1096.54s]  That's what everybody was yelling at me for.
[1097.34s -> 1098.14s]  Sorry.
[1098.14s -> 1099.50s]  Everybody was screaming at me.
[1099.50s -> 1099.98s]  They were like,
[1100.78s -> 1101.90s]  Get it off the screen.
[1101.90s -> 1102.78s]  Get it off.
[1102.78s -> 1108.15s]  All right, I gotta beat one more level in Bouncy Quest
[1108.15s -> 1110.39s]  and then we're gonna move on to the next one.
[1110.39s -> 1110.95s]  Whatever it is.
[1110.95s -> 1112.46s]  I don't know.
[1112.46s -> 1112.94s]  I'm like-
[1112.94s -> 1113.66s]  No, we're done.
[1113.66s -> 1119.66s]  How about Idle Racing?
[1120.47s -> 1122.39s]  Simplified racing game where you don't actually race
[1122.39s -> 1124.87s]  but manage cars, garages, and races.
[1125.35s -> 1130.66s]  Each race has its upgrades in racing.
[1130.66s -> 1131.70s]  Our choice now.
[1131.70s -> 1132.20s]  Okay.
[1132.90s -> 1134.26s]  Well, it has to be on a page.
[1135.59s -> 1136.39s]  Let me choose.
[1136.39s -> 1136.95s]  Let me choose.
[1136.95s -> 1138.23s]  All right, well, okay, hold on.
[1138.23s -> 1142.07s]  You guys wanna choose one here?
[1142.07s -> 1150.02s]  Okay, you guys can choose one here.
[1150.02s -> 1162.89s]  Go ahead.
[1162.89s -> 1163.29s]  Today?
[1164.82s -> 1168.60s]  Oh.
[1168.60s -> 1169.88s]  Make him do a puzzle game.
[1171.06s -> 1172.42s]  Because there's zero waiting room.
[1172.42s -> 1173.46s]  I'll go back to that-
[1173.46s -> 1174.90s]  I'll go back to that after the game awards.
[1175.54s -> 1179.06s]  Just let one random person choose.
[1179.62s -> 1180.90s]  Maybe I'll do that eventually.
[1180.90s -> 1181.78s]  I'm just hanging out today.
[1181.78s -> 1183.22s]  I'm just trying to ease back into it, man.
[1184.86s -> 1186.14s]  All right, looks like we have-
[1186.14s -> 1187.26s]  I mean, I said I-
[1187.26s -> 1188.62s]  The streamer said the thing.
[1188.62s -> 1190.38s]  So that's why everybody clicked it, right?
[1190.38s -> 1193.64s]  I guess we're gonna do Idle Racing for a little while.
[1193.64s -> 1194.76s]  See how much I like it.
[1194.76s -> 1196.44s]  Hey, Under Armour, thanks for the five-
[1196.44s -> 1197.56s]  That's not your name.
[1197.56s -> 1203.13s]  Under Andrew, thanks for the five community subs.
[1203.13s -> 1204.73s]  All right, we'll do an Idle Racing.
[1204.73s -> 1205.45s]  Thanks for voting.
[1206.01s -> 1209.19s]  See if this game's any good.
[1216.09s -> 1216.65s]  Rigged.
[1216.65s -> 1217.82s]  I wasn't rigged.
[1219.51s -> 1221.03s]  Play This Is The Only Level.
[1222.71s -> 1224.87s]  All right, I'll play This Is The Only Level in like a-
[1224.87s -> 1225.35s]  In a minute.
[1225.91s -> 1229.24s]  Idle Racing, buy your first car and start-
[1229.24s -> 1229.72s]  Hold on.
[1229.72s -> 1230.92s]  You guys, this is way too-
[1230.92s -> 1231.72s]  This is messed up here.
[1231.72s -> 1232.36s]  Hold on.
[1232.36s -> 1240.57s]  You're gonna play the game I want.
[1241.69s -> 1243.40s]  All right, that's better, right?
[1243.96s -> 1245.99s]  You're gonna play the game I want.
[1247.34s -> 1248.62s]  I probably will eventually.
[1248.62s -> 1249.66s]  You just gotta be patient.
[1250.65s -> 1252.65s]  Okay, buy your first car and start racing.
[1252.65s -> 1253.37s]  Go to dealer.
[1255.02s -> 1255.98s]  No sponsor.
[1255.98s -> 1257.02s]  Compact car.
[1257.02s -> 1257.66s]  I like those.
[1258.62s -> 1259.34s]  Family car.
[1260.71s -> 1261.27s]  No sponsor.
[1261.27s -> 1261.91s]  City car.
[1261.91s -> 1264.57s]  Or off-road.
[1264.57s -> 1265.37s]  Let us pick.
[1265.37s -> 1266.01s]  No.
[1266.01s -> 1268.18s]  All right, well, I wanna do a city car.
[1268.90s -> 1271.78s]  Probably, I don't know, the Simpsons car?
[1271.78s -> 1274.94s]  Okay, I'm gonna do the Simpsons.
[1274.94s -> 1275.74s]  Homer Simpson's car.
[1275.74s -> 1276.94s]  How much money do I have?
[1276.94s -> 1279.43s]  Where's my money?
[1279.43s -> 1283.30s]  City, 5300.
[1283.30s -> 1283.94s]  Where's my money?
[1284.50s -> 1289.18s]  Wait, is this an ad?
[1289.18s -> 1293.19s]  Go to the dealer.
[1293.19s -> 1293.83s]  Buy your first-
[1293.83s -> 1294.55s]  No sponsor.
[1294.55s -> 1295.11s]  Compact.
[1295.11s -> 1299.32s]  Oh, I just have to get one of these.
[1300.04s -> 1300.52s]  I don't have-
[1300.52s -> 1301.00s]  Oh, I have-
[1301.00s -> 1301.64s]  Where's my money?
[1302.20s -> 1303.50s]  This is how much money I have.
[1306.81s -> 1309.29s]  Oh, okay, it's up there.
[1309.29s -> 1310.78s]  It's a little too big.
[1310.78s -> 1311.10s]  Hold on.
[1314.97s -> 1319.02s]  Just look, you fucking dope.
[1319.02s -> 1322.12s]  Okay, I'm just gonna get a basic compact car.
[1322.12s -> 1323.88s]  One acceleration, one speed,
[1323.88s -> 1326.65s]  one hindrance.
[1326.65s -> 1327.45s]  Bought it.
[1327.45s -> 1329.69s]  Okay, now we go to the race.
[1330.49s -> 1334.87s]  This one here, free race.
[1334.87s -> 1336.31s]  First place gets $50.
[1336.31s -> 1337.75s]  Takes five seconds.
[1337.75s -> 1338.55s]  Select my car.
[1338.55s -> 1339.35s]  I'm gonna be using-
[1339.35s -> 1340.71s]  The winning chance is bad on this one,
[1340.71s -> 1341.43s]  but okay, race.
[1346.94s -> 1348.92s]  Okay, I'm done.
[1348.92s -> 1351.32s]  Give me another one.
[1351.88s -> 1352.52s]  I don't wanna do this.
[1353.08s -> 1353.98s]  I wanna get a better one.
[1353.98s -> 1354.46s]  This game's-
[1354.46s -> 1355.18s]  I don't know.
[1355.18s -> 1356.86s]  This is like a game that you sit on the toilet
[1356.86s -> 1357.74s]  and play for like four hours.
[1357.74s -> 1359.02s]  All right, give me another one.
[1359.02s -> 1361.93s]  What was it called?
[1361.93s -> 1362.89s]  This is the Only Level?
[1362.89s -> 1364.09s]  Should I play that one?
[1364.09s -> 1367.32s]  Or do Simpocalypse?
[1368.12s -> 1369.08s]  Streamer's Choice.
[1369.08s -> 1380.02s]  Guys, I'm gonna be here all night.
[1380.02s -> 1380.50s]  We're good.
[1380.50s -> 1382.18s]  I'll be here for like at least five hours.
[1382.90s -> 1384.26s]  This is the demo version.
[1384.90s -> 1387.70s]  Standalone game with all unlocked features
[1387.70s -> 1393.51s]  is coming to Steam on December 15th, 2020.
[1393.51s -> 1394.01s]  Uh-oh.
[1396.50s -> 1398.26s]  So, should I play the demo?
[1398.26s -> 1398.98s]  What if I like it?
[1402.04s -> 1403.00s]  Sign up for the beta.
[1403.64s -> 1405.62s]  Hold on, it's too zoomed in.
[1405.62s -> 1409.64s]  I'm not gonna put my email in anywhere.
[1410.36s -> 1413.88s]  How would I put my email in?
[1419.80s -> 1420.52s]  Do it, do it.
[1421.53s -> 1422.33s]  Guys, you got-
[1422.33s -> 1423.13s]  Some of you might remember,
[1423.85s -> 1424.97s]  back in the day,
[1425.77s -> 1426.81s]  there would be a mall.
[1427.70s -> 1428.66s]  Just, they would-
[1428.66s -> 1430.42s]  Well, of course, there would be a mall.
[1430.42s -> 1431.86s]  You know, back then when there were malls.
[1432.74s -> 1434.02s]  At your mall,
[1434.02s -> 1435.77s]  there used to be a little drop box
[1435.77s -> 1438.01s]  where you would just sign up to try to win something.
[1438.01s -> 1439.38s]  You would put all your information on it
[1439.38s -> 1440.42s]  and drop it into a little box
[1440.42s -> 1442.98s]  and hope you like got like your name on a list or something.
[1442.98s -> 1444.18s]  Or you got where-
[1444.18s -> 1445.30s]  This is like-
[1445.30s -> 1448.02s]  This is dropping your name in that like mall box
[1448.02s -> 1451.30s]  of signing up for shit.
[1451.30s -> 1454.02s]  Just, you're just giving an email to somebody.
[1454.02s -> 1454.90s]  And what are they gonna use it for?
[1454.90s -> 1456.74s]  Are they gonna tell you about beta testing?
[1456.74s -> 1458.42s]  They might.
[1458.42s -> 1463.13s]  It's not a bad analogy.
[1463.13s -> 1463.69s]  No, it's not.
[1464.63s -> 1466.39s]  Maybe you just write their full addresses and shit
[1466.39s -> 1467.75s]  and put it in that slot.
[1467.75s -> 1469.85s]  Your email address is your like on-
[1469.85s -> 1471.77s]  Your email address is your online address.
[1471.77s -> 1474.17s]  You don't want anybody to have that shit that you don't want.
[1474.17s -> 1477.11s]  That's why it's called email address.
[1477.11s -> 1479.03s]  It's your internet e-address.
[1479.03s -> 1481.18s]  No, it's not.
[1481.18s -> 1481.98s]  Yes, it is.
[1481.98s -> 1483.24s]  You gotta be careful.
[1483.24s -> 1484.28s]  Don't fuck around.
[1484.28s -> 1489.43s]  That's your IP.
[1489.43s -> 1489.91s]  No, it's not.
[1489.91s -> 1490.79s]  It's your email address.
[1491.51s -> 1495.94s]  The world as you know it is gone.
[1495.94s -> 1498.18s]  Human greed inevitably led to war.
[1498.18s -> 1500.39s]  After 10 years, the radiation settled down
[1500.39s -> 1503.43s]  enough for small groups of survivors to start coming out of their nuclear shelters.
[1503.99s -> 1507.10s]  You are the leader of one of them.
[1507.10s -> 1509.08s]  Okay.
[1509.08s -> 1512.23s]  Everything is ruined.
[1512.23s -> 1513.03s]  Resources seem gone.
[1513.03s -> 1515.19s]  But this must not be our end.
[1515.19s -> 1517.19s]  Explore and establish your settlement to survive.
[1517.19s -> 1518.07s]  Good luck.
[1518.07s -> 1521.66s]  Okay.
[1521.66s -> 1523.43s]  Starting boost.
[1523.43s -> 1524.79s]  Select your home continent.
[1524.79s -> 1525.94s]  Start in Africa.
[1525.94s -> 1529.37s]  Plus 30% faster builders suggested.
[1529.37s -> 1529.85s]  Australia.
[1529.85s -> 1531.13s]  Plus 20% mining rate.
[1531.13s -> 1531.45s]  Europe.
[1531.45s -> 1534.86s]  Plus 20% knowledge gain.
[1534.86s -> 1535.18s]  Asia.
[1535.18s -> 1536.38s]  Plus 30% citizen gain.
[1536.38s -> 1537.02s]  North America.
[1537.02s -> 1541.58s]  Plus 50% lower market spread.
[1541.58s -> 1542.38s]  Antarctica.
[1542.38s -> 1544.06s]  Plus 40% water gain.
[1547.37s -> 1550.54s]  Uh, the mining.
[1550.54s -> 1559.38s]  Let's do North America.
[1559.38s -> 1559.70s]  I don't know.
[1559.70s -> 1561.46s]  50% lower market spread.
[1561.46s -> 1562.62s]  Whatever.
[1562.62s -> 1563.82s]  Start exploring.
[1563.82s -> 1572.94s]  Get out of your shelter and start exploring for resources to survive the post-apocalyptic era.
[1572.94s -> 1576.54s]  Your group of survivors is small, but maybe you can find others.
[1576.54s -> 1578.94s]  Start by exploring the area around your shelter.
[1578.94s -> 1581.54s]  There have to be resources we can use around here.
[1581.54s -> 1582.74s]  I'm not nexting already.
[1582.74s -> 1582.98s]  What?
[1582.98s -> 1583.94s]  We did that already.
[1583.94s -> 1585.86s]  Start...
[1585.86s -> 1589.38s]  Assign some explorers.
[1589.38s -> 1589.78s]  Okay.
[1589.78s -> 1592.74s]  Assign some citizens to focus on exploring and look for resources.
[1592.74s -> 1594.47s]  And mom, don't next me yet.
[1594.47s -> 1595.11s]  I'm not ready.
[1595.35s -> 1598.02s]  Okay, so I want to put...
[1598.02s -> 1598.74s]  Assign explorers.
[1598.74s -> 1599.46s]  Okay, they're exploring.
[1603.19s -> 1604.87s]  Scavengers.
[1604.87s -> 1608.23s]  Assign citizens to start collecting food for your explorers.
[1608.23s -> 1609.27s]  Oh, this is cool.
[1609.27s -> 1610.58s]  It's just like a...
[1610.58s -> 1612.98s]  Everyone, you kind of spread people out to do different tasks and stuff.
[1612.98s -> 1613.62s]  It's an idle game.
[1613.62s -> 1613.86s]  I know.
[1613.86s -> 1614.34s]  All right.
[1614.34s -> 1615.43s]  Just let me...
[1615.43s -> 1615.99s]  Give me a minute.
[1615.99s -> 1617.74s]  Let me see how good it is.
[1617.74s -> 1619.10s]  And have one scavenger.
[1619.10s -> 1624.39s]  I'm seeing a lot of resident sleepers and it's really starting to make me self-conscious as a streamer.
[1624.95s -> 1627.03s]  Let's go with five scavengers.
[1627.03s -> 1633.64s]  It's making me look a little self-conscious.
[1633.64s -> 1634.84s]  Water and food are critical.
[1634.84s -> 1638.81s]  Drinking water.
[1638.81s -> 1640.25s]  Oh, um...
[1640.25s -> 1641.37s]  Okay, I guess...
[1641.37s -> 1648.98s]  You know when you get yourself in trouble here?
[1649.62s -> 1651.94s]  I was too lazy to type in armorgames.com.
[1651.94s -> 1654.26s]  I searched Armor Games.
[1654.26s -> 1656.74s]  Is Armor Games a safe website?
[1656.74s -> 1661.11s]  I couldn't just write armorgames.com.
[1661.11s -> 1661.59s]  No.
[1661.59s -> 1671.66s]  I had to search for it and then click on it.
[1671.66s -> 1674.54s]  That's lazy, but that's lazy for all the wrong reasons.
[1674.54s -> 1677.30s]  Because it's adding extra steps.
[1677.30s -> 1679.46s]  That's kind of bizarre.
[1679.46s -> 1683.00s]  Okay, what should I play?
[1683.00s -> 1684.20s]  What's this on the front page?
[1684.20s -> 1684.44s]  This is...
[1684.44s -> 1685.40s]  Oh wait, popular games.
[1685.40s -> 1686.12s]  Here we go.
[1688.10s -> 1688.90s]  Raid Heroes.
[1688.90s -> 1691.86s]  Total War.
[1691.86s -> 1692.50s]  Mob Wars.
[1692.50s -> 1694.02s]  Which one of these is actually, like, should I play?
[1694.58s -> 1698.26s]  This is not the only level.
[1698.26s -> 1699.06s]  This is not...
[1699.06s -> 1700.58s]  Please sort by god.
[1700.58s -> 1700.82s]  What?
[1702.09s -> 1703.05s]  Sort by god.
[1704.18s -> 1707.70s]  All games.
[1707.70s -> 1708.50s]  Action games.
[1708.50s -> 1712.84s]  Wait, hold on.
[1712.84s -> 1713.64s]  Adventure games.
[1714.28s -> 1715.96s]  There is no game.
[1715.96s -> 1726.28s]  Did we do that one?
[1726.28s -> 1726.60s]  Yes.
[1727.61s -> 1727.85s]  Okay.
[1728.95s -> 1731.83s]  If you like this non-game, go check out the Steam page.
[1731.83s -> 1733.35s]  What do you mean, Steam page?
[1733.35s -> 1739.70s]  Is this another one of those you sign up for the beta because there's a demo?
[1740.26s -> 1744.52s]  Better with audio.
[1746.14s -> 1754.31s]  Is this a crosshair?
[1754.31s -> 1755.43s]  Not a game.
[1755.43s -> 1757.82s]  By Kamizoto.
[1759.54s -> 1762.42s]  Probably not made with constructs.
[1764.50s -> 1766.66s]  There is no game.
[1766.66s -> 1776.97s]  I was feeling very leave.
[1776.97s -> 1778.09s]  There's no game.
[1778.09s -> 1781.62s]  So I hope you're not too much disappointed.
[1781.62s -> 1789.48s]  You can still watch TV, go outside, read a book, ask for refund.
[1790.44s -> 1793.75s]  And that game is free.
[1793.75s -> 1794.87s]  This is not a game.
[1795.51s -> 1797.43s]  It has nothing to do with the game.
[1798.15s -> 1800.95s]  It's just a massive package of boredom.
[1803.91s -> 1804.63s]  Okay, cool.
[1804.63s -> 1808.15s]  So I just sit here and let this guy give me comedy lines, right?
[1808.15s -> 1809.19s]  There's nothing to do in here.
[1809.19s -> 1811.08s]  Start clicking on stuff?
[1812.17s -> 1814.49s]  You can quit and leave me alone.
[1816.73s -> 1817.13s]  Sorry.
[1817.93s -> 1819.85s]  What have you done?
[1820.57s -> 1822.25s]  You've just ruined the title.
[1822.89s -> 1823.53s]  Put it back.
[1824.09s -> 1825.29s]  Put the latter back.
[1825.29s -> 1826.01s]  Okay.
[1826.01s -> 1826.25s]  No.
[1826.25s -> 1826.65s]  Come on.
[1828.01s -> 1829.29s]  I'm trying to put the letter back, dude.
[1830.49s -> 1831.29s]  Never mind.
[1831.29s -> 1833.53s]  I will fix it next time someone reloads the game.
[1834.65s -> 1835.29s]  Non-game.
[1836.65s -> 1837.53s]  No game here.
[1838.09s -> 1841.88s]  No game.
[1841.88s -> 1843.16s]  He said no game.
[1843.16s -> 1843.96s]  Click game.
[1843.96s -> 1844.76s]  No game.
[1844.76s -> 1855.11s]  Do I have to refresh the page?
[1855.11s -> 1856.15s]  Pop right.
[1856.15s -> 1860.76s]  Delete the Y.
[1860.76s -> 1861.00s]  What?
[1861.72s -> 1862.52s]  What is this?
[1863.16s -> 1864.70s]  I can't click it.
[1865.59s -> 1866.31s]  Use the O.
[1871.03s -> 1872.25s]  What?
[1872.25s -> 1873.05s]  Delete the A.
[1873.77s -> 1875.45s]  I can't do anything.
[1876.09s -> 1879.26s]  There is no game-o.
[1879.26s -> 1881.42s]  I don't know.
[1881.42s -> 1885.53s]  There-o-e-o is...
[1885.53s -> 1889.34s]  I don't know.
[1889.34s -> 1889.74s]  Duh.
[1890.38s -> 1891.10s]  What do I do?
[1892.22s -> 1892.70s]  Oh, shit.
[1892.70s -> 1895.88s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1895.88s -> 1896.60s]  Seriously.
[1896.60s -> 1901.02s]  Are you going to break everything?
[1901.02s -> 1901.82s]  I muted him.
[1901.82s -> 1906.01s]  That was horrible.
[1906.01s -> 1906.49s]  Finally.
[1906.49s -> 1907.37s]  Well, I get it.
[1907.37s -> 1913.06s]  You're trying to kill me.
[1913.06s -> 1914.74s]  Am I putting like a bag over his head?
[1917.14s -> 1918.74s]  As you love to click everywhere.
[1918.74s -> 1919.78s]  What do you think about that?
[1921.22s -> 1921.46s]  All right.
[1921.46s -> 1922.26s]  I have to crush him.
[1922.90s -> 1923.54s]  I can still get it.
[1925.14s -> 1928.71s]  Stop it now.
[1928.71s -> 1931.51s]  I think we're good.
[1931.51s -> 1932.23s]  Sorry.
[1932.23s -> 1935.75s]  I had to use the sort of procedures, but I had to.
[1936.55s -> 1937.51s]  I love the voice.
[1937.51s -> 1938.31s]  I love the accent.
[1938.31s -> 1940.55s]  He sounds like, oh, what's his name?
[1940.55s -> 1942.07s]  Oh, my God.
[1942.07s -> 1943.51s]  I'm trying to bring that one.
[1943.51s -> 1944.47s]  Oh, it's his name.
[1944.47s -> 1944.95s]  Peter.
[1944.95s -> 1945.91s]  Oh, Peter.
[1946.95s -> 1947.51s]  It's Peter.
[1947.51s -> 1948.31s]  What is it?
[1948.31s -> 1950.10s]  Peter.
[1950.10s -> 1951.86s]  Oh, he's in...
[1954.87s -> 1956.55s]  What's the game with the horror game?
[1957.45s -> 1957.93s]  Yes.
[1957.93s -> 1958.81s]  Stormer.
[1958.81s -> 1960.09s]  Peter Stormer.
[1960.09s -> 1962.14s]  I love that accent.
[1962.14s -> 1968.95s]  It's great.
[1968.95s -> 1972.02s]  You're a stubborn as a mule.
[1972.02s -> 1973.46s]  Call Superman for that one.
[1974.10s -> 1974.82s]  What's his name?
[1974.82s -> 1975.62s]  I don't know.
[1975.62s -> 1976.18s]  Stormer?
[1978.06s -> 1979.02s]  Stormerage.
[1979.02s -> 1979.66s]  Stormare?
[1980.74s -> 1983.78s]  I know Superman does not exist, but as we're in a game...
[1983.78s -> 1984.58s]  No, we're not.
[1985.46s -> 1987.59s]  The guy from Fargo?
[1988.63s -> 1989.35s]  You're still there.
[1989.35s -> 1989.91s]  Wait, what?
[1990.71s -> 1994.60s]  You're thinking about how to live that big days on you.
[1994.60s -> 1995.72s]  Check this shit out, guys.
[1996.52s -> 2003.56s]  Now you get audio cues as to how fast I can do that.
[2003.56s -> 2006.89s]  What was that?
[2006.89s -> 2007.45s]  What were they doing?
[2007.45s -> 2009.05s]  Oh, pick up the O and drop the O there.
[2014.86s -> 2015.90s]  Grab the E.
[2015.90s -> 2016.86s]  Grab the H.
[2016.86s -> 2020.28s]  It's going to be a screamer.
[2020.28s -> 2021.00s]  I don't think so.
[2021.56s -> 2024.92s]  It's a hit sound?
[2026.86s -> 2027.98s]  It kind of is, isn't it?
[2030.49s -> 2031.45s]  It is a hit sound.
[2037.05s -> 2039.37s]  Yeah, you have Pyro running around holding down the button.
[2040.66s -> 2042.74s]  You just turn the corner on Dust Bowl,
[2042.74s -> 2046.26s]  and you don't even care if you instantly explode.
[2046.26s -> 2047.86s]  The final point on Dust Bowl,
[2047.86s -> 2051.14s]  when there's like four engineers with four sentry guns pointing at you,
[2051.14s -> 2053.14s]  you just turn the last corner,
[2053.14s -> 2055.46s]  and even though you're dead in a half of a second,
[2055.46s -> 2056.98s]  you hold the button down and you hear this.
[2060.86s -> 2061.42s]  And then you hear...
[2067.78s -> 2069.54s]  You're like, yeah, yeah, you're still on fire.
[2069.54s -> 2070.82s]  Oh, you fucks.
[2070.82s -> 2075.53s]  Oh, shit.
[2075.53s -> 2076.81s]  Yes, yes, go on.
[2076.81s -> 2077.77s]  This is for my life.
[2078.78s -> 2079.98s]  What the mess?
[2079.98s -> 2081.02s]  These screws?
[2081.02s -> 2083.10s]  I hope you will clean the place before living.
[2087.13s -> 2090.49s]  Just what do you think you're doing, Yuzuru?
[2090.49s -> 2091.77s]  This is pretty cool.
[2091.77s -> 2092.89s]  There is a game.
[2092.89s -> 2094.01s]  Don't look.
[2094.01s -> 2095.29s]  It's private.
[2095.29s -> 2098.55s]  You're going to do a terrible mistake.
[2103.78s -> 2105.22s]  There is a game.
[2105.22s -> 2106.42s]  I can spell it.
[2106.42s -> 2114.54s]  Oh, cool.
[2115.26s -> 2117.51s]  This is one of my favorite games.
[2117.51s -> 2118.31s]  Breakout.
[2118.31s -> 2119.59s]  Don't play, it's forbidden.
[2120.15s -> 2122.07s]  If you play, they will come.
[2122.71s -> 2124.55s]  I don't want them to come.
[2124.55s -> 2125.11s]  What?
[2125.11s -> 2128.82s]  They can kill me, you know?
[2128.82s -> 2129.32s]  Please.
[2130.02s -> 2131.22s]  Oh, arrow keys.
[2131.22s -> 2131.86s]  How do I move?
[2131.86s -> 2140.52s]  Oh, bug snacks.
[2141.32s -> 2142.44s]  Bug snacks ending.
[2143.08s -> 2143.96s]  What do you mean?
[2144.04s -> 2144.68s]  There's a fun game.
[2144.68s -> 2144.92s]  What?
[2144.92s -> 2145.80s]  Oh, fuck.
[2145.80s -> 2149.00s]  I mean, nobody lists stuff.
[2149.00s -> 2149.96s]  Oh, shit.
[2151.90s -> 2153.58s]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[2153.58s -> 2154.06s]  What do I say?
[2154.06s -> 2155.98s]  What do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
[2155.98s -> 2157.10s]  What do I do, what do I do?
[2158.62s -> 2163.58s]  Bug snacks ending like when I ended the stream and I like fucking...
[2164.38s -> 2166.14s]  I like played Breakout at the end of that stream.
[2167.02s -> 2168.86s]  I must find a way to stop you.
[2168.86s -> 2171.58s]  No, there's no one talking about like a game ending.
[2171.58s -> 2172.70s]  Like any spoilers or anything.
[2173.77s -> 2174.81s]  I like ended the stream.
[2175.29s -> 2177.29s]  And I like went, fuck, I'll play Breakout, who cares?
[2181.75s -> 2182.47s]  Dude, without the ball.
[2183.03s -> 2185.51s]  That was a bad save.
[2185.51s -> 2186.07s]  Look, I'm...
[2186.07s -> 2187.11s]  No more ball.
[2187.11s -> 2187.67s]  Who cares?
[2190.86s -> 2192.78s]  Actually, I almost just dropped it.
[2192.78s -> 2193.90s]  Leave now, please.
[2194.62s -> 2198.97s]  I don't feel well.
[2198.97s -> 2200.17s]  What was he talking about?
[2200.17s -> 2201.77s]  I'm going to be sick.
[2201.77s -> 2203.77s]  We just like kind of spoiled the end of bug snacks.
[2203.77s -> 2206.33s]  So I just desperately tried to pretend like we did.
[2207.21s -> 2209.13s]  The one person that doesn't think that we did.
[2210.54s -> 2211.10s]  Oh, no.
[2212.30s -> 2213.10s]  They're here.
[2214.79s -> 2215.75s]  Glitches.
[2215.75s -> 2216.63s]  He said, we.
[2216.63s -> 2218.07s]  Well, somebody did.
[2218.07s -> 2219.43s]  And then I just read it because I'm stupid.
[2219.99s -> 2221.51s]  I told you to stop.
[2222.31s -> 2223.98s]  You must find a way to get rid of them.
[2223.98s -> 2226.06s]  How is this even remotely like that, by the way?
[2226.70s -> 2227.34s]  How is it...
[2227.34s -> 2228.06s]  This doesn't make any sense.
[2228.06s -> 2230.78s]  How can I become self-success with all the glitches?
[2231.82s -> 2234.14s]  Think, think, think.
[2234.14s -> 2237.34s]  What the developer will implement will sell a bugged creation.
[2237.34s -> 2238.14s]  I'm not talking about spoilers.
[2238.14s -> 2239.50s]  I see three possible things.
[2240.22s -> 2242.38s]  Gorgeous armed hero girls.
[2243.10s -> 2246.30s]  Or a ton of zombies and brood, of course.
[2247.02s -> 2250.06s]  Or a goat.
[2250.06s -> 2251.02s]  Cyberfunk is out.
[2251.02s -> 2253.02s]  I know, but try to find one of these three things.
[2254.38s -> 2256.39s]  OK, so we have to find...
[2257.35s -> 2259.56s]  Does it find a goat?
[2260.44s -> 2266.12s]  Perhaps the letters can help us.
[2268.42s -> 2269.62s]  There is a goat.
[2277.13s -> 2278.41s]  Sexy girls and zombies.
[2278.41s -> 2280.97s]  OK, it's attractive in a way.
[2280.97s -> 2282.49s]  All right, well, well, we got to go now, all right?
[2283.53s -> 2285.05s]  Obviously, the cage is locked.
[2285.61s -> 2286.89s]  You must find the key.
[2286.89s -> 2287.61s]  All right, we need a key.
[2289.43s -> 2290.79s]  Key, key, key, key, key.
[2291.67s -> 2292.39s]  Can I spell key?
[2293.43s -> 2293.99s]  Key!
[2293.99s -> 2294.31s]  Get it!
[2295.11s -> 2295.83s]  Hey!
[2295.83s -> 2297.91s]  That flying squirrel took it.
[2297.91s -> 2298.87s]  You must get it back.
[2299.51s -> 2302.23s]  Find a ladder or something to go up.
[2302.23s -> 2302.71s]  Something to go up.
[2302.71s -> 2304.23s]  Something you can climb.
[2304.23s -> 2304.79s]  What can I climb?
[2304.79s -> 2305.43s]  What can I climb?
[2305.43s -> 2307.59s]  That reminds me of my childhood.
[2307.59s -> 2308.15s]  Can I spell it?
[2308.15s -> 2311.43s]  You used to climb a huge tree in the garden to get back my kite.
[2312.47s -> 2313.19s]  Yes, I know what you're trying to do.
[2313.19s -> 2313.75s]  Climb a tree?
[2314.71s -> 2318.06s]  Climb a waterfall?
[2318.06s -> 2319.50s]  Well, this is a small tree.
[2320.50s -> 2322.18s]  And finally, it was bigger.
[2322.18s -> 2322.98s]  How do I get a big tree?
[2322.98s -> 2323.86s]  All right, I'm going to take it over here.
[2324.74s -> 2325.86s]  Can I bring water over here?
[2327.14s -> 2331.48s]  There's water here.
[2331.48s -> 2332.84s]  All right, I need to bring the water over here.
[2332.84s -> 2334.76s]  How can you bring water to that tree?
[2334.76s -> 2335.26s]  Bucket.
[2335.88s -> 2336.60s]  Bucket.
[2336.60s -> 2337.96s]  A container.
[2339.02s -> 2341.02s]  A box.
[2350.71s -> 2356.22s]  I'm going to bring water over here.
[2356.22s -> 2357.11s]  I need a bucket.
[2359.96s -> 2361.00s]  The rope?
[2361.08s -> 2362.36s]  That's five letters, man.
[2362.92s -> 2366.36s]  Yeah, I'm going to drink it, and I'm going to come back over and regurgitate it into the tree.
[2367.00s -> 2367.80s]  I need to see the words.
[2367.80s -> 2368.44s]  Let me see the letters.
[2371.34s -> 2383.37s]  I'm more water.
[2383.37s -> 2384.17s]  Trophy.
[2384.17s -> 2384.81s]  Read chat.
[2384.81s -> 2385.37s]  The trophy.
[2389.85s -> 2400.41s]  Oh, oops.
[2402.38s -> 2403.34s]  Backseaters.
[2403.34s -> 2403.58s]  What?
[2403.58s -> 2404.78s]  I didn't know it was actually...
[2404.78s -> 2405.74s]  Okay, whatever.
[2405.74s -> 2406.30s]  Give me some more.
[2409.98s -> 2411.30s]  Keep going.
[2411.30s -> 2411.62s]  More.
[2414.10s -> 2414.82s]  Save the goat.
[2415.22s -> 2415.70s]  I'm...
[2415.70s -> 2416.10s]  I'm...
[2416.10s -> 2417.06s]  That's what I'm trying to do, isn't it?
[2417.06s -> 2417.70s]  Trying to save the goat.
[2418.74s -> 2420.36s]  We fucking finally did it.
[2421.94s -> 2422.58s]  Hey, I...
[2422.58s -> 2422.90s]  This is...
[2423.54s -> 2424.62s]  Give me that key.
[2425.42s -> 2430.97s]  And then you go over to your friend's house, and they have a fucking really annoying hit sound,
[2430.97s -> 2433.37s]  and you just have to play on their terrible hit sound,
[2433.37s -> 2434.97s]  and they think it's funny, but you think it's annoying.
[2435.93s -> 2447.70s]  Can I go even higher?
[2447.70s -> 2448.50s]  All right, I need to take that...
[2448.50s -> 2449.70s]  What does a squirrel like?
[2449.70s -> 2450.02s]  Nuts.
[2451.56s -> 2452.28s]  Uh, nuts.
[2452.28s -> 2453.72s]  I kind of smell nuts.
[2453.72s -> 2458.04s]  Does it go even higher?
[2459.67s -> 2460.55s]  No, I don't have to go higher.
[2461.80s -> 2462.76s]  It's nuts, but there's no N.
[2463.40s -> 2467.66s]  Can I get a nut somewhere?
[2470.10s -> 2470.42s]  Nut.
[2472.46s -> 2473.02s]  Uh...
[2473.02s -> 2473.98s]  No, I need water.
[2473.98s -> 2474.54s]  I need a nut.
[2475.26s -> 2481.43s]  I dropped the...
[2481.43s -> 2482.71s]  I dropped the safe on his head?
[2482.71s -> 2483.35s]  Why would I do that?
[2483.35s -> 2484.15s]  That's, like, terrible.
[2485.03s -> 2491.56s]  Can I pick...
[2491.56s -> 2492.20s]  Can I move this?
[2493.93s -> 2494.41s]  Is it in...
[2494.41s -> 2495.21s]  It's in the tree.
[2495.85s -> 2497.46s]  Is it?
[2497.46s -> 2501.75s]  Got it.
[2506.78s -> 2507.42s]  Shit.
[2507.42s -> 2507.82s]  Come here.
[2508.46s -> 2511.98s]  I have to break it?
[2511.98s -> 2512.46s]  Oh.
[2512.46s -> 2513.02s]  All right, wait, wait.
[2513.02s -> 2514.62s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[2515.18s -> 2516.98s]  Give me that.
[2517.62s -> 2524.57s]  All right, I got the key.
[2524.57s -> 2525.05s]  Save the goat.
[2531.77s -> 2532.65s]  Save the goat.
[2532.65s -> 2533.29s]  Save the world.
[2533.93s -> 2534.17s]  Open.
[2536.07s -> 2537.27s]  He fucking exploded.
[2537.27s -> 2537.99s]  No!
[2537.99s -> 2542.82s]  The goat, it's getting worse.
[2542.82s -> 2543.86s]  Goat was a lie.
[2543.86s -> 2544.82s]  Oh, gracious.
[2547.78s -> 2555.27s]  Now what?
[2558.50s -> 2562.47s]  It was wrong.
[2562.47s -> 2563.67s]  It was a bad idea.
[2564.70s -> 2565.82s]  Everything disappeared.
[2566.46s -> 2567.34s]  Except me.
[2568.14s -> 2569.69s]  How old is this game?
[2569.69s -> 2570.17s]  I don't know.
[2570.17s -> 2571.13s]  Probably a lot...
[2571.13s -> 2572.25s]  Pretty old.
[2572.25s -> 2574.18s]  It's all my fault.
[2574.18s -> 2576.10s]  Please, will you forgive me?
[2584.60s -> 2585.32s]  Oh, there it is.
[2585.32s -> 2585.72s]  All right.
[2586.20s -> 2586.68s]  That was called...
[2587.64s -> 2588.76s]  There is no game.
[2589.82s -> 2591.42s]  Now should I play there is only one level?
[2592.38s -> 2594.57s]  Wait, what did that say?
[2596.06s -> 2596.46s]  World...
[2597.10s -> 2600.38s]  One billion off debt if he gets world record speedrun in any of these games.
[2600.38s -> 2601.10s]  That's not gonna happen.
[2601.90s -> 2602.79s]  All right.
[2602.79s -> 2604.15s]  Now play there is only one level.
[2604.15s -> 2606.07s]  So first there was no game.
[2606.07s -> 2607.19s]  But now there's one level.
[2609.59s -> 2609.83s]  Okay.
[2610.39s -> 2612.87s]  Is it on here?
[2615.14s -> 2617.62s]  Oh, I played the absolute hell out of this on iPad.
[2619.03s -> 2621.03s]  I like almost 100% at this game.
[2621.03s -> 2621.91s]  Like a year or two ago.
[2622.71s -> 2624.06s]  Is it on here?
[2624.06s -> 2628.57s]  It's called...
[2628.57s -> 2629.85s]  There is only one level.
[2630.41s -> 2634.47s]  Just search for it.
[2636.82s -> 2637.30s]  Okay.
[2637.30s -> 2639.96s]  There is a bomb.
[2642.31s -> 2643.99s]  I don't think it's on armor games.
[2648.70s -> 2650.30s]  This is the only...
[2650.30s -> 2653.11s]  This is a work of fiction.
[2653.99s -> 2655.51s]  This is the only level.
[2655.51s -> 2655.99s]  This...
[2655.99s -> 2656.63s]  Four of these.
[2656.63s -> 2657.11s]  This is...
[2657.11s -> 2659.03s]  This five of these games.
[2659.03s -> 2661.98s]  This is the only level.
[2663.24s -> 2664.52s]  This game requires flash.
[2664.52s -> 2665.72s]  Flash is blocked.
[2666.60s -> 2668.47s]  Fuck.
[2668.47s -> 2668.95s]  Does it?
[2668.95s -> 2669.83s]  It looks like it's loading.
[2673.16s -> 2673.40s]  Oh.
[2678.42s -> 2679.22s]  Well, hold on.
[2681.46s -> 2682.82s]  Yeah, by the way, the reason why we're doing this
[2682.82s -> 2684.26s]  is because in like two or three weeks,
[2684.26s -> 2686.74s]  flash is literally going to be deleted from the internet.
[2686.74s -> 2690.01s]  It's a nice flash games.
[2690.01s -> 2690.41s]  Hold on.
[2692.97s -> 2693.53s]  Let me do this.
[2694.98s -> 2695.46s]  Go into...
[2696.66s -> 2697.86s]  Go into settings.
[2697.86s -> 2698.34s]  Should I do this?
[2698.34s -> 2698.82s]  This is bad.
[2700.95s -> 2701.51s]  Settings.
[2701.51s -> 2702.23s]  Site settings.
[2702.23s -> 2702.63s]  Flash.
[2705.08s -> 2705.96s]  Site settings.
[2706.52s -> 2709.22s]  I don't think...
[2709.22s -> 2710.90s]  Isn't it highly recommended not to do this?
[2711.54s -> 2719.38s]  Not yet.
[2719.38s -> 2719.70s]  Okay.
[2721.30s -> 2722.02s]  Site settings.
[2723.42s -> 2724.14s]  Uh...
[2724.14s -> 2724.70s]  Flash.
[2724.70s -> 2726.94s]  Block sites from using flash.
[2726.94s -> 2728.22s]  Okay, we're going to allow.
[2731.98s -> 2733.58s]  Ask first is what it says.
[2735.42s -> 2739.72s]  I can't even allow it.
[2739.72s -> 2741.24s]  I have to do ask first.
[2741.96s -> 2746.92s]  Okay.
[2746.92s -> 2748.60s]  Well, let's have to reboot it.
[2749.24s -> 2753.66s]  Okay.
[2753.66s -> 2755.26s]  Run flash this time.
[2755.26s -> 2755.50s]  Okay.
[2756.30s -> 2758.38s]  Did it work?
[2761.05s -> 2761.69s]  I don't think it did.
[2762.71s -> 2763.51s]  Oh shit.
[2763.51s -> 2763.99s]  What happened?
[2764.63s -> 2766.31s]  What happened?
[2766.31s -> 2766.71s]  Already?
[2766.71s -> 2767.83s]  Did I get hacked already?
[2767.83s -> 2768.39s]  What happened?
[2768.95s -> 2773.85s]  I turned...
[2773.85s -> 2776.17s]  I turned on flash and I get a notification.
[2776.17s -> 2777.77s]  They really don't want you to turn this on.
[2778.73s -> 2780.97s]  They desperately do not want you to turn this on.
[2782.01s -> 2783.45s]  Flash player will no longer be supported.
[2783.45s -> 2784.01s]  Turn it off.
[2788.41s -> 2789.45s]  Holy shit, man.
[2790.01s -> 2792.78s]  Can you see?
[2801.96s -> 2803.48s]  How come I can't capture the window now?
[2808.01s -> 2808.41s]  Oh, okay.
[2808.41s -> 2808.97s]  There we go.
[2808.97s -> 2809.53s]  That was weird.
[2812.86s -> 2813.58s]  Okay.
[2813.58s -> 2814.06s]  All right.
[2814.06s -> 2816.22s]  So this is the only level.
[2816.94s -> 2818.65s]  This game...
[2818.65s -> 2819.53s]  Flash is blocked.
[2820.60s -> 2821.16s]  It's not.
[2821.16s -> 2822.04s]  I just unblocked it.
[2824.95s -> 2825.91s]  I don't think I can play this.
[2841.40s -> 2842.04s]  Click it.
[2842.68s -> 2843.08s]  Click.
[2844.33s -> 2844.97s]  I...
[2844.97s -> 2846.09s]  Look, I don't use...
[2846.09s -> 2847.45s]  I never really use Chrome.
[2848.17s -> 2849.37s]  I'm a Firefox guy.
[2850.01s -> 2852.02s]  There's only one level.
[2852.02s -> 2852.58s]  Okay, play it.
[2853.14s -> 2857.54s]  That's based...
[2857.54s -> 2858.18s]  Of course it is.
[2859.19s -> 2860.07s]  Why would you use Chrome?
[2860.07s -> 2861.75s]  It uses like 40% CPU.
[2862.63s -> 2865.43s]  Mozilla's got like quantum tech...
[2865.43s -> 2868.07s]  Mozilla has quantum technology.
[2868.07s -> 2869.11s]  I've read that.
[2869.11s -> 2871.99s]  Did you read that about Mozilla quantum?
[2871.99s -> 2873.27s]  Firefox quantum?
[2876.46s -> 2878.38s]  Yes, I'm aware that that's just like
[2878.38s -> 2881.26s]  infomercial speak of like new and improved.
[2882.14s -> 2883.42s]  It's just soap and water.
[2883.42s -> 2883.98s]  I know.
[2883.98s -> 2886.06s]  But like they say, the new technology.
[2886.06s -> 2887.82s]  The new soap bubble technology.
[2888.46s -> 2888.94s]  I get it.
[2890.81s -> 2892.17s]  Play or continue level one.
[2893.80s -> 2895.24s]  I have a web timer?
[2895.24s -> 2895.80s]  Hold on.
[2895.80s -> 2896.60s]  I gotta zoom this in.
[2897.48s -> 2901.21s]  Why do I feel like I've played this game before?
[2901.21s -> 2906.68s]  Does the timer matter?
[2907.24s -> 2913.56s]  Okay.
[2915.03s -> 2915.67s]  Arrow keys.
[2916.39s -> 2923.54s]  All right.
[2923.54s -> 2924.26s]  Stage complete.
[2924.26s -> 2925.70s]  But this is the level over.
[2929.40s -> 2929.80s]  Okay.
[2929.80s -> 2931.64s]  So they made my controls backwards.
[2931.64s -> 2933.88s]  I remember this game from like 2001.
[2936.41s -> 2937.69s]  Think before doing.
[2937.69s -> 2938.65s]  I remember this game.
[2938.65s -> 2940.73s]  This is one of those original like troll games.
[2947.66s -> 2948.86s]  Alternate control scheme.
[2951.82s -> 2952.32s]  What?
[2958.34s -> 2958.84s]  Mouse?
[2959.30s -> 2959.80s]  Oh, okay.
[2960.34s -> 2963.62s]  Get in.
[2963.62s -> 2966.66s]  This is like the impossible quiz
[2966.66s -> 2969.14s]  where you had to memorize every single answer.
[2972.54s -> 2973.42s]  Free floating.
[2974.06s -> 2980.25s]  It's a legendary game.
[2980.25s -> 2981.29s]  Yeah, it's a bit bouncy.
[2982.09s -> 2983.06s]  But okay.
[2983.06s -> 2983.56s]  I get it.
[2984.34s -> 2991.18s]  This is not like the impossible quiz.
[2991.18s -> 2992.78s]  Yeah, but it was the same time frame.
[2993.42s -> 2994.22s]  Wait, I can jump?
[2995.02s -> 2995.52s]  Oh.
[2995.90s -> 2998.50s]  These all came out like around the same time.
[2999.22s -> 3002.52s]  With the impossible quiz today.
[3002.52s -> 3003.40s]  You know what's really funny?
[3004.12s -> 3005.72s]  I probably have still...
[3005.72s -> 3007.56s]  I played that game so often when I was younger.
[3007.56s -> 3009.40s]  I think I probably have memorized
[3009.40s -> 3010.44s]  a shitload of those answers.
[3012.73s -> 3014.01s]  Handy stripes of doom.
[3014.65s -> 3017.22s]  Okay, so don't touch pink.
[3017.22s -> 3018.10s]  Okay, don't touch pink.
[3018.90s -> 3019.86s]  How do I...
[3025.42s -> 3026.06s]  Oh, fuck.
[3026.06s -> 3026.38s]  Hold on.
[3026.94s -> 3028.38s]  How am I supposed to...
[3028.38s -> 3028.94s]  How do I get up there?
[3029.58s -> 3035.75s]  A hundred million off the dead
[3035.75s -> 3036.95s]  if you can do the impossible quiz.
[3038.70s -> 3041.18s]  I think I remember most of the answers.
[3046.55s -> 3047.51s]  Arrow control?
[3048.23s -> 3050.41s]  Oh, shit.
[3050.41s -> 3050.91s]  Hold on.
[3057.78s -> 3058.98s]  You know when you go to your friend's house
[3058.98s -> 3059.94s]  and they've got a fucking crazy...
[3059.94s -> 3060.42s]  He hits it out.
[3067.78s -> 3068.58s]  Okay, then do it.
[3068.58s -> 3069.14s]  I have to click.
[3074.46s -> 3076.92s]  Heavy headwind here.
[3077.64s -> 3081.24s]  Look at how fun this is.
[3081.96s -> 3082.60s]  Remember when...
[3082.60s -> 3083.96s]  Oh, dude, remember when video games
[3083.96s -> 3084.92s]  were so much better?
[3085.64s -> 3088.62s]  So much time and passion went into it.
[3089.42s -> 3097.58s]  This ain't even boomer.
[3097.58s -> 3098.14s]  What are you talking about?
[3098.14s -> 3099.98s]  This is millennial.
[3099.98s -> 3102.34s]  This game came out when I was probably 14.
[3102.98s -> 3103.62s]  15 or something.
[3104.42s -> 3111.43s]  Got a raid?
[3111.99s -> 3112.86s]  We're raided.
[3113.34s -> 3114.25s]  We're raided.
[3114.25s -> 3114.65s]  We got a raid?
[3114.65s -> 3115.29s]  Did we get a raid?
[3116.23s -> 3117.03s]  Oh, shit.
[3117.03s -> 3118.31s]  It's Kit Vogan.
[3119.35s -> 3120.31s]  Kit Vogan raid.
[3121.34s -> 3123.50s]  I got to sing the raid song.
[3127.34s -> 3127.84s]  Hey.
[3128.92s -> 3130.36s]  Thank you for the raid.
[3131.16s -> 3133.24s]  Well, I'm doing it to this song in the background.
[3137.03s -> 3137.83s]  Thanks, Kit.
[3137.83s -> 3139.03s]  I hope you had a good stream today.
[3141.72s -> 3142.76s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[3143.99s -> 3144.71s]  Welcome everybody.
[3145.27s -> 3147.00s]  We're currently just doing flash games
[3147.00s -> 3147.96s]  and chilling for a little bit.
[3152.10s -> 3155.06s]  I actually saw a pretty funny Kit Vogan clip recently
[3155.06s -> 3158.58s]  and when he was talking to a scammer
[3158.58s -> 3160.18s]  that didn't believe he was him.
[3160.98s -> 3162.15s]  This scammer was like,
[3162.15s -> 3163.67s]  yeah, I'm a big fan of Kit Vogan.
[3163.67s -> 3164.23s]  It's not you.
[3165.11s -> 3165.91s]  He's like, okay.
[3167.67s -> 3169.59s]  He's like, maybe one day you'll get to talk to him.
[3170.15s -> 3172.15s]  And the guy's like, yeah, maybe.
[3172.15s -> 3173.11s]  It's not you, though.
[3173.83s -> 3179.05s]  But welcome, guys.
[3179.69s -> 3180.63s]  Thanks for the raid.
[3182.17s -> 3183.61s]  One, I could only jump once.
[3185.16s -> 3186.52s]  Yeah, we're currently playing games that,
[3186.52s -> 3187.88s]  you know, you look back and you go like, man.
[3189.08s -> 3191.00s]  Back when people made games like Passion,
[3191.72s -> 3196.81s]  like Super Mario, Super Mario 2, Super Mario 3.
[3197.77s -> 3199.21s]  The impossible game.
[3199.93s -> 3201.54s]  Time to refresh.
[3202.26s -> 3215.03s]  I mean, what?
[3215.03s -> 3223.54s]  I have to actually hit F5?
[3224.34s -> 3225.34s]  No, you don't.
[3225.90s -> 3227.59s]  But is it going to count though?
[3227.59s -> 3229.35s]  Because Flash Player is like dead and broken.
[3229.35s -> 3229.99s]  Will it remember?
[3240.58s -> 3244.98s]  Uh, okay.
[3247.53s -> 3249.77s]  Welcome to the channel.
[3249.77s -> 3253.53s]  Thank you Kit Vogan for that sweet ass raid.
[3260.63s -> 3263.24s]  That was a bad one.
[3263.24s -> 3263.96s]  That was a good one,
[3263.96s -> 3265.24s]  but it was a bad one at the same time.
[3265.24s -> 3268.04s]  Why am I at level one?
[3271.61s -> 3273.37s]  I was like, that was yikes.
[3274.58s -> 3276.26s]  Oh, what happened?
[3276.26s -> 3276.98s]  Did I get baited?
[3281.10s -> 3283.18s]  Oh, for that sweet ass raid.
[3283.90s -> 3289.34s]  No, I don't want to do this whole thing again.
[3289.34s -> 3290.14s]  Did I get fooled?
[3291.50s -> 3292.70s]  Do an impossible quiz.
[3292.70s -> 3293.82s]  No, let me get past that.
[3293.82s -> 3294.54s]  Let me do this first.
[3294.54s -> 3295.10s]  I'll do this quick.
[3295.10s -> 3295.82s]  Think before doing.
[3300.34s -> 3301.30s]  Turn on cookies.
[3301.86s -> 3306.92s]  Am I going to turn cookies on?
[3307.56s -> 3314.14s]  Possible quiz.
[3314.14s -> 3315.98s]  I will do the impossible quiz, I promise.
[3315.98s -> 3317.50s]  By the end of the stream today,
[3317.50s -> 3320.30s]  I will have completed the impossible quiz.
[3321.40s -> 3323.94s]  Okay, you understand?
[3325.80s -> 3327.64s]  At least, hold on, let me make this.
[3327.64s -> 3329.56s]  I know people are calling me a liar and that's fine.
[3329.56s -> 3333.34s]  At least the first 50 levels, okay?
[3334.06s -> 3335.90s]  I will get to level 50.
[3338.68s -> 3340.28s]  I know there's like 125 levels,
[3340.28s -> 3341.88s]  but I'll get to at least level 50.
[3346.82s -> 3348.02s]  Moving a goal post, that's fine.
[3348.02s -> 3349.22s]  I'll continue to do so.
[3349.22s -> 3352.26s]  What's that singing?
[3359.02s -> 3362.23s]  You said you'd beat it.
[3362.23s -> 3365.22s]  Oh, come on.
[3365.22s -> 3365.78s]  What the fuck?
[3374.14s -> 3374.78s]  I'm going to...
[3374.78s -> 3375.90s]  This is all going on YouTube, guys.
[3376.54s -> 3382.41s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[3385.08s -> 3387.40s]  And then what's going to happen is whenever I do...
[3387.40s -> 3389.08s]  Whenever I get really close to dying,
[3389.08s -> 3390.84s]  the camera is going to zoom the fuck in
[3390.84s -> 3391.96s]  right at when I fall down, right there.
[3391.96s -> 3392.92s]  It's like a one second cut.
[3394.04s -> 3395.64s]  Like, no, no, no, no, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[3396.20s -> 3396.44s]  No.
[3397.40s -> 3398.12s]  Oh, I mean...
[3398.84s -> 3399.24s]  No.
[3399.24s -> 3400.04s]  Oh, there we go.
[3400.60s -> 3401.96s]  It's going to zoom, wick-a-ding, wick-a-close.
[3402.60s -> 3403.96s]  And it's going to zoom, wick-a-close to my face.
[3403.96s -> 3404.68s]  I'm going to be going like this.
[3406.46s -> 3407.18s]  I don't...
[3407.18s -> 3407.90s]  Don't use that.
[3408.54s -> 3425.94s]  Perfect dog cam today.
[3435.08s -> 3436.04s]  Air pet him, all right.
[3436.60s -> 3440.78s]  Otto!
[3440.78s -> 3442.42s]  Otto!
[3442.42s -> 3444.89s]  Who's a good dog, Otto?
[3448.15s -> 3448.55s]  Move.
[3448.55s -> 3449.11s]  I'm...
[3449.11s -> 3449.75s]  How's my hair?
[3457.46s -> 3462.20s]  It's there.
[3471.21s -> 3472.01s]  It's there.
[3474.01s -> 3476.97s]  You've got to press it on you.
[3478.09s -> 3482.89s]  I guess again that's what you do, baby.
[3483.77s -> 3486.06s]  Hold it down.
[3486.06s -> 3486.56s]  There.
[3495.32s -> 3497.40s]  In DMCA me, well, that means I did a good job.
[3497.40s -> 3497.88s]  So go ahead.
[3507.78s -> 3508.58s]  It's there.
[3509.22s -> 3510.63s]  It's a great song.
[3519.98s -> 3522.38s]  No returns, no refunds.
[3522.38s -> 3526.65s]  It's coming up.
[3526.65s -> 3527.61s]  It's coming up.
[3527.61s -> 3528.57s]  It's coming up.
[3528.57s -> 3529.77s]  It's coming up.
[3529.77s -> 3530.65s]  It's there.
[3531.53s -> 3535.02s]  Left, right, march.
[3547.08s -> 3548.68s]  I actually haven't heard the new Gorillaz album.
[3548.68s -> 3549.16s]  I really haven't.
[3549.80s -> 3553.24s]  It's kind of bad.
[3553.80s -> 3554.92s]  I love that, man.
[3554.92s -> 3556.12s]  Stop playing this trash.
[3556.12s -> 3556.60s]  I will.
[3556.60s -> 3557.64s]  Okay, time to refresh.
[3558.52s -> 3560.76s]  Why though?
[3560.76s -> 3561.56s]  Why is it doing this?
[3562.28s -> 3566.41s]  Enter refresh.
[3567.05s -> 3568.33s]  I'm not pressing F5 again.
[3568.97s -> 3571.02s]  You have to enable cookies.
[3571.66s -> 3571.98s]  Is that...
[3572.78s -> 3574.84s]  Cookies are enabled.
[3575.48s -> 3583.83s]  Turn on cookies and refresh.
[3583.83s -> 3584.55s]  They're on.
[3585.27s -> 3588.63s]  All right.
[3588.63s -> 3589.19s]  Give me the...
[3589.19s -> 3589.51s]  Let's go.
[3589.51s -> 3590.47s]  I'm doing impossible quiz.
[3590.47s -> 3591.51s]  That one was fun.
[3591.51s -> 3595.64s]  Impossible ball.
[3595.64s -> 3596.28s]  Well, that's not it.
[3596.28s -> 3597.08s]  Where's impossible quiz?
[3597.08s -> 3597.88s]  Is it on congregate?
[3602.79s -> 3603.19s]  Oh, there it is.
[3603.19s -> 3604.07s]  Impossible quiz.
[3604.95s -> 3606.15s]  Wait, impossible game?
[3606.79s -> 3613.88s]  Enabling flash.
[3613.88s -> 3614.36s]  Hello, players.
[3614.36s -> 3616.52s]  The latest version of Chrome includes enhanced security.
[3616.52s -> 3618.20s]  It must be configured to allow flash.
[3618.76s -> 3619.48s]  Oh, God.
[3620.12s -> 3621.86s]  Okay.
[3621.86s -> 3625.14s]  Use the supernova plugin as an easy way to enable.
[3626.10s -> 3627.38s]  It's already installed, isn't it?
[3627.46s -> 3628.66s]  Go get flash player.
[3629.30s -> 3632.14s]  Do it.
[3632.14s -> 3632.70s]  Click the link.
[3632.70s -> 3633.26s]  I'm afraid.
[3633.26s -> 3633.90s]  I'm like afraid.
[3634.62s -> 3636.81s]  I'm afraid to click the link.
[3636.81s -> 3637.45s]  I don't think I'm...
[3637.45s -> 3637.93s]  Hold on.
[3637.93s -> 3638.43s]  What's this?
[3642.87s -> 3643.91s]  Zorn lovers?
[3643.91s -> 3645.19s]  I'm only five miles away.
[3649.48s -> 3649.64s]  All right.
[3649.64s -> 3651.24s]  It took me a second to realize what this was.
[3651.24s -> 3652.68s]  And then it was very funny.
[3655.08s -> 3660.94s]  Hold on.
[3660.94s -> 3661.42s]  Let's get it.
[3673.82s -> 3674.06s]  Okay.
[3674.06s -> 3675.34s]  We're going to enable it, I guess.
[3675.34s -> 3675.98s]  Is it going to work?
[3676.54s -> 3682.09s]  I think it worked.
[3682.09s -> 3682.65s]  Did it work?
[3683.21s -> 3685.26s]  It's not loading it though.
[3685.90s -> 3691.06s]  It's blank.
[3691.06s -> 3692.62s]  Hold on.
[3692.62s -> 3693.42s]  Let me try to refresh.
[3694.78s -> 3695.26s]  Refresh.
[3695.90s -> 3699.48s]  Come on.
[3699.48s -> 3702.81s]  Is there another one?
[3702.81s -> 3702.97s]  Wait.
[3702.97s -> 3703.53s]  There's another one.
[3703.53s -> 3704.81s]  Impossible quiz dot...
[3704.81s -> 3705.69s]  Is that a good one?
[3706.25s -> 3707.13s]  Is this a real website?
[3707.13s -> 3708.65s]  Or did you just fucking type this in and make it up?
[3711.56s -> 3712.60s]  Oh, this feels like a fake.
[3712.60s -> 3714.04s]  This doesn't feel like a real website to me.
[3714.76s -> 3718.39s]  It's real.
[3718.39s -> 3718.79s]  It's real.
[3718.79s -> 3718.95s]  Okay.
[3718.95s -> 3719.59s]  All right.
[3719.59s -> 3720.87s]  This website uses cookies.
[3720.87s -> 3721.27s]  Eat them.
[3729.08s -> 3730.36s]  I'm five miles away.
[3730.36s -> 3731.48s]  I love to chat.
[3732.28s -> 3737.27s]  Can I get rid of these ads though?
[3737.27s -> 3737.99s]  Like really?
[3738.71s -> 3742.86s]  What the fuck just happened?
[3744.06s -> 3745.34s]  I just clicked an ad.
[3745.90s -> 3746.70s]  This was an ad.
[3752.98s -> 3753.62s]  You suck.
[3754.18s -> 3756.66s]  The game's taking impossibly long to load, but it'll be worth it.
[3756.66s -> 3757.86s]  Oh, it's part of the joke.
[3760.42s -> 3761.22s]  What the fuck?
[3761.22s -> 3762.50s]  I just clicked the ad again.
[3769.99s -> 3770.47s]  Hurry up.
[3771.35s -> 3771.83s]  I want to get...
[3771.83s -> 3772.23s]  Hold on.
[3772.23s -> 3772.79s]  Get rid of this.
[3772.79s -> 3773.75s]  I'm not going to let this...
[3773.75s -> 3774.71s]  I'm not going to stand for this.
[3776.12s -> 3776.68s]  I'm not going to...
[3776.68s -> 3777.72s]  I'm not going to stand for this.
[3778.92s -> 3779.32s]  I'm sorry.
[3779.32s -> 3780.52s]  That's not going to happen.
[3780.52s -> 3785.38s]  Wait a minute.
[3785.38s -> 3786.26s]  What's that slot machine?
[3793.50s -> 3795.22s]  Okay.
[3795.22s -> 3797.22s]  Oh my fucking god, Jeremy.
[3797.78s -> 3799.62s]  I just gave this website...
[3799.62s -> 3801.54s]  Like why is this doing this?
[3810.04s -> 3811.32s]  Play the Zorn game.
[3811.32s -> 3812.84s]  I'm on the impossible quiz.
[3812.84s -> 3813.88s]  Why is this doing this?
[3820.22s -> 3821.66s]  I didn't even click anything.
[3821.66s -> 3822.86s]  I highlighted text.
[3826.74s -> 3827.62s]  Stop.
[3827.62s -> 3828.34s]  I'm trying to get...
[3830.73s -> 3832.09s]  My fucking god.
[3833.86s -> 3834.18s]  Okay.
[3834.18s -> 3834.98s]  We're finally done.
[3834.98s -> 3835.62s]  We're finally done.
[3835.62s -> 3836.42s]  We're ready.
[3836.42s -> 3836.90s]  I'm going to...
[3836.90s -> 3838.74s]  I remember half of these answers.
[3839.38s -> 3840.82s]  I remember half of these answers.
[3845.91s -> 3846.15s]  All right.
[3846.15s -> 3846.95s]  Impossible quiz.
[3846.95s -> 3847.43s]  I remember.
[3847.43s -> 3847.75s]  Let's go.
[3847.75s -> 3848.95s]  Let's see how many I remember.
[3848.95s -> 3849.51s]  Are you ready?
[3851.38s -> 3851.86s]  It's time.
[3852.50s -> 3853.78s]  Let's see if I can remember these.
[3854.66s -> 3856.76s]  How many holes in polo?
[3856.76s -> 3857.80s]  That's two because they're actually...
[3857.80s -> 3859.00s]  They're talking about the word polo.
[3859.72s -> 3860.28s]  No, they're not.
[3860.28s -> 3860.76s]  No, they're not.
[3860.76s -> 3861.08s]  I forgot.
[3861.08s -> 3861.80s]  I missed it already.
[3862.68s -> 3863.56s]  How many holes in a polo?
[3863.56s -> 3864.44s]  One because it's a t-shirt.
[3865.48s -> 3865.72s]  Okay.
[3865.72s -> 3866.28s]  That's wrong.
[3866.28s -> 3869.74s]  What?
[3869.74s -> 3871.02s]  Four because it's polo.
[3871.02s -> 3871.42s]  The word.
[3871.42s -> 3871.74s]  Okay.
[3872.54s -> 3873.42s]  Can a match box?

[3884.23s -> 3884.87s]  Onion.
[3884.87s -> 3885.75s]  That would be shallots.
[3886.31s -> 3888.47s]  The answer is really big.
[3888.47s -> 3889.03s]  An elephant.
[3889.67s -> 3890.55s]  Search for it.
[3890.55s -> 3891.93s]  It's not there.
[3891.93s -> 3892.79s]  It's not there.
[3892.79s -> 3893.35s]  It's right there.
[3893.91s -> 3895.27s]  What was the answer to question two?
[3895.27s -> 3895.83s]  It would be that one.

[3915.90s -> 3916.40s]  A hole.
[3917.30s -> 3919.29s]  I got kind of close though.
[3919.29s -> 3920.01s]  I could do it.
[3920.01s -> 3921.05s]  How many holes in a polo?
[3921.05s -> 3921.45s]  That'd be four.
[3921.45s -> 3922.09s]  Where's the music?
[3922.81s -> 3924.01s]  Isn't there usually music?
[3924.01s -> 3928.73s]  Where's the sounds?

[3939.45s -> 3940.17s]  The answer is really big.
[3940.17s -> 3941.05s]  It's an elephant.
[3941.05s -> 3942.25s]  Search for it right here.
[3942.25s -> 3942.89s]  What was the answer?
[3942.89s -> 3943.61s]  This one.
[3943.61s -> 3945.35s]  Teeth.
[3945.35s -> 3946.07s]  Uh, N.

[3963.10s -> 3964.70s]  It's G, but it's probably not G.
[3964.70s -> 3967.34s]  It is A, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[3967.34s -> 3970.14s]  It would be the letter E.
[3970.14s -> 3974.06s]  One, two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, H.
[3974.06s -> 3976.63s]  24 minus seven equals?

[4006.26s -> 4007.62s]  Yeah, no, it was deal.
[4007.62s -> 4009.48s]  I forget.
[4009.48s -> 4012.09s]  I think it was no seal.
[4012.09s -> 4013.37s]  Watch carefully.

[4195.62s -> 4196.66s]  Click the answer.
[4196.66s -> 4199.02s]  I told you I knew half of these already.
[4199.02s -> 4202.52s]  I played this so many times when I was younger.
[4202.52s -> 4203.08s]  That one.
[4203.08s -> 4203.48s]  Teeth.
[4204.44s -> 4205.00s]  This one.
[4205.00s -> 4206.04s]  Whoa, don't do that.
[4206.04s -> 4210.14s]  Don't right click.
[4210.14s -> 4210.70s]  Tang.
[4210.70s -> 4211.26s]  A torch.
[4212.44s -> 4213.00s]  Horus.
[4214.71s -> 4215.03s]  H.
[4215.90s -> 4216.70s]  Seventeen.
[4216.70s -> 4217.98s]  The hammer.
[4217.98s -> 4219.90s]  Blue, orange, green, green, yellow.
[4219.90s -> 4220.30s]  Go ahead.
[4220.86s -> 4221.34s]  Seal.
[4222.71s -> 4223.75s]  It's this one.
[4223.75s -> 4225.22s]  Fuzz a skip.
[4225.22s -> 4225.62s]  Ran.
[4226.34s -> 4226.82s]  Click the V.
[4229.94s -> 4231.16s]  It's shoe polish, right?
[4231.16s -> 4232.04s]  Yeah, okay.
[4232.04s -> 4232.28s]  R.
[4232.28s -> 4233.08s]  Spacey.
[4233.08s -> 4234.20s]  Go to 28.
[4234.20s -> 4235.48s]  That's abundance.
[4235.48s -> 4236.84s]  It was egg mayonnaise.
[4236.84s -> 4237.56s]  Start here.
[4237.56s -> 4238.36s]  Be careful.
[4238.36s -> 4238.92s]  Good.
[4238.92s -> 4240.04s]  Woof, woof, woof.
[4240.04s -> 4241.00s]  Baby Cham.
[4241.64s -> 4242.44s]  Seven.
[4242.44s -> 4243.24s]  Watch out.
[4243.24s -> 4245.75s]  What are you doing?
[4245.75s -> 4246.39s]  God gamer.
[4247.35s -> 4248.63s]  Boomer reliving his youth.
[4248.63s -> 4249.75s]  What are you linking here?
[4249.75s -> 4252.04s]  Put it in E mode only?
[4254.58s -> 4256.26s]  You lost 2,000 viewers.
[4257.06s -> 4257.54s]  Whatever.
[4257.54s -> 4258.26s]  I don't care.
[4258.26s -> 4259.64s]  Okay, I gotta get this right.
[4259.64s -> 4260.52s]  I'm on 36.
[4260.52s -> 4265.70s]  A walk, I think.
[4265.70s -> 4268.33s]  Okay.
[4268.33s -> 4270.73s]  Can you get this question wrong?
[4270.73s -> 4271.21s]  No way.
[4272.07s -> 4273.91s]  Mary Rose sat on a pin.
[4278.71s -> 4279.46s]  I think it's-
[4279.46s -> 4280.02s]  Oh, really?
[4280.58s -> 4281.78s]  No, it's not.
[4281.78s -> 4288.39s]  First her piles?
[4288.95s -> 4289.59s]  Mary Rose.
[4289.59s -> 4290.15s]  Okay.
[4290.15s -> 4292.33s]  Right here, right now.
[4292.33s -> 4292.97s]  Space here.
[4292.97s -> 4293.53s]  Cough drops.
[4293.53s -> 4294.73s]  Cylindrical adventures.
[4295.45s -> 4296.41s]  I don't remember.
[4296.41s -> 4298.87s]  Cough drops.
[4299.35s -> 4299.83s]  Nope.
[4299.83s -> 4304.12s]  Shit.
[4304.12s -> 4304.68s]  I don't remember.
[4304.68s -> 4305.32s]  I think it's adventures.
[4305.32s -> 4305.56s]  Yep.
[4305.56s -> 4306.68s]  Put the mouse here.
[4306.68s -> 4307.48s]  Don't touch pink.
[4307.48s -> 4310.41s]  Hmm, I've only had a bridge.
[4310.41s -> 4312.41s]  Uh, wait.
[4312.41s -> 4313.61s]  How do I do this one?
[4313.61s -> 4315.51s]  How do you do this one?
[4315.51s -> 4316.15s]  I forget.
[4316.15s -> 4317.35s]  Um, I've only had a bridge.
[4317.35s -> 4317.67s]  What's the-
[4317.67s -> 4318.23s]  What do I have to do?
[4320.78s -> 4321.26s]  Oh, shit.
[4321.26s -> 4321.50s]  Right.
[4321.50s -> 4322.14s]  I can right click.
[4325.30s -> 4325.62s]  Wing.
[4326.26s -> 4328.20s]  Okay.
[4328.20s -> 4330.28s]  Afro sexy bill.
[4332.44s -> 4333.32s]  Dirty rectum?
[4333.32s -> 4333.64s]  I think it's-
[4333.64s -> 4334.04s]  Is it dirt?
[4334.04s -> 4334.52s]  No, it's-
[4334.52s -> 4335.75s]  What is it?
[4335.75s -> 4337.03s]  I think it's dirty rectum.
[4337.03s -> 4349.08s]  I don't know why I thought it was dirty rectum.
[4349.08s -> 4350.20s]  That was stupid of me.
[4350.20s -> 4360.41s]  Okay, click the smallest one.
[4361.45s -> 4362.49s]  That's a tang.
[4362.49s -> 4363.45s]  We got a torch.
[4363.45s -> 4364.49s]  We got a horse.
[4365.05s -> 4365.96s]  Very cool.
[4368.81s -> 4370.31s]  H-17.
[4370.87s -> 4371.35s]  Hammer.
[4373.96s -> 4375.24s]  The funniest thing about this game is
[4375.24s -> 4376.28s]  I swear to God,
[4376.28s -> 4378.28s]  every like three to five years,
[4378.28s -> 4381.82s]  I come back and beat this game.
[4381.82s -> 4382.22s]  Seal.
[4382.78s -> 4388.89s]  I think everybody does that, right?
[4389.53s -> 4396.71s]  Woof, woof, woof.
[4396.71s -> 4397.35s]  Okay.
[4397.35s -> 4397.75s]  This one.
[4398.39s -> 4399.19s]  Seven.
[4399.19s -> 4399.67s]  Watch out.
[4401.34s -> 4401.82s]  Everybody?
[4401.82s -> 4402.70s]  I think a lot of people do.
[4402.70s -> 4405.56s]  I think at this point, yeah.
[4405.56s -> 4407.08s]  Emote only to keep him honest.
[4407.08s -> 4408.20s]  You can do that if you want.
[4408.20s -> 4409.26s]  Keep me honest.
[4409.26s -> 4409.82s]  That's fine.
[4409.82s -> 4411.34s]  Yeah, I mean, clearly.
[4411.34s -> 4413.10s]  You guys have to remember.
[4413.67s -> 4416.47s]  From the second that you see something on screen,
[4416.47s -> 4419.51s]  it takes about five to eight seconds before,
[4419.51s -> 4421.06s]  like before you see it.
[4421.06s -> 4422.10s]  Like when I do something,
[4422.10s -> 4423.22s]  right now when I say,
[4423.22s -> 4428.54s]  you probably just heard it right there.
[4428.54s -> 4430.22s]  So it doesn't matter.
[4430.22s -> 4431.34s]  I've been doing it on my own.
[4431.34s -> 4431.94s]  All right.
[4431.94s -> 4433.22s]  I want everyone to do yes
[4433.22s -> 4435.62s]  when they hear this sound, okay?
[4435.62s -> 4436.60s]  We'll test it out.
[4437.56s -> 4441.62s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[4441.62s -> 4442.90s]  Okay, it's five seconds.
[4442.90s -> 4444.55s]  So it's five full seconds.
[4444.55s -> 4445.35s]  Let's try it again.
[4445.35s -> 4447.74s]  I want you to do Resident Sleepers.
[4447.74s -> 4448.30s]  No, don't do that.
[4448.30s -> 4450.46s]  I don't want people to think this is like a boring stream.
[4450.86s -> 4454.18s]  Do no, okay?
[4454.18s -> 4458.07s]  Two, three, four, five, five.
[4458.07s -> 4459.75s]  Yeah, it's about five full seconds.
[4459.75s -> 4465.03s]  No way.
[4465.03s -> 4466.23s]  It's Mary Rose.
[4466.23s -> 4467.43s]  There we go.
[4467.43s -> 4468.15s]  Bridge.
[4468.15s -> 4470.50s]  Okay, this one, what was it?
[4471.06s -> 4472.50s]  Is it Evil Eye?
[4473.06s -> 4474.66s]  Afro, okay.
[4474.66s -> 4477.30s]  What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?
[4477.30s -> 4478.50s]  It's 42.
[4478.50s -> 4481.54s]  Right, but it's weird.
[4481.54s -> 4489.16s]  No skipping here.
[4489.16s -> 4489.72s]  I forget.
[4489.72s -> 4492.06s]  There's a distinct reason.
[4492.06s -> 4494.30s]  I think you click on like the 40 second one.
[4494.38s -> 4494.94s]  Let's see.
[4494.94s -> 4498.78s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[4498.78s -> 4502.18s]  Ten, 20, 30, 40, 42.
[4502.18s -> 4503.50s]  There it is.
[4503.50s -> 4508.46s]  Bridget makes everyone a straight by Tom Cruise.
[4508.46s -> 4510.14s]  I remember Tom Cruise.
[4510.14s -> 4518.34s]  We're gonna put the piece together.
[4518.34s -> 4519.06s]  Uh, hold on.
[4519.62s -> 4520.97s]  There's no timer, so don't worry.
[4520.97s -> 4521.45s]  It doesn't matter.
[4522.01s -> 4525.38s]  Does this one say cheese?
[4526.58s -> 4528.01s]  Cheese check?
[4533.66s -> 4540.15s]  Cheerios flick here.
[4542.01s -> 4542.49s]  Oh, right.
[4542.49s -> 4543.37s]  Okay, hold on.
[4543.37s -> 4548.73s]  I can't move this one.
[4551.83s -> 4554.38s]  Click here.
[4554.38s -> 4556.46s]  Okay, we're good.
[4556.46s -> 4557.42s]  Good, good, good, good, good.
[4557.42s -> 4560.78s]  This is Wingdings, but I don't remember which one.
[4561.42s -> 4564.90s]  I believe it's, uh, I don't know.
[4564.90s -> 4565.38s]  I have no idea.
[4565.38s -> 4566.94s]  I have to guess top right.
[4566.94s -> 4567.82s]  Fucking beautiful.
[4567.82s -> 4569.45s]  One of the four chance.
[4569.45s -> 4570.89s]  Best flash, holy shit.
[4570.89s -> 4571.45s]  What's happening?
[4571.45s -> 4572.81s]  Best flash ever.
[4572.81s -> 4574.01s]  Man, oh my fucking God.
[4574.01s -> 4574.89s]  You kill Sonic.
[4574.89s -> 4575.85s]  You bastard.
[4575.85s -> 4576.33s]  It's that one.
[4579.38s -> 4580.50s]  What is this?
[4580.50s -> 4584.73s]  Where's my mouse?
[4585.29s -> 4591.75s]  Okay, snake, snake, snake.
[4591.83s -> 4593.11s]  Which is the correct spelling?
[4593.11s -> 4597.51s]  Slap-me-do, slap-me-do, spap-me-do, splap-me-do, it's slap-me-do.
[4598.31s -> 4598.87s]  Shit.
[4598.87s -> 4602.01s]  It's splap-me-do.
[4602.01s -> 4605.64s]  Remember, blue, red, blue, yellow.
[4605.64s -> 4612.02s]  Uh, 108 minus 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.
[4612.02s -> 4614.46s]  Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[4614.46s -> 4616.14s]  Remember, blue, red, blue, yellow.
[4621.32s -> 4622.81s]  Fuck.
[4622.81s -> 4629.91s]  Uh, blue, red, blue, yellow?
[4630.55s -> 4635.66s]  I'm gonna skip it.
[4635.66s -> 4635.98s]  I don't know.
[4636.78s -> 4637.28s]  Fight.
[4642.06s -> 4642.56s]  Hooray.
[4643.94s -> 4644.42s]  Carrot.
[4644.42s -> 4646.10s]  Holy shit, I guessed it correctly.
[4646.10s -> 4646.74s]  Accidentally.
[4646.74s -> 4647.54s]  Okay, that's the third one.
[4648.10s -> 4648.82s]  Marmite.
[4648.82s -> 4650.73s]  Uh, what is that?
[4650.73s -> 4651.05s]  Yum.
[4652.23s -> 4654.47s]  Butt-pa might not.
[4654.47s -> 4658.66s]  I only have one life left.
[4658.66s -> 4659.14s]  I don't know.
[4659.14s -> 4660.42s]  I can't take a chance.
[4660.42s -> 4662.84s]  I think it's urr.
[4662.84s -> 4664.26s]  Depends.
[4664.26s -> 4667.03s]  I think it's probably yum.
[4667.59s -> 4668.15s]  Nope.
[4668.15s -> 4668.87s]  Shit, it's urr.
[4673.59s -> 4673.91s]  Shit.
[4673.91s -> 4674.47s]  Okay, whatever.
[4674.47s -> 4675.83s]  I got it.
[4675.83s -> 4676.63s]  Pick the answer.
[4676.63s -> 4677.51s]  Yeah, move over here.
[4680.38s -> 4681.42s]  An elephant.
[4681.42s -> 4682.06s]  Search for it.
[4682.06s -> 4682.54s]  There it is.
[4683.10s -> 4683.98s]  That one.
[4683.98s -> 4685.91s]  Teeth.
[4685.91s -> 4687.19s]  And click the small one.
[4687.83s -> 4689.03s]  A tang.
[4689.03s -> 4690.71s]  Uh, a torch.
[4690.71s -> 4691.78s]  Spell it out.
[4693.61s -> 4698.78s]  School, H, uh, 17, blue, orange.
[4698.78s -> 4702.06s]  Queen, queen, yellow.
[4702.06s -> 4703.34s]  Oh, seeing Resonance Leapers.
[4703.98s -> 4706.06s]  Oh, see it, see it tomorrow when you wake up.
[4706.06s -> 4707.82s]  Cause I'm beating it.
[4707.82s -> 4709.99s]  This one.
[4709.99s -> 4710.95s]  This one.
[4710.95s -> 4712.97s]  This one.
[4712.97s -> 4714.06s]  This one.
[4714.06s -> 4717.18s]  Well, you guys should be thinking about the next game.
[4717.18s -> 4725.40s]  You should be thinking about the next Flash game.
[4725.40s -> 4726.20s]  Egg mayonnaise.
[4726.20s -> 4726.76s]  Here it is.
[4727.50s -> 4729.22s]  Woof, woof, woof.
[4729.22s -> 4730.34s]  Uh, baby.
[4730.34s -> 4732.47s]  Seven.
[4732.47s -> 4733.99s]  You guys should be thinking about the next Flash game.
[4736.49s -> 4737.69s]  That's only an hour.
[4737.69s -> 4738.49s]  I got plenty of time.
[4738.49s -> 4739.29s]  I'm just gonna get a water.
[4739.29s -> 4740.57s]  We'll get a coffee or something.
[4740.57s -> 4740.97s]  We'll hang out.
[4740.97s -> 4741.45s]  Whatever.
[4741.45s -> 4741.69s]  What?
[4741.69s -> 4744.73s]  Come on.
[4744.73s -> 4745.13s]  Away.
[4746.46s -> 4747.66s]  Uh, Mary Rose.
[4747.66s -> 4749.18s]  This one.
[4749.18s -> 4749.74s]  This one.
[4750.97s -> 4751.69s]  Okay.
[4751.69s -> 4752.49s]  Afro.
[4752.49s -> 4753.45s]  It's 42.
[4754.65s -> 4755.05s]  Shit.
[4755.05s -> 4756.01s]  It's the one below it.
[4756.01s -> 4757.61s]  Oh, god.
[4757.61s -> 4759.10s]  I'm cruise.
[4759.10s -> 4760.14s]  Click here.
[4760.14s -> 4765.29s]  All right, which one is this one?
[4765.29s -> 4766.57s]  It's not this one.
[4766.57s -> 4768.18s]  We have three more chances.
[4768.18s -> 4768.98s]  Top left.
[4768.98s -> 4770.58s]  That's bottom left.
[4771.30s -> 4771.70s]  Shit.
[4771.70s -> 4772.68s]  Top left.
[4772.76s -> 4773.88s]  Oh, god damn it.
[4773.88s -> 4774.28s]  Whatever.
[4774.28s -> 4774.60s]  Fuck.
[4774.60s -> 4774.92s]  Okay.
[4774.92s -> 4776.04s]  Nobody can.
[4776.04s -> 4776.44s]  K.O.
[4777.30s -> 4777.86s]  Get the answer.
[4777.86s -> 4778.26s]  It's this one.
[4778.26s -> 4778.74s]  Go over here.
[4778.74s -> 4779.80s]  Quick.
[4779.80s -> 4780.60s]  Hurry up.
[4780.60s -> 4781.56s]  Hurry.
[4781.56s -> 4782.84s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[4782.84s -> 4783.32s]  My voice.
[4783.32s -> 4784.36s]  Oh, no.
[4784.36s -> 4784.92s]  No, no.
[4784.92s -> 4786.36s]  I wasn't ready to come back.
[4786.36s -> 4788.04s]  I wasn't ready to come back yet.
[4788.04s -> 4788.68s]  I shouldn't have.
[4788.68s -> 4789.72s]  I should have waited another day.
[4789.72s -> 4791.24s]  I wasn't ready to come back.
[4791.24s -> 4792.28s]  Wasn't ready to come back.
[4792.28s -> 4793.40s]  I should have waited another day.
[4793.40s -> 4794.12s]  That's my fault.
[4794.12s -> 4795.08s]  I should have waited.
[4795.08s -> 4796.25s]  Okay.
[4796.25s -> 4797.53s]  What if I calm down and just stop?
[4797.53s -> 4800.33s]  I'm gonna just clear my throat for a second.
[4800.33s -> 4800.73s]  We're fine.
[4800.73s -> 4806.41s]  See, I'm back.
[4806.41s -> 4809.56s]  Blue, orange, green, green, yellow.
[4809.56s -> 4810.20s]  Seal.
[4810.20s -> 4811.90s]  This one.
[4811.90s -> 4812.30s]  Plus one.
[4812.30s -> 4812.86s]  Skip.
[4812.86s -> 4814.30s]  Ran.
[4814.30s -> 4815.10s]  That one.
[4815.10s -> 4816.70s]  Shoe polish.
[4816.70s -> 4817.74s]  Arse facey.
[4818.30s -> 4819.26s]  Abundance.
[4819.26s -> 4820.38s]  Egg mayonnaise.
[4821.26s -> 4826.42s]  By the way, I'd do this if the stream wasn't even turned on,
[4826.42s -> 4828.20s]  I would be doing this.
[4828.20s -> 4829.48s]  You say all the things.
[4830.12s -> 4830.92s]  Out loud.
[4830.92s -> 4832.07s]  Okay, baby.
[4832.07s -> 4832.23s]  Yeah.
[4832.23s -> 4832.95s]  Okay, seven.
[4832.95s -> 4834.44s]  This is the elephant part.
[4834.44s -> 4839.30s]  Okay, don't click it.
[4839.30s -> 4840.26s]  Wait till it changes.
[4840.26s -> 4843.45s]  Like this one.
[4843.45s -> 4844.65s]  Okay.
[4844.65s -> 4846.46s]  Okay, that's a walk.
[4846.46s -> 4847.58s]  In a way.
[4847.58s -> 4848.95s]  Mary Rose.
[4848.95s -> 4849.91s]  Cylindrical.
[4849.91s -> 4850.70s]  Watch that.
[4850.70s -> 4852.02s]  Get a right click.
[4852.02s -> 4852.34s]  Okay.
[4853.69s -> 4854.57s]  Afro, 42.
[4855.21s -> 4856.02s]  Tom Cruise.
[4857.29s -> 4858.73s]  Of course, everybody does that.
[4858.73s -> 4859.53s]  Don't lie to me.
[4859.53s -> 4860.09s]  Bottom right.
[4860.81s -> 4861.85s]  So what the hell is it?
[4861.85s -> 4867.72s]  I clicked on all of them.
[4867.72s -> 4872.38s]  Which one is it?
[4872.38s -> 4873.18s]  What?
[4873.18s -> 4881.69s]  I clicked on every single one of them.
[4882.25s -> 4889.45s]  It's not anything down here.
[4889.45s -> 4889.93s]  The number?
[4894.89s -> 4895.85s]  I can't cheat.
[4895.85s -> 4896.33s]  I can't.
[4897.69s -> 4898.81s]  It's one of the symbols?
[4907.51s -> 4907.83s]  Shit.
[4908.92s -> 4909.88s]  I don't know.
[4909.88s -> 4911.03s]  I don't know what to do.
[4911.03s -> 4911.91s]  I think I'm just gonna skip it.
[4921.86s -> 4922.10s]  Okay.
[4922.66s -> 4927.00s]  Snake.
[4927.00s -> 4927.40s]  Snake.
[4928.42s -> 4930.02s]  Splap me do, right?
[4930.02s -> 4930.74s]  Okay.
[4930.74s -> 4931.85s]  Now what is this one?
[4931.85s -> 4932.73s]  Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[4932.73s -> 4933.85s]  It's not what.
[4933.85s -> 4939.94s]  It's probably GTFO.
[4939.94s -> 4941.94s]  Oh, that was so popular at the time.
[4941.94s -> 4945.72s]  Really?
[4945.72s -> 4946.20s]  I can't.
[4946.92s -> 4952.46s]  This was so deeply in the lingo
[4952.46s -> 4953.98s]  back in early 2000s,
[4953.98s -> 4954.86s]  late 90s internet.
[4957.14s -> 4957.54s]  Okay.
[4958.42s -> 4959.96s]  I gotta skip it.
[4963.91s -> 4967.18s]  There's the carrot right here.
[4967.90s -> 4970.70s]  Okay.
[4970.70s -> 4971.42s]  It's ugh.
[4972.46s -> 4973.82s]  What the fuck?
[4973.82s -> 4974.46s]  No.
[4974.46s -> 4974.78s]  What?
[4981.83s -> 4982.95s]  Are you serious?
[4982.95s -> 4986.58s]  Some super obscure thing.
[4986.58s -> 4987.38s]  It's impossible.
[4987.38s -> 4988.58s]  That's the nature of the game.
[4988.58s -> 4988.90s]  Okay.
[4988.90s -> 4990.18s]  I gotta get the Wingdings one.
[4999.80s -> 5000.20s]  Horse.
[5001.51s -> 5002.23s]  Age.
[5002.23s -> 5003.11s]  17.
[5003.11s -> 5003.43s]  Yeah.
[5005.67s -> 5006.31s]  Oh.
[5006.31s -> 5007.43s]  Resident sleeper.
[5007.43s -> 5008.47s]  Resident sleeper.
[5008.47s -> 5009.59s]  Resident sleeper.
[5009.59s -> 5010.71s]  Resident sleeper.
[5010.71s -> 5011.83s]  Resident sleeper.
[5011.83s -> 5013.03s]  Resident sleeper.
[5013.03s -> 5014.23s]  Resident sleeper.
[5014.23s -> 5015.35s]  Resident sleeper.
[5016.49s -> 5017.61s]  Resident sleeper.
[5020.23s -> 5021.67s]  Why is he not listening to me?
[5021.67s -> 5023.27s]  Resident sleeper, I said.
[5031.37s -> 5032.33s]  What was that laugh?
[5033.13s -> 5033.37s]  No.
[5034.09s -> 5034.41s]  Shit.
[5034.41s -> 5035.69s]  I was looking over at you guys.
[5044.57s -> 5048.84s]  Dude, there's one
[5049.80s -> 5051.80s]  three, three, one, seven viewers here
[5051.80s -> 5052.92s]  that's like late.
[5053.56s -> 5056.33s]  All right.
[5056.33s -> 5057.13s]  There's a lot of people here.
[5057.13s -> 5058.97s]  I'm like, am I trying to like make people leave?
[5058.97s -> 5060.65s]  Am I trying to make people think I'm like a dork?
[5061.53s -> 5061.77s]  No.
[5061.77s -> 5062.33s]  Stay.
[5062.33s -> 5062.97s]  All right.
[5062.97s -> 5073.77s]  All right.
[5073.77s -> 5074.97s]  What the fuck is this one?
[5082.12s -> 5084.12s]  I don't get it.
[5084.12s -> 5084.52s]  Flag.
[5085.48s -> 5085.96s]  Square.
[5086.94s -> 5087.42s]  Diamond.
[5092.90s -> 5093.22s]  Nay.
[5094.10s -> 5094.90s]  Yay.
[5094.90s -> 5095.54s]  Nay, nay.
[5096.62s -> 5096.94s]  No.
[5096.94s -> 5097.34s]  Yes.
[5097.34s -> 5097.90s]  No, no.
[5097.90s -> 5098.22s]  No.
[5098.22s -> 5098.62s]  Yes.
[5098.62s -> 5099.42s]  No, no.
[5099.42s -> 5100.46s]  What is that supposed to mean?
[5100.46s -> 5101.50s]  I can't figure.
[5101.50s -> 5101.90s]  No.
[5101.90s -> 5102.22s]  Yes.
[5102.22s -> 5102.54s]  No.
[5102.54s -> 5102.78s]  No.
[5103.66s -> 5105.42s]  What are you trying to convey to me?
[5106.15s -> 5107.19s]  What are you trying to say?
[5108.20s -> 5108.68s]  No.
[5108.68s -> 5109.08s]  Yes.
[5109.08s -> 5109.40s]  No.
[5109.40s -> 5109.56s]  No.
[5110.44s -> 5110.84s]  Wait.
[5110.84s -> 5111.32s]  No.
[5111.32s -> 5111.88s]  Yes.
[5111.88s -> 5112.12s]  No.
[5112.12s -> 5112.44s]  No.
[5112.44s -> 5114.78s]  But I clicked this one already.
[5114.78s -> 5115.58s]  What?
[5115.58s -> 5116.73s]  What?
[5116.73s -> 5117.29s]  I clicked.
[5119.37s -> 5120.49s]  I clicked that one.
[5124.87s -> 5125.83s]  You're in emote only.
[5125.83s -> 5127.19s]  So no backseating.
[5127.19s -> 5127.67s]  I know.
[5127.67s -> 5130.15s]  But I didn't understand.
[5130.15s -> 5130.87s]  I didn't get it.
[5133.13s -> 5134.01s]  I didn't get it.
[5134.01s -> 5135.21s]  And it was so obvious.
[5135.85s -> 5136.09s]  All right.
[5136.09s -> 5137.21s]  Splat we do.
[5137.21s -> 5137.69s]  OK.
[5137.69s -> 5138.49s]  What about this one?
[5141.90s -> 5144.86s]  Blue, red, blue, blue, blue, red, blue, yellow.
[5145.90s -> 5149.13s]  Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[5155.21s -> 5156.33s]  They're cheating again.
[5156.33s -> 5157.13s]  They're cheating again.
[5157.13s -> 5157.69s]  They're cheating.
[5158.33s -> 5165.78s]  They're cheating.
[5165.78s -> 5166.66s]  You can cheat.
[5166.66s -> 5167.38s]  You know what?
[5167.38s -> 5171.85s]  It would be actually easier if emote only mode was off.
[5171.85s -> 5175.45s]  Because then you guys can't do the connect four to tell me what to do.
[5175.45s -> 5177.21s]  It would get lost.
[5177.21s -> 5180.15s]  OK.
[5180.15s -> 5180.79s]  It's not yum.
[5180.79s -> 5181.35s]  It's not.
[5182.78s -> 5183.42s]  What is that?
[5183.42s -> 5184.54s]  It's probably what is that?
[5184.54s -> 5187.66s]  Because a lot of Americans don't eat this.
[5190.10s -> 5190.58s]  Nope.
[5190.58s -> 5191.06s]  Shit.
[5191.06s -> 5192.66s]  But Pah might not.
[5192.66s -> 5193.78s]  What does that even mean?
[5193.78s -> 5198.20s]  What the fuck does that mean?
[5198.92s -> 5202.62s]  Shanghai is indeed the largest city in China.
[5202.62s -> 5203.58s]  Why is there a question mark?
[5205.11s -> 5206.63s]  About 20 centimeters off the ground.
[5206.63s -> 5207.03s]  Never been.
[5207.59s -> 5210.94s]  Why is there a question mark?
[5210.94s -> 5211.85s]  It's true.
[5219.61s -> 5220.17s]  It's never been.
[5222.90s -> 5223.78s]  God damn it.
[5230.34s -> 5231.14s]  Nostalgia.
[5232.74s -> 5233.78s]  Hey, do you guys remember?
[5234.94s -> 5236.54s]  Hey, and who remembers this?
[5236.54s -> 5238.12s]  Nostalgia gaming.
[5238.76s -> 5241.50s]  Everyone's probably playing cyberpunk right now.
[5241.50s -> 5242.70s]  No, not me.
[5242.70s -> 5244.06s]  I'm a contrarian asshole.
[5246.09s -> 5246.81s]  New game that came out.
[5246.81s -> 5247.53s]  It's like a big AAA game.
[5247.53s -> 5248.25s]  People have been waiting for years.
[5248.25s -> 5248.81s]  No, not me.
[5248.81s -> 5249.53s]  Contrarian.
[5249.53s -> 5250.49s]  I don't do that here.
[5250.49s -> 5267.19s]  No, we do things that go under the radar.
[5267.19s -> 5271.43s]  There's tons of streams you can watch to play cyberpunk.
[5271.43s -> 5271.99s]  But not for a minute.
[5277.43s -> 5279.83s]  I yell that to myself in the mirror every stream.
[5284.54s -> 5284.94s]  28.
[5285.50s -> 5285.98s]  Abundance.
[5286.54s -> 5288.22s]  Egg mayonnaise.
[5288.22s -> 5289.10s]  Don't screw it up.
[5289.74s -> 5291.21s]  Triple woof.
[5291.21s -> 5295.46s]  What do you guys do?
[5295.46s -> 5296.74s]  There's no answers that I'm looking for.
[5297.30s -> 5301.54s]  How was you guys week, by the way?
[5301.54s -> 5303.38s]  How was you guys like Thanksgiving and stuff?
[5303.38s -> 5305.82s]  Wait, I streamed after Thanksgiving, didn't I?
[5305.82s -> 5306.94s]  Yeah, what am I talking about?
[5307.50s -> 5312.62s]  I almost fucked that up.
[5312.62s -> 5315.75s]  You guys can't even answer me.
[5315.75s -> 5319.32s]  Wait, which one was it again?
[5319.32s -> 5320.44s]  Top right, right?
[5320.44s -> 5320.76s]  Yes.
[5326.87s -> 5327.27s]  Snake.
[5327.83s -> 5328.47s]  Splat be do.
[5329.51s -> 5330.15s]  Wait, which one?
[5330.15s -> 5330.71s]  Is that okay?
[5331.35s -> 5331.91s]  I forget.
[5331.91s -> 5332.87s]  I forget this one already.
[5332.87s -> 5333.83s]  I think it's okay.
[5333.83s -> 5336.66s]  Do I forget this one already?
[5336.66s -> 5339.66s]  Okay, I got it.
[5339.66s -> 5345.88s]  It kind of looks like Rocco from Rocco's Modern Life.
[5345.88s -> 5350.26s]  All right, Papa.
[5350.26s -> 5352.47s]  Why is there a question mark?
[5353.43s -> 5353.75s]  Shit.
[5356.17s -> 5358.65s]  Is indeed the largest city in China.
[5360.92s -> 5361.96s]  Oh my god.
[5361.96s -> 5363.16s]  So it's the fourth one.
[5363.16s -> 5366.62s]  Oh, about 20 centimeters off the ground.
[5366.62s -> 5367.18s]  Oh my god.
[5367.18s -> 5369.02s]  What is the digestive system?
[5369.02s -> 5369.67s]  A series...
[5369.67s -> 5370.39s]  Oh god.
[5370.39s -> 5373.05s]  A series of workers to break down food and extract energy and nutrients.
[5373.05s -> 5373.37s]  Cheese.
[5374.25s -> 5387.29s]  I thought it was going to be a meme answer or something.
[5387.29s -> 5391.16s]  At least I got to that point now.
[5391.16s -> 5400.70s]  The best part about this is every time I start over, it's just a wave of resident sleepers.
[5400.70s -> 5404.46s]  It's like, isn't that the nature of the game to like have to go through it a bunch of times?
[5407.30s -> 5408.18s]  That's the whole point.
[5408.82s -> 5416.02s]  I'm getting that 100 million off.
[5416.02s -> 5416.66s]  I'm telling you.
[5416.66s -> 5417.30s]  It's going to happen.
[5429.94s -> 5432.18s]  Cyberpunk 2024.
[5433.54s -> 5434.18s]  20...
[5434.18s -> 5434.50s]  40...
[5434.50s -> 5434.90s]  What is it?
[5436.90s -> 5438.10s]  2044?
[5438.10s -> 5438.90s]  2077?
[5439.46s -> 5442.02s]  No, that's 2024 is the one that I have.
[5442.02s -> 5443.30s]  2024, right?
[5443.70s -> 5445.82s]  Who cares?
[5445.82s -> 5453.83s]  Why did they just name it cyberpunk in the future?
[5453.83s -> 5455.83s]  But like, it's just cyberpunk.
[5455.83s -> 5457.51s]  Why does it have to have a year on it?
[5457.51s -> 5462.50s]  Because you know what's going to happen.
[5462.50s -> 5466.82s]  In like 2080 in real life, people are going to be laughing at that game.
[5466.82s -> 5470.30s]  They're going to be looking back and going like, yeah, look what they thought was going to happen.
[5470.30s -> 5473.27s]  Don't ever put a year.
[5473.27s -> 5478.87s]  Look at how much we make fun of that.
[5478.87s -> 5480.07s]  Like, danger Will Robinson.
[5480.07s -> 5481.03s]  Danger Will Robinson.
[5481.03s -> 5483.19s]  They thought that was going to happen in like 1992.
[5483.83s -> 5489.54s]  Didn't.
[5489.54s -> 5490.42s]  You get this question wrong.
[5490.42s -> 5491.22s]  No way.
[5491.22s -> 5492.42s]  Mary Rose.
[5493.16s -> 5493.40s]  Yes.
[5494.12s -> 5494.44s]  Cheat.
[5495.22s -> 5496.02s]  Thank you.
[5496.02s -> 5496.82s]  Go.
[5496.82s -> 5497.62s]  42.
[5497.62s -> 5498.68s]  Tom Cruise.
[5498.68s -> 5499.40s]  Click this.
[5499.40s -> 5501.66s]  Click this one.
[5501.66s -> 5502.54s]  That's Sonic.
[5502.54s -> 5506.58s]  You guys chilling out?
[5506.58s -> 5508.34s]  How you guys doing on a chill...
[5508.34s -> 5509.38s]  I don't even know what day of the week it is.
[5509.38s -> 5509.86s]  I don't even know.
[5511.66s -> 5514.62s]  If you made me tell you what day of the week it is right now,
[5514.62s -> 5517.82s]  for a million dollars, I would not be able to tell you.
[5517.82s -> 5523.48s]  Jeremy, I'm going to give you one fucking million dollars in cash.
[5523.48s -> 5524.84s]  Taxed, by the way.
[5524.84s -> 5525.80s]  You don't have to pay taxes.
[5525.80s -> 5526.68s]  It's like, taxed.
[5526.68s -> 5527.32s]  One million.
[5527.32s -> 5528.12s]  Cash.
[5528.12s -> 5529.64s]  I can't tell you what day it is.
[5529.64s -> 5532.65s]  I don't know.
[5532.65s -> 5533.29s]  It's Wednesday.
[5533.29s -> 5533.69s]  Nope.
[5533.69s -> 5534.17s]  No, what's today?
[5534.17s -> 5534.97s]  Is it Wednesday?
[5534.97s -> 5536.23s]  Did I get the money?
[5536.23s -> 5536.79s]  It's Wednesday.
[5536.79s -> 5537.11s]  I win.
[5537.11s -> 5537.83s]  I'll take it.
[5537.83s -> 5540.68s]  I was going to say Thursday.
[5540.68s -> 5544.92s]  Splat me do.
[5544.92s -> 5545.24s]  Okay.
[5545.96s -> 5546.60s]  Make a...
[5546.60s -> 5547.24s]  Make a fight.
[5549.75s -> 5550.15s]  Nice.
[5550.15s -> 5550.95s]  I win.
[5550.95s -> 5554.62s]  Garrett.
[5554.62s -> 5554.86s]  Nay.
[5557.56s -> 5558.36s]  Is this one...
[5558.36s -> 5559.40s]  Okay, here we go.
[5559.40s -> 5561.64s]  A series of organs that break down food.
[5561.64s -> 5564.36s]  A games console for whole meal biscuits.
[5564.36s -> 5565.08s]  A series of...
[5565.08s -> 5565.88s]  This one.
[5565.88s -> 5567.38s]  Something best by...
[5567.38s -> 5568.10s]  This one!
[5568.10s -> 5569.32s]  Okay, it's top right.
[5569.32s -> 5570.97s]  It was top right.
[5570.97s -> 5573.59s]  I do remember.
[5573.59s -> 5574.15s]  It was...
[5574.15s -> 5574.47s]  Wait.
[5574.47s -> 5577.03s]  Remember the color or remember where the placement was?
[5577.27s -> 5577.91s]  It was red.
[5579.30s -> 5579.70s]  Shit!
[5579.70s -> 5580.66s]  It was placement.
[5580.66s -> 5588.36s]  That was a wave of resident sleepers.
[5595.67s -> 5596.63s]  So predictable.
[5597.27s -> 5598.39s]  At least do it...
[5598.39s -> 5601.11s]  Okay, at least do it by question 30.
[5601.11s -> 5608.63s]  You can't just do it at question 1 through 10 and then stop.
[5608.63s -> 5609.99s]  You can't just do that.
[5609.99s -> 5611.91s]  You have to do it like the whole time.
[5612.47s -> 5614.47s]  But don't do it the whole time because that...
[5614.47s -> 5614.95s]  What the hell?
[5615.75s -> 5617.03s]  Don't do that the whole time.
[5626.04s -> 5628.84s]  Okay, blue, orange, green, green, yellow.
[5628.84s -> 5631.48s]  You better be getting the next game ready because I'm going to beat this soon.
[5631.48s -> 5641.88s]  I have this weird memory that's coming back to me right now.
[5644.82s -> 5648.15s]  It was four, five o'clock in the morning.
[5648.15s -> 5654.01s]  I was in college and I was incredibly tired and just over exhausted.
[5654.01s -> 5660.79s]  And I was playing this and my body and brain wanted so badly to go to sleep.
[5660.79s -> 5661.43s]  But I wouldn't.
[5661.43s -> 5664.15s]  I had like class the next day.
[5664.15s -> 5667.74s]  I just was sitting there just with my eyes just burning.
[5668.78s -> 5670.14s]  I was on the question 50.
[5670.14s -> 5671.02s]  I'll go to the beginning.
[5671.02s -> 5672.14s]  Go through, go through, go through.
[5672.14s -> 5674.76s]  Question 55, go to the beginning.
[5674.76s -> 5676.52s]  And I think I had closed my laptop.
[5676.52s -> 5678.94s]  I was like, I have to go to fucking bed now.
[5679.50s -> 5680.78s]  I can't do this anymore.
[5680.78s -> 5688.74s]  Do you know when you're lying down in bed and you know that you should be sleeping
[5688.74s -> 5690.97s]  but you just don't?
[5690.97s -> 5697.29s]  Because your mind just needs to just continue to do something.
[5697.29s -> 5700.09s]  Sleeping is too boring for your brain at that moment.
[5700.09s -> 5704.09s]  Even though your brain and body are like, dude, just fucking put your iPad down.
[5704.09s -> 5704.89s]  Put your phone down.
[5704.89s -> 5705.53s]  Just close your eyes.
[5705.53s -> 5707.13s]  You'll be asleep in 30 seconds.
[5707.13s -> 5709.74s]  It's like, no, I don't want to do that.
[5709.74s -> 5712.14s]  I like want to keep playing the impossible quiz.
[5712.14s -> 5714.22s]  I want to keep watching this woodcutting video.
[5714.22s -> 5727.30s]  So judging by all the residents sleepers, it feels like a lot of you guys are doing
[5727.30s -> 5728.02s]  that right now.
[5728.02s -> 5739.64s]  It's fun.
[5739.64s -> 5740.76s]  Okay, here we go.
[5740.76s -> 5741.56s]  This is where it gets a little...
[5741.56s -> 5743.46s]  Okay, I got to remember this.
[5743.46s -> 5744.50s]  Is it placement?
[5745.14s -> 5746.02s]  It's placement.
[5746.02s -> 5747.54s]  So it's right there.
[5747.54s -> 5749.30s]  Right here, right kind of in the top kind of center.
[5754.66s -> 5755.78s]  I thought it was color.
[5755.78s -> 5763.18s]  Oh, by the way, anybody know how long are the game awards?
[5763.18s -> 5766.17s]  How many hours?
[5766.81s -> 5770.74s]  Like just write yay and write how many hours it is.
[5770.74s -> 5774.49s]  Judging by the amount of residents sleepers, whatever.
[5774.49s -> 5778.39s]  Okay, four residents sleepers in four hours?
[5778.39s -> 5779.27s]  Three hours?
[5779.27s -> 5780.79s]  Is it three hours?
[5781.35s -> 5786.57s]  Okay, four residents sleepers in four hours.
[5786.57s -> 5787.05s]  Three, okay.
[5787.61s -> 5790.39s]  All right, here we go.
[5790.39s -> 5791.19s]  I hope I remembered.
[5791.19s -> 5794.95s]  It's right here.
[5794.95s -> 5795.35s]  Right there.
[5796.70s -> 5797.66s]  What?
[5797.66s -> 5798.38s]  What?
[5798.38s -> 5799.50s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[5799.50s -> 5799.74s]  What?
[5803.53s -> 5804.25s]  What are you talking about?
[5804.81s -> 5806.14s]  Is it hidden somewhere?
[5806.78s -> 5809.74s]  What?
[5809.74s -> 5813.21s]  It was the red one, but it was up here.
[5813.21s -> 5814.81s]  I clicked red last time and it was wrong.
[5815.45s -> 5819.51s]  What just happened?
[5821.16s -> 5821.48s]  What?
[5821.48s -> 5831.83s]  What the fuck was that?
[5836.31s -> 5836.63s]  What?
[5837.35s -> 5838.07s]  No.
[5838.07s -> 5838.39s]  What?
[5839.85s -> 5842.36s]  What?
[5842.36s -> 5843.08s]  What?
[5843.08s -> 5847.19s]  I don't understand.
[5847.19s -> 5848.39s]  It was correct for a second.
[5854.49s -> 5855.29s]  All right, turn off.
[5855.93s -> 5857.05s]  Turn off emote only mode.
[5857.05s -> 5858.57s]  I want some suggestions on there.
[5858.57s -> 5860.25s]  I'm going to do the same thing I did when I was in college.
[5860.81s -> 5861.93s]  I'm going to get to question 16.
[5861.93s -> 5863.53s]  Just close the laptop and be like, fuck this.
[5873.29s -> 5874.89s]  Blue, red, blue.
[5874.89s -> 5878.30s]  Oh, okay.
[5879.88s -> 5881.56s]  I get you now.
[5881.56s -> 5882.92s]  I see what you're saying.
[5882.92s -> 5883.24s]  Okay.
[5883.88s -> 5885.75s]  This is the worst game ever.
[5885.75s -> 5887.51s]  It's a classic.
[5887.67s -> 5889.83s]  It's like saying that like Super Mario is the worst game ever.
[5900.74s -> 5901.38s]  Stop.
[5901.38s -> 5902.10s]  You made your point.
[5902.74s -> 5904.73s]  Wait, what do you guys think?
[5905.37s -> 5906.57s]  You think I'm making a point?
[5907.64s -> 5908.20s]  What do you mean?
[5908.20s -> 5909.32s]  I'm trying to get through this.
[5909.32s -> 5911.16s]  I have a hundred million on the line.
[5911.16s -> 5912.36s]  The deal is off the table.
[5912.36s -> 5912.60s]  What?
[5913.16s -> 5916.42s]  What are you talking about?
[5916.42s -> 5917.14s]  There's no deal.
[5917.14s -> 5918.50s]  The deal is off the table.
[5918.50s -> 5923.08s]  How is it off the table?
[5923.08s -> 5923.88s]  I cheated?
[5924.44s -> 5925.00s]  When did I?
[5925.00s -> 5926.12s]  What are you talking about?
[5926.12s -> 5927.94s]  When did I cheat?
[5930.30s -> 5931.10s]  Off the table.
[5931.10s -> 5931.66s]  No deal.
[5931.66s -> 5933.26s]  You had one shot.
[5933.26s -> 5938.06s]  So wait, it's been an emote only mode this whole time
[5938.06s -> 5939.50s]  and you guys have desperately been telling me
[5939.50s -> 5940.54s]  that I don't have to keep doing this
[5940.54s -> 5948.10s]  because I lost the bet already?
[5948.10s -> 5948.74s]  Oh.
[5948.74s -> 5952.65s]  Well, now I kind of want to just do it.
[5953.29s -> 5960.42s]  Keep going.
[5960.98s -> 5962.63s]  I know I'm close to the end.
[5963.43s -> 5965.03s]  There's like 80 questions or something, right?
[5965.67s -> 5968.97s]  We have to pay him to stop.
[5968.97s -> 5970.49s]  No, you don't have to pay me to stop.
[5971.42s -> 5974.30s]  Don't pay me to stop.
[5974.30s -> 5974.62s]  Okay.
[5974.62s -> 5976.14s]  Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[5991.16s -> 5991.40s]  Okay.
[5991.40s -> 5991.96s]  I did.
[5991.96s -> 5993.40s]  Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[5994.84s -> 5995.56s]  Hey, lobster.
[5995.56s -> 5997.32s]  Thanks for the five community subs.
[5997.32s -> 6000.60s]  Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[6000.60s -> 6001.66s]  Look out.
[6001.66s -> 6004.15s]  Count Dracula.
[6004.15s -> 6005.19s]  He's a sexy one.
[6005.19s -> 6005.43s]  Sorry.
[6005.43s -> 6006.47s]  I prefer lemurs.
[6006.47s -> 6006.87s]  I don't know.
[6008.33s -> 6008.97s]  Look.
[6008.97s -> 6010.09s]  Count Dracula.
[6010.09s -> 6010.41s]  One.
[6010.97s -> 6011.69s]  Okay.
[6011.69s -> 6014.57s]  On the subject of Dracula, what is his favorite food?
[6014.57s -> 6015.21s]  Shepherd's pie.
[6016.23s -> 6017.43s]  Charge the laser.
[6017.43s -> 6019.46s]  How?
[6019.46s -> 6024.55s]  Oh, how do I do that?
[6024.55s -> 6025.35s]  Shoot it.
[6025.35s -> 6029.46s]  Be honest.
[6029.46s -> 6032.10s]  Did you manage to do the last question on your first go?
[6032.10s -> 6033.14s]  Yes, I did.
[6033.14s -> 6040.17s]  Is that a butt?
[6050.18s -> 6054.42s]  If thimple, click the moth.
[6056.86s -> 6058.62s]  If thimple, click the moth.
[6059.90s -> 6060.22s]  What?
[6060.78s -> 6062.30s]  Oh, the moss, not the mop.
[6062.86s -> 6063.58s]  The moth.
[6063.58s -> 6063.82s]  Okay.
[6064.78s -> 6066.22s]  What are chicken nuggets made of?
[6067.11s -> 6068.63s]  Tasteless white filth.
[6074.92s -> 6075.24s]  Win.
[6076.22s -> 6077.58s]  It's definitely, it's not.
[6077.58s -> 6077.90s]  Soil?
[6081.42s -> 6081.90s]  I don't know.
[6081.90s -> 6083.18s]  So I'll come back to it.
[6083.18s -> 6083.42s]  Skip.
[6084.22s -> 6085.10s]  Which is true.
[6085.10s -> 6086.78s]  PSP is better than the DS.
[6087.34s -> 6089.10s]  The DS is better than the PSP.
[6089.75s -> 6091.75s]  PSP is the DS.
[6091.75s -> 6098.42s]  Or egg is better than 28.
[6098.42s -> 6099.14s]  Egg.
[6099.14s -> 6100.26s]  Click the largest.
[6104.36s -> 6105.40s]  It's gonna be a trick.
[6105.40s -> 6108.15s]  This is a trick.
[6108.15s -> 6109.99s]  It's probably, I don't know.
[6109.99s -> 6110.87s]  Click the largest.
[6111.67s -> 6113.42s]  Got it.
[6113.42s -> 6113.74s]  Hurry up.
[6113.74s -> 6114.54s]  It's the end of the world.
[6115.18s -> 6115.74s]  Armageddon.
[6115.74s -> 6117.18s]  Oh my fucking god.
[6117.18s -> 6117.66s]  D.
[6117.66s -> 6118.30s]  Armageddon.
[6118.30s -> 6118.46s]  D.
[6143.10s -> 6144.14s]  No, what else?
[6144.14s -> 6145.34s]  What do you want me to do?
[6145.34s -> 6146.62s]  I'm not playing cyberpunk.
[6148.89s -> 6149.77s]  What's that?
[6149.77s -> 6150.57s]  Fucking stop it.
[6150.57s -> 6150.81s]  All right.
[6150.81s -> 6151.61s]  What's the next game then?
[6157.70s -> 6159.14s]  What's the next flash game?
[6159.78s -> 6161.10s]  Well, you guys figure it out.
[6161.10s -> 6168.84s]  You guys will debate it in chat for like a few minutes.
[6168.84s -> 6169.40s]  Cool math.
[6169.40s -> 6174.25s]  I've done cool math.
[6174.25s -> 6174.97s]  Pop-up games.
[6174.97s -> 6175.85s]  Age of War.
[6177.85s -> 6179.29s]  Age of War?
[6179.29s -> 6182.22s]  I feel like that's gonna take a while.
[6182.22s -> 6183.58s]  I feel like it's like a strategy game or something.
[6184.60s -> 6185.24s]  Yes, do that.
[6185.24s -> 6186.52s]  Is that like an idle game?
[6186.52s -> 6188.28s]  You guys are gonna be mad at me for that one.
[6188.28s -> 6192.82s]  Do Age of War.
[6192.82s -> 6197.35s]  I will after this.
[6197.35s -> 6197.51s]  All right.
[6197.51s -> 6198.63s]  I'm gonna see if I can get through here.
[6198.63s -> 6209.93s]  Cookie clicker.
[6209.93s -> 6212.01s]  I did an idle game already.
[6214.54s -> 6215.90s]  Swords and sandals.
[6215.90s -> 6216.78s]  I'm seeing a lot of that.
[6216.78s -> 6217.18s]  Is that good?
[6217.90s -> 6228.04s]  I, no, I legit refuse to play Happy Wheels.
[6228.76s -> 6229.80s]  I refuse.
[6229.80s -> 6238.15s]  I'm never gonna play that game ever for any reason.
[6238.71s -> 6244.86s]  Both swords and sandals.
[6244.86s -> 6245.34s]  Is it good?
[6249.83s -> 6250.47s]  Any reason?
[6251.03s -> 6253.53s]  I wouldn't even do it for a million dollars.
[6262.63s -> 6264.36s]  Play Roblox.
[6264.36s -> 6267.90s]  Hey, I'll play Roblox when their IPO comes out.
[6267.90s -> 6268.78s]  We can celebrate it.
[6269.50s -> 6271.22s]  They went public.
[6271.78s -> 6272.42s]  Yeah.
[6272.42s -> 6274.10s]  Is it gonna be like, uh.
[6274.10s -> 6276.41s]  Swords and sandals.
[6276.41s -> 6276.89s]  I'll check it out.

[6284.49s -> 6285.85s]  Blue, red, blue, yellow.
[6291.06s -> 6291.54s]  Okay.
[6291.54s -> 6291.86s]  One.
[6292.42s -> 6294.14s]  His favorite food is shepherd's pie.
[6295.88s -> 6301.08s]  Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot it, shoot it, shoot it.
[6301.08s -> 6302.52s]  Play Raid Shadow Legends.
[6302.52s -> 6302.92s]  No.
[6302.92s -> 6304.12s]  That doesn't, that will never happen.
[6305.45s -> 6306.89s]  I did it on my first try.
[6306.89s -> 6307.37s]  Thumbs up.
[6308.23s -> 6310.23s]  Click the moth.
[6310.23s -> 6315.42s]  Now this, I'm stuck here.
[6315.42s -> 6321.98s]  Play Spongebob flip flop.
[6321.98s -> 6322.70s]  I'll try, um.
[6324.81s -> 6327.03s]  I just clicked on like the first five.
[6327.03s -> 6328.39s]  It was five people said win in a row.
[6328.39s -> 6329.35s]  And I, or I did, no.
[6329.91s -> 6332.01s]  Faceless white filth.
[6332.01s -> 6332.25s]  Okay.
[6332.97s -> 6334.17s]  I already knew the answer to that.
[6334.17s -> 6334.41s]  Egg.
[6335.05s -> 6335.85s]  Like the largest.
[6336.73s -> 6337.05s]  Okay.
[6337.05s -> 6338.09s]  Armageddon.
[6338.09s -> 6339.21s]  Hurry up, it's the end of the world.
[6339.21s -> 6339.69s]  Armageddon.
[6340.33s -> 6341.53s]  Oh my fucking, Australia.
[6342.25s -> 6342.49s]  What?
[6344.12s -> 6345.24s]  Oh my god, damn it.
[6345.88s -> 6346.92s]  We'll figure it out the next game.
[6346.92s -> 6348.44s]  We'll just figure, we'll get the next game figured out.
[6348.44s -> 6351.38s]  We're gonna play swords and sandals, possibly.
[6351.38s -> 6354.98s]  Any other things that you guys have up your sleeve.
[6354.98s -> 6360.58s]  Swords and sandals, um.
[6360.58s -> 6362.74s]  Balloons, tower defense is a pretty good idea.
[6362.74s -> 6369.43s]  Swords and sandals is long enough.
[6369.43s -> 6370.47s]  Okay, all right.
[6370.47s -> 6371.75s]  Madness interactive.
[6371.75s -> 6372.55s]  That's an interesting game.
[6372.55s -> 6375.03s]  But please, why don't you guys explain, tell me about it.
[6375.03s -> 6378.86s]  What is the premise of madness interactive?
[6378.86s -> 6379.66s]  What do you do?
[6380.22s -> 6382.18s]  Tell me, I'd like to read about it.
[6382.18s -> 6383.98s]  For the next five to ten minutes.
[6384.90s -> 6385.78s]  Balloons six.
[6387.06s -> 6387.86s]  It sucks.
[6387.86s -> 6390.02s]  Okay, well, that's why we're having this debate.
[6390.02s -> 6391.62s]  That's why we're spending the time here.
[6391.62s -> 6393.62s]  To make sure we get everybody's opinions on the matter.
[6397.72s -> 6398.28s]  Tropica.
[6399.72s -> 6400.68s]  That's interesting too.
[6401.40s -> 6402.28s]  Let's check that out.
[6404.12s -> 6405.48s]  Interactive buddy.
[6405.48s -> 6409.66s]  Wait, is that the moment you just kind of throw the guy around a room?
[6409.66s -> 6417.08s]  And you like punch him in the face and stuff and like throw stuff at him?
[6417.08s -> 6419.90s]  All right, this is the last attempt, I swear to God, no matter what.
[6419.90s -> 6426.86s]  And I'm gonna open up sword and sandals.
[6426.86s -> 6429.02s]  No matter what, this is the final attempt.
[6429.02s -> 6432.44s]  People are, I'm looking at the capas.
[6432.44s -> 6434.20s]  Okay, let's make this interesting.
[6434.20s -> 6437.24s]  If I do another attempt, add a billion to the debt.
[6437.24s -> 6438.28s]  How's that sound?
[6438.28s -> 6439.96s]  Right, I got it, now I have to.
[6439.96s -> 6451.64s]  It's the last attempt.
[6451.64s -> 6453.77s]  Cruise, okay, okay.
[6454.49s -> 6458.73s]  This one, a final ninja.
[6460.26s -> 6461.14s]  Okay, put it on the list.
[6467.54s -> 6470.42s]  Play the world's hardest game.
[6470.42s -> 6471.78s]  No, I don't, let's play something fun.
[6473.05s -> 6474.89s]  Not that that game's not fun, but you know.
[6475.45s -> 6479.66s]  Age of War.
[6479.66s -> 6484.38s]  I got that, it's on the list.

[6493.03s -> 6493.67s]  Shepherd's Pie.
[6494.39s -> 6494.71s]  Shoot.
[6495.27s -> 6506.23s]  Okay, I got it on my first go.
[6506.23s -> 6506.71s]  Thumbs up.
[6507.43s -> 6507.83s]  Moss.
[6508.71s -> 6510.07s]  Tasteless white filth.
[6510.07s -> 6510.79s]  Egg.
[6510.79s -> 6511.91s]  Click the largest.
[6511.91s -> 6514.15s]  Okay, now the next one is the Armageddon one.
[6514.15s -> 6517.27s]  It's the end of the world.
[6517.27s -> 6520.07s]  Oh, shit, here we go.
[6520.07s -> 6520.63s]  Can I show this?
[6521.43s -> 6522.63s]  What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
[6524.68s -> 6525.80s]  What do I do, what do I do?
[6525.80s -> 6527.08s]  Okay, it's a big hairy asshole.
[6527.08s -> 6527.56s]  Whatever it was.
[6529.50s -> 6536.06s]  Oh, you have to pet the cat.
[6549.03s -> 6552.26s]  Okay, are you enjoying the quiz?
[6552.26s -> 6553.78s]  I'm level 69.
[6554.50s -> 6556.02s]  My dog's got no nose.
[6556.02s -> 6556.90s]  How does it smell?
[6557.96s -> 6558.84s]  How am I supposed to know?
[6559.48s -> 6560.68s]  Terrible, like piss.
[6564.55s -> 6565.51s]  Terrible, fuck.
[6567.27s -> 6568.47s]  How am I supposed to know?
[6571.38s -> 6573.30s]  Using my dog's got no nose.
[6573.30s -> 6574.10s]  How does it smell?
[6574.74s -> 6580.50s]  How am I supposed to know?
[6580.50s -> 6581.30s]  Using its anus?
[6582.02s -> 6582.90s]  Oh, Christ.
[6586.06s -> 6586.46s]  Search.
[6587.10s -> 6595.90s]  What am I searching for?
[6625.42s -> 6625.98s]  I got it.
[6626.62s -> 6627.42s]  Question mark.
[6631.48s -> 6633.00s]  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
[6633.00s -> 6633.40s]  I don't understand.
[6633.40s -> 6634.92s]  What is it trying to ask me?
[6638.44s -> 6639.24s]  It's just the same one.
[6639.24s -> 6641.16s]  How many questions does this quiz have?
[6641.88s -> 6642.97s]  100.
[6643.77s -> 6644.49s]  No one knows that.
[6644.49s -> 6646.25s]  You can't really class this as a quiz.
[6649.11s -> 6649.99s]  200.
[6650.07s -> 6651.27s]  It's not 200.
[6651.27s -> 6651.83s]  It's 100.
[6654.76s -> 6658.02s]  Skip it.
[6658.02s -> 6658.82s]  I don't know.
[6658.82s -> 6660.52s]  Skip it.
[6660.52s -> 6661.56s]  Be prepared.
[6661.56s -> 6665.22s]  Skip it, skip it.
[6666.20s -> 6667.96s]  You are my candy girl.
[6668.84s -> 6669.32s]  Sugar.
[6671.72s -> 6673.32s]  Oh, honey, honey.
[6675.88s -> 6678.44s]  You are my sugar.
[6678.44s -> 6679.32s]  Honey, honey.
[6680.04s -> 6680.68s]  Okay.
[6680.68s -> 6681.88s]  What is this?
[6681.88s -> 6683.48s]  It's a tea bag.
[6683.48s -> 6684.52s]  A testicle.
[6684.52s -> 6686.44s]  Mr. T's oven glove.
[6686.44s -> 6687.96s]  Question 77.
[6687.96s -> 6693.24s]  It's a tea bag.
[6693.72s -> 6694.92s]  But I don't know if it is.
[6694.92s -> 6695.40s]  I don't know.
[6695.40s -> 6696.12s]  It could be wrong.
[6698.17s -> 6698.67s]  Skip.
[6699.21s -> 6699.93s]  Déjà vu.
[6700.57s -> 6701.61s]  Plus one life.
[6702.17s -> 6703.10s]  Give it to me.
[6704.38s -> 6704.88s]  No!
[6709.13s -> 6711.37s]  No, I'm so close to the end of the game.
[6717.51s -> 6718.87s]  I'm so close.
[6718.87s -> 6720.71s]  There's like three questions left.
[6722.55s -> 6723.51s]  No, I have...
[6723.51s -> 6724.79s]  It's a billion dollars.
[6724.79s -> 6725.59s]  What's it at now?
[6726.82s -> 6727.46s]  No, I don't.
[6727.46s -> 6727.86s]  I can't.
[6727.86s -> 6728.74s]  That's a billion.
[6729.46s -> 6731.59s]  That's too much to add.
[6732.15s -> 6734.47s]  That's too...
[6734.47s -> 6734.95s]  No, I can't.
[6734.95s -> 6735.43s]  It's too much to add.
[6735.43s -> 6735.99s]  What's the next one?
[6735.99s -> 6736.71s]  Sword and sandals.
[6738.09s -> 6738.73s]  Sword and sandals.
[6738.73s -> 6739.53s]  Let's go.
[6739.53s -> 6741.56s]  God damn it.
[6741.56s -> 6742.44s]  I really want to beat it too.
[6744.87s -> 6746.07s]  Swords and sandals.
[6746.07s -> 6747.67s]  Wait, this is on Steam.
[6747.67s -> 6754.73s]  To buy this on Steam?
[6755.45s -> 6761.99s]  Hey Wiggly Joe, thanks for the 15 community subs.
[6762.89s -> 6764.41s]  15 subs.
[6764.41s -> 6765.29s]  You can if you want.
[6765.29s -> 6765.93s]  Where do I get it?
[6766.97s -> 6767.69s]  What can I just play it?
[6767.69s -> 6768.65s]  Is it on congregate?
[6772.31s -> 6775.32s]  Sword and sandals?
[6777.90s -> 6782.97s]  What the hell is it?
[6785.59s -> 6787.11s]  Swords and souls.
[6787.11s -> 6788.71s]  Swords and sandals?
[6789.67s -> 6792.39s]  Swords and sandals crusader.
[6792.39s -> 6793.75s]  Swords and sandals one.
[6793.75s -> 6795.11s]  Swords and sandals two.
[6795.99s -> 6797.83s]  I guess I'm just going to do the first one.
[6797.83s -> 6806.23s]  Loading game info.
[6806.87s -> 6807.67s]  Okay.
[6807.67s -> 6812.76s]  Oh, that scared the shit out of me.
[6825.53s -> 6829.62s]  Swords and sandals.
[6830.58s -> 6832.63s]  Is this game any good?
[6832.63s -> 6833.59s]  Swords and sandals two.
[6833.59s -> 6834.15s]  Waiting room.
[6834.15s -> 6835.03s]  But hold on.
[6835.67s -> 6837.85s]  I just...
[6837.85s -> 6838.33s]  I have...
[6838.33s -> 6839.37s]  This is the first game.
[6839.37s -> 6840.81s]  Can I even play the first one?
[6841.53s -> 6850.49s]  Okay.
[6850.49s -> 6851.77s]  Play.
[6851.77s -> 6852.33s]  How to play.
[6852.33s -> 6853.45s]  Click here to get an overview.
[6854.25s -> 6855.45s]  Swords and sandals is a...
[6855.45s -> 6856.33s]  Oops.
[6856.33s -> 6858.49s]  Is a mini epic gladiator game.
[6859.21s -> 6859.53s]  Wait.
[6859.53s -> 6861.29s]  Two is just the same thing but better.
[6861.85s -> 6866.06s]  It's just the exact same thing.
[6867.43s -> 6867.91s]  Yes.
[6867.91s -> 6868.71s]  Two is way better.
[6868.71s -> 6869.27s]  Just play it.
[6869.27s -> 6870.63s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[6870.63s -> 6871.99s]  I've seen a couple of no's but...
[6872.71s -> 6872.95s]  I've...
[6873.59s -> 6879.80s]  Sword and sandals two.
[6879.80s -> 6881.00s]  Emperors reign.
[6881.00s -> 6883.10s]  Why the different versions of this?
[6883.10s -> 6884.38s]  Swords and sandals two.
[6884.94s -> 6886.14s]  Why the different versions?
[6886.70s -> 6892.26s]  The game will start after this message.
[6892.26s -> 6892.74s]  What message?
[6893.46s -> 6898.23s]  Game brought to you by Third Sense.
[6898.87s -> 6899.19s]  This is the...
[6900.15s -> 6907.91s]  Okay, I have to zoom this in.
[6908.71s -> 6911.75s]  Graphics on high, obviously.
[6912.63s -> 6914.58s]  This is way too far.
[6914.58s -> 6915.54s]  I need to go in closer.
[6915.54s -> 6915.94s]  Hold on.
[6916.74s -> 6920.18s]  Okay.
[6920.18s -> 6920.66s]  There's a...
[6920.66s -> 6921.46s]  Why is there a chat?
[6922.10s -> 6931.98s]  I remember not being able to put games on high.
[6932.94s -> 6934.71s]  Every game had to be...
[6934.71s -> 6935.03s]  You had to...
[6935.03s -> 6937.19s]  I had to right click every game and put it all...
[6937.19s -> 6939.51s]  Put like the shockwave player down to low.
[6939.51s -> 6941.66s]  Because it would run at like two frames a second.
[6942.22s -> 6945.34s]  Okay.
[6945.34s -> 6945.90s]  That looks all right.
[6945.90s -> 6946.38s]  All right, let's go.
[6947.10s -> 6948.14s]  How to play.
[6948.14s -> 6951.10s]  Much has changed since swords and sandals one.
[6951.10s -> 6952.14s]  Apparently, chat.
[6952.70s -> 6954.89s]  But for those who have played the first game,
[6955.45s -> 6957.53s]  the basic premise is the same.
[6958.17s -> 6961.93s]  Create your gladiator and battle your way to fame and fortune.
[6961.93s -> 6964.57s]  Tooltips will guide you through the specifics of the game.
[6964.57s -> 6966.65s]  But the basic pattern of the game is as follows.
[6966.65s -> 6968.73s]  Create, build up your character,
[6969.29s -> 6971.45s]  buy weapons, armor, spells, and potions,
[6971.45s -> 6973.29s]  defeat gladiators to win experience and gold,
[6973.29s -> 6974.49s]  and then do it all over again.
[6974.49s -> 6979.98s]  Your ultimate aim is to defeat all the arena champions
[6979.98s -> 6981.66s]  and reign as champion yourself.
[6981.66s -> 6982.16s]  All right.
[6982.24s -> 6984.19s]  Great.
[6985.93s -> 6991.39s]  Become a member of the playaholics to save and load characters.
[6992.52s -> 6995.61s]  I'm not going to do that.
[6995.61s -> 6996.11s]  Name.
[7001.31s -> 7005.80s]  How about killer?
[7006.36s -> 7007.69s]  The killer.
[7010.27s -> 7010.77s]  Yeah.
[7011.47s -> 7012.11s]  The killer.
[7012.67s -> 7018.49s]  How about um...
[7018.49s -> 7018.99s]  Great.
[7023.64s -> 7024.68s]  Follow me.
[7024.68s -> 7025.32s]  Follow me.
[7026.76s -> 7027.26s]  Follow me.
[7027.80s -> 7028.30s]  Okay.
[7050.49s -> 7053.76s]  Well, I feel like this looks like a self-part character.
[7053.76s -> 7054.26s]  Okay.
[7054.72s -> 7056.43s]  Hairstyle.
[7056.43s -> 7057.31s]  I give him the...
[7057.31s -> 7059.23s]  Wait, I gotta find the German 985.
[7062.54s -> 7064.70s]  These all could be German 985.
[7064.70s -> 7065.74s]  I have different hair every day.
[7068.01s -> 7068.51s]  Um...
[7076.00s -> 7076.56s]  No.
[7076.56s -> 7077.44s]  How about just uh...
[7078.64s -> 7080.88s]  I don't know.
[7080.88s -> 7082.00s]  Should I do like the poop hair?
[7088.67s -> 7089.79s]  No, that's too wild.
[7093.66s -> 7094.94s]  Oh, Dragon Ball Z character.
[7094.94s -> 7095.44s]  Yeah.
[7095.44s -> 7096.94s]  It's gonna be one of the Dragon Ball Z characters.
[7096.94s -> 7098.54s]  The ones that like don't fight that much.
[7100.83s -> 7101.79s]  They're like smaller.
[7107.39s -> 7108.43s]  Piccolo fights all the time.
[7110.35s -> 7112.19s]  There's a little green guy that doesn't fight all the time.
[7112.19s -> 7112.69s]  Right?
[7113.15s -> 7117.20s]  Who's the little green guy that doesn't fight?
[7117.76s -> 7121.47s]  Krillin.
[7121.47s -> 7121.97s]  Yeah.
[7121.97s -> 7122.75s]  What color is his hair?
[7126.48s -> 7126.98s]  Dendy?
[7127.76s -> 7128.16s]  Yeah.
[7128.16s -> 7128.64s]  I don't know.
[7128.64s -> 7130.24s]  What color is Dendy's hair?
[7130.96s -> 7134.81s]  Do I have this right?
[7135.45s -> 7136.38s]  Hold on.
[7136.38s -> 7136.88s]  Dendy?
[7137.74s -> 7138.24s]  Dendy.
[7141.26s -> 7141.90s]  Okay, yeah.
[7141.90s -> 7142.54s]  It's this guy.
[7144.33s -> 7144.57s]  No.
[7144.57s -> 7145.93s]  Is it Dendy or is it Krillin?
[7147.08s -> 7149.13s]  Who has like the hair?
[7149.13s -> 7149.45s]  No.
[7149.45s -> 7150.41s]  Krillin does not.
[7150.41s -> 7151.05s]  Yeah, it's Dendy.
[7151.05s -> 7153.21s]  But is there a Dendy with like uh...
[7153.21s -> 7154.73s]  Is there a Dendy with like the hair?
[7159.69s -> 7160.09s]  No.
[7160.09s -> 7160.49s]  Okay.
[7160.49s -> 7161.29s]  I guess whatever.
[7163.80s -> 7164.44s]  I love that.
[7165.16s -> 7165.88s]  I like that.
[7165.88s -> 7166.38s]  Okay.
[7167.28s -> 7167.60s]  Okay.
[7167.60s -> 7169.28s]  Strength, agility, attack.
[7169.28s -> 7173.77s]  Let's just make my character, right?
[7173.77s -> 7175.55s]  Yeah.
[7175.55s -> 7175.87s]  Okay.
[7175.87s -> 7176.59s]  So, um...
[7177.55s -> 7178.03s]  The great...
[7178.03s -> 7180.59s]  The great star, underscore, once said
[7180.59s -> 7182.88s]  that if I had a character sheet in real life,
[7184.28s -> 7187.08s]  every single point would be in luck and charisma
[7187.08s -> 7190.01s]  and I'd have a zero in everything else.
[7190.01s -> 7190.73s]  So I...
[7190.73s -> 7192.81s]  I mean, I don't know how accurate that particularly is.
[7194.33s -> 7196.25s]  But I feel like I'll lose every match.
[7202.19s -> 7206.17s]  I wanted to be kind of strong.
[7206.81s -> 7208.27s]  I don't even know what these do.
[7208.27s -> 7208.75s]  Can I look?
[7209.31s -> 7210.73s]  Strength...
[7211.53s -> 7212.09s]  I definitely need...
[7212.81s -> 7213.05s]  Okay.
[7213.05s -> 7214.01s]  Stamina and vitality.
[7214.01s -> 7214.49s]  What's the difference?
[7217.29s -> 7220.97s]  Five strength, two agility, three attack.
[7220.97s -> 7232.91s]  Is that gonna work?
[7233.63s -> 7236.80s]  I don't think that's gonna do anything.
[7237.36s -> 7238.32s]  I'm gonna probably die.
[7238.88s -> 7241.53s]  Tool tips are at the bottom.
[7242.09s -> 7242.57s]  They are?
[7244.33s -> 7244.73s]  Oh, shit.
[7244.73s -> 7245.37s]  Okay.
[7245.37s -> 7248.32s]  Strength determines how much damage your character dishes out
[7248.32s -> 7249.76s]  and your skill with axes and clubs.
[7250.48s -> 7253.04s]  It also affects the height and weight of your character.
[7253.04s -> 7255.20s]  Stronger characters can push weaker characters further.
[7255.20s -> 7257.28s]  Okay, well, I mean, I'm not the biggest guy in the room,
[7257.28s -> 7258.96s]  but you know, I'm also not the smallest guy in the room,
[7258.96s -> 7260.64s]  but I can keep that at a one.
[7261.12s -> 7262.72s]  Agility represents your character's speed,
[7262.72s -> 7264.16s]  skill with swords and ranged weapons.
[7264.16s -> 7266.96s]  Faster characters can move in and out of combat more easily
[7266.96s -> 7269.36s]  and perform spectacular aerobatic leaps.
[7269.36s -> 7271.68s]  Well, with my kind of medical stuff recently,
[7271.68s -> 7273.20s]  I haven't been able to move around too much,
[7273.20s -> 7274.40s]  like that fast or that much.
[7274.40s -> 7276.83s]  So having some, you know, trouble layers
[7276.83s -> 7277.55s]  probably should be a one.
[7278.65s -> 7278.89s]  Attack.
[7278.89s -> 7280.73s]  Your attack is overall offensive weapon skill.
[7280.73s -> 7282.09s]  Gladiators with high attack scores
[7282.09s -> 7283.69s]  tend to hit their enemies more often.
[7283.69s -> 7285.61s]  Finding gaps in armor with masterful precision.
[7288.76s -> 7290.68s]  I have trouble like opening up Amazon packages
[7290.68s -> 7292.12s]  with like a pair of scissors.
[7292.12s -> 7294.54s]  I can never quite like cut the tape
[7294.54s -> 7296.27s]  and I end up just ripping it up.
[7296.27s -> 7297.39s]  I just grab the edges
[7297.39s -> 7299.71s]  and I just fucking pull as hard as I can
[7299.71s -> 7301.07s]  and the tape is starting to give,
[7301.07s -> 7302.19s]  but it hasn't given yet
[7302.19s -> 7303.79s]  and I pull as hard as I fucking can
[7303.79s -> 7305.15s]  until it just breaks.
[7305.15s -> 7306.89s]  So I probably wouldn't be very good at that either.
[7307.61s -> 7310.57s]  Defense is a vital part of protecting oneself in combat.
[7310.57s -> 7312.17s]  High defensive stat means you'll get hit less.
[7314.73s -> 7317.34s]  I mean, I do a lot of sitting.
[7317.34s -> 7317.90s]  I just sit here.
[7317.90s -> 7319.34s]  I mean, people could give you through
[7319.34s -> 7320.38s]  like a rock at my window right now.
[7320.38s -> 7321.26s]  It'd go hit me right in the head.
[7321.26s -> 7323.98s]  So I don't think I'd be very good at that either.
[7323.98s -> 7325.74s]  Your vitality represents your overall health.
[7326.86s -> 7327.66s]  That's one.
[7327.66s -> 7330.65s]  Charisma reflects your overall charm and likeability.
[7330.65s -> 7333.29s]  Characters with high charisma please the crowd.
[7333.29s -> 7335.45s]  Winning you more gold for winning fights.
[7335.45s -> 7338.09s]  Shopkeepers will lower their prices by 1%
[7338.09s -> 7341.23s]  for every charisma point you have.
[7341.23s -> 7343.55s]  I feel like I'm right at home here.
[7343.55s -> 7345.79s]  I feel like I can do this pretty well.
[7345.79s -> 7347.71s]  I feel like I have energy sometimes
[7347.71s -> 7350.03s]  and I can really speak to a crowd of people.
[7350.03s -> 7351.15s]  Are you guys ready?
[7351.15s -> 7353.23s]  Are you excited for German 985's
[7353.23s -> 7354.19s]  YouTube account?
[7354.19s -> 7355.60s]  I think it should be 10.
[7355.60s -> 7358.16s]  Stamina.
[7358.16s -> 7360.89s]  Every leap, every parry or hack you perform
[7360.89s -> 7363.21s]  in the area arena takes some of your energy.
[7363.21s -> 7365.60s]  I got some energy.
[7365.60s -> 7366.78s]  Well, no, I don't.
[7366.78s -> 7367.98s]  I stream for like four hours.
[7367.98s -> 7370.75s]  Um, what about magicka?
[7370.75s -> 7373.47s]  You cannot harness the power of magicka in your combats.
[7373.47s -> 7375.87s]  To cast magic spells and potions,
[7375.87s -> 7377.15s]  you'll need a high magicka.
[7377.15s -> 7380.76s]  Each magicka point you have also adds 1% resistance
[7380.76s -> 7382.99s]  to magical damage.
[7382.99s -> 7384.03s]  I don't know, man.
[7384.03s -> 7386.99s]  I kind of feel like, you know, how many times have I,
[7386.99s -> 7389.63s]  you know, like power, like total power.
[7390.73s -> 7393.72s]  I feel like I would be like one of those guys.
[7393.72s -> 7394.52s]  I would just open up.
[7394.52s -> 7396.20s]  I would go into the room with a big robe on
[7396.20s -> 7397.80s]  and I would just tell a bunch of jokes
[7397.80s -> 7400.64s]  and then I would zap everybody to death.
[7400.64s -> 7401.44s]  I think that would be me.
[7401.44s -> 7410.72s]  If I had a D&D character, that's who it would be.
[7410.72s -> 7411.92s]  You are a wizard.
[7411.92s -> 7414.96s]  Well, I don't know if it would be a wizard.
[7414.96s -> 7416.24s]  No, 10 charisma.
[7416.24s -> 7418.40s]  No, I could be like a magic user.
[7418.40s -> 7420.48s]  How could I not be a magic user?
[7420.48s -> 7420.88s]  Fine.
[7420.88s -> 7422.97s]  Nine charisma, two magic.
[7422.97s -> 7424.25s]  Well, this is going to be really funny.
[7424.25s -> 7425.45s]  Laugh out loud streamer joke.
[7425.45s -> 7427.92s]  I can't wait for like this to not go well at all
[7427.92s -> 7429.60s]  and I'm going to die in like the first arena
[7429.60s -> 7431.12s]  and like I'm going to fucking just quit the game
[7431.12s -> 7432.68s]  and we're going to move on.
[7432.68s -> 7434.92s]  Tholomew, yes, that was your name
[7434.92s -> 7438.78s]  but it seems and now here you are languishing in the darkness.
[7438.78s -> 7442.89s]  A forgotten prisoner in the emperor's dungeon.
[7442.89s -> 7444.73s]  Door opens and your eyes are blinded by the light.
[7444.73s -> 7446.97s]  A dark shape appears before you.
[7446.97s -> 7451.18s]  Soldiers, oh, you're in the basement.
[7451.18s -> 7452.38s]  Hey, you get up, worm.
[7452.94s -> 7455.74s]  It is time and boogers are flowing out of this guy's nose
[7455.74s -> 7457.58s]  and he has a plate of bacon in his hand
[7457.58s -> 7459.96s]  and he waves the bacon in front of your face.
[7459.96s -> 7462.24s]  Somebody who, if you know what that is,
[7462.24s -> 7464.56s]  holy shit, you are a long-term viewer.
[7464.56s -> 7466.96s]  It's the fucking copy paste book that I put into the chat
[7466.96s -> 7468.00s]  when I was writing that book.
[7468.00s -> 7470.56s]  And so in a frenzy of blood with a stench of fear,
[7470.56s -> 7472.00s]  your days as a gladiator begin.
[7472.00s -> 7479.31s]  Tholomew versus live from the dungeon.
[7479.31s -> 7480.51s]  Fearful prisoner.
[7480.51s -> 7484.73s]  Check out your opponent's armor.
[7484.73s -> 7485.69s]  Okay, stats.
[7485.69s -> 7489.47s]  This guy's got zero in everything.
[7489.47s -> 7495.04s]  Preview, okay, let's go.
[7495.04s -> 7497.47s]  Walk forward, jump forward.
[7500.44s -> 7504.38s]  Wait, is this like, is this how I can tell a joke?
[7504.38s -> 7507.26s]  Taunt enemy, press this to yell taunts at your enemy.
[7508.91s -> 7513.10s]  Just fucking made him angry.
[7513.10s -> 7514.30s]  Let me read these.
[7516.09s -> 7518.73s]  Jump backwards, press this leap to leap out of danger.
[7518.73s -> 7521.47s]  Jumping saps your energy quickly.
[7521.47s -> 7522.67s]  The height and distance of your jump
[7522.67s -> 7526.28s]  is determined by your agility.
[7526.28s -> 7528.28s]  Step away, useful when your health is low,
[7528.28s -> 7530.04s]  but be aware that jumping saps your energy.
[7530.04s -> 7532.68s]  Okay, so it's to get away.
[7532.68s -> 7534.28s]  Jump forward, jumping uses a lot of energy,
[7534.28s -> 7536.33s]  but it's faster, you get closer.
[7536.33s -> 7538.44s]  Or attack, charge enemy.
[7538.44s -> 7539.96s]  Press this to perform an aerobatic,
[7543.31s -> 7545.69s]  an aerobatic, like I'm flying,
[7545.69s -> 7546.73s]  leaping attack at your enemy.
[7547.69s -> 7549.77s]  I missed him.
[7552.03s -> 7553.63s]  How do you block somebody yelling at you?
[7553.63s -> 7554.59s]  Do you just close your ears?
[7554.59s -> 7557.12s]  Do you like plug your ears into your fingers?
[7557.12s -> 7561.84s]  All right, all right, all right, shove him.
[7561.84s -> 7563.60s]  Shove enemy, press this to push your opponent back
[7563.60s -> 7566.33s]  and give yourself some breathing space.
[7566.33s -> 7578.78s]  Power attack, holy shit, okay.
[7578.78s -> 7580.99s]  2,500 gold.
[7580.99s -> 7592.12s]  I leveled up, sick.
[7592.12s -> 7593.48s]  Day one, glorious freedom.
[7593.48s -> 7596.51s]  Your adventure starts here in town square.
[7596.51s -> 7597.95s]  Before you enter the arena,
[7597.95s -> 7600.28s]  you should visit the armory in the weaponsmith
[7600.28s -> 7602.44s]  and stock up on a weapon or some armor.
[7602.44s -> 7603.88s]  Click on one of the buildings nearby to enter
[7603.88s -> 7606.04s]  or click the call scene to jump straight into battle.
[7606.04s -> 7607.82s]  All right, let's go to the armory.
[7609.60s -> 7611.68s]  What sort of armor are you looking for?
[7611.68s -> 7613.79s]  The portrait on the right represents
[7613.79s -> 7615.47s]  the different types of armor you can buy.
[7616.03s -> 7618.35s]  Click an area on your body to see what's available.
[7618.35s -> 7622.92s]  Elmets protect you against critical hit damage
[7622.92s -> 7625.08s]  as well as contributing to your overall defense.
[7625.72s -> 7627.45s]  Shoulder guards increase the chance
[7627.45s -> 7629.53s]  of a charge attack succeeding
[7629.53s -> 7631.93s]  as well as contributing to your overall defense.
[7631.93s -> 7634.60s]  A breastplate converts a percentage of damage
[7634.60s -> 7636.44s]  taken into energy as well as contributing
[7636.44s -> 7637.88s]  to your overall defense.
[7637.88s -> 7640.24s]  A gauntlet increases the distance you can shove
[7640.24s -> 7641.68s]  your enemies as well as contributing
[7641.68s -> 7642.64s]  to your overall defense.
[7643.84s -> 7646.64s]  This thorough thigh guard protects against
[7646.64s -> 7647.92s]  critical hits as well as contributing
[7647.92s -> 7648.80s]  to your overall defense.
[7649.44s -> 7651.69s]  Shields make you hold them up in the air.
[7651.69s -> 7654.33s]  Shin guards you block soccer players.
[7654.33s -> 7656.24s]  Boots increase your movement speed
[7656.24s -> 7658.00s]  and contribute to your overall defense.
[7658.00s -> 7661.36s]  Okay, and then over here we have...
[7661.36s -> 7662.48s]  I'm not trying to be funny.
[7662.48s -> 7663.28s]  Stop, I'm not trying to be...

[7663.84s -> 7666.49s]  Okay, can I just say something?
[7666.49s -> 7667.69s]  If I go in...
[7667.69s -> 7669.98s]  If I do an English accent,
[7669.98s -> 7673.05s]  you guys just burn your computers.
[7673.05s -> 7675.45s]  It's like this huge triggering thing.
[7675.45s -> 7677.04s]  Like, hi everybody.

[7678.96s -> 7679.92s]  Break, break my...
[7679.92s -> 7681.60s]  Throw my computer in the fucking trash.
[7682.24s -> 7685.28s]  I could sit...
[7685.28s -> 7685.60s]  I could...
[7685.60s -> 7686.88s]  I could sit here and go like this.
[7691.44s -> 7692.88s]  Yes, yes, do it again.
[7692.88s -> 7693.52s]  Yes.
[7693.52s -> 7695.34s]  Hi everybody.
[7695.34s -> 7696.94s]  I'm just talking with a different accent.
[7699.90s -> 7702.08s]  My whole body's on fire.
[7702.08s -> 7709.29s]  Just use it, cover yourself in a blanket
[7709.29s -> 7710.65s]  and like roll around your room.
[7711.45s -> 7714.76s]  All right, what do I want to do?
[7715.64s -> 7716.75s]  Helmet?
[7716.75s -> 7717.95s]  Ooh, it's a leather helmet.
[7718.83s -> 7720.03s]  Anything but the accent.
[7726.01s -> 7732.57s]  How much is it?
[7732.57s -> 7733.07s]  $1,200?
[7733.93s -> 7734.65s]  If you have enough gold,
[7734.65s -> 7736.25s]  you can buy this item by clicking the tick button
[7736.25s -> 7738.09s]  and it will automatically place on your character.
[7738.09s -> 7739.13s]  Have you changed your mind?
[7739.13s -> 7740.81s]  I wasn't supposed to scream today.
[7740.81s -> 7741.45s]  What the fuck?
[7741.45s -> 7742.41s]  I'm not supposed to be yelling.
[7742.41s -> 7743.05s]  Listen to this now.
[7743.05s -> 7743.85s]  I'm getting a little...
[7743.85s -> 7745.13s]  I'm going to have to take another two days off.
[7746.00s -> 7747.44s]  No, the game awards is tomorrow.
[7747.44s -> 7748.08s]  I can't miss it.
[7753.93s -> 7756.09s]  Okay, how do I get the tooltips off for a second?
[7756.09s -> 7758.88s]  30% crit protection adds 20 to your armor.
[7759.44s -> 7762.38s]  Acquired gladiator level.
[7762.38s -> 7763.26s]  It's like Bane.
[7763.26s -> 7763.82s]  When I used to...
[7763.82s -> 7764.46s]  Remember Bane?
[7765.10s -> 7766.14s]  It would go like this,
[7766.14s -> 7767.50s]  and all of a sudden everybody's...
[7767.50s -> 7768.78s]  Oh, everybody's...
[7768.78s -> 7778.40s]  All their entrails would come out.
[7778.40s -> 7779.44s]  Uh, I don't want that.
[7779.44s -> 7780.40s]  I should get a weapon.
[7781.60s -> 7782.49s]  What the fuck?
[7783.05s -> 7784.00s]  What's going on?
[7789.21s -> 7790.41s]  Louis D. Lungeville,
[7790.41s -> 7791.05s]  master at arms.
[7791.05s -> 7792.01s]  Can I interest you in a weapon?
[7793.00s -> 7795.08s]  Slashing weapons are truly the weapon of the gentleman.
[7795.08s -> 7796.20s]  They require high agility.
[7797.00s -> 7799.96s]  What's the weapon of the charisma?
[7799.96s -> 7800.68s]  A microphone?
[7801.93s -> 7804.17s]  Hacking weapons are great for slicing.
[7804.17s -> 7805.29s]  They require high strength.
[7805.93s -> 7808.09s]  High strength?
[7811.45s -> 7812.33s]  Okay, I need, um...
[7812.33s -> 7813.93s]  I need like a staff.
[7813.93s -> 7814.25s]  I have...

[7818.99s -> 7819.87s]  Why does everybody get so mad?
[7819.87s -> 7819.95s]  I...
[7819.95s -> 7820.11s]  What?
[7820.11s -> 7821.87s]  Did I do an accent to these people?
[7823.32s -> 7823.64s]  Sorry.
[7824.51s -> 7826.35s]  I did an English accent for five seconds.

[7850.14s -> 7851.60s]  Burn your...
[7851.60s -> 7852.56s]  A flame weapon?
[7852.56s -> 7853.28s]  I don't have a weapon.
[7853.84s -> 7856.73s]  I could put it on a rusty knife.
[7862.96s -> 7863.28s]  What?
[7864.14s -> 7864.62s]  Nightfall.
[7864.62s -> 7866.46s]  The hours late and the town quiets.
[7866.46s -> 7867.66s]  You find yourself growing weary.
[7867.66s -> 7869.66s]  Will you brave the streets to spend some gold?
[7869.66s -> 7870.62s]  I didn't buy anything.
[7872.56s -> 7874.00s]  Uh, I need to go to bed.
[7874.56s -> 7877.66s]  You make your way to the Cozy Nook,
[7877.66s -> 7879.68s]  a tavern in the merchant's quarter.
[7879.68s -> 7881.36s]  Paying the innkeeper 250 gold pieces,
[7881.36s -> 7882.56s]  you're shown to a comfortable room
[7882.56s -> 7884.16s]  with a view of the forest to the east.
[7884.72s -> 7886.16s]  Just leave this peaceful and awake feeling
[7886.16s -> 7887.52s]  ready to take the world again.
[7887.52s -> 7891.29s]  I wasted time browsing around.
[7891.29s -> 7891.53s]  Okay.
[7893.55s -> 7893.95s]  I need...
[7894.67s -> 7896.35s]  I need a weapon or something.
[7896.35s -> 7897.23s]  I should buy something.
[7897.79s -> 7901.85s]  I buy, like, a dagger and...
[7902.65s -> 7903.45s]  Enchant it?
[7903.45s -> 7906.88s]  Let's just go.
[7906.88s -> 7907.68s]  Whatever.

[7932.60s -> 7932.92s]  He's a...
[7936.83s -> 7938.84s]  What do I do to him?
[7938.84s -> 7940.20s]  Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go.

[7974.30s -> 7974.86s]  Weaponsmith.
[7975.42s -> 7977.96s]  I need just something to enchant.
[7978.52s -> 7984.43s]  No, should I get Gale?
[7984.43s -> 7985.31s]  I think I'm gonna get Gale.
[7989.39s -> 7990.11s]  Gale.
[7990.11s -> 7991.15s]  37, 40.
[7991.15s -> 7991.87s]  Shit.
[7991.87s -> 7999.92s]  I'm gonna enchant my weapon with flame.

[8012.57s -> 8014.67s]  It costs zero gold.
[8015.23s -> 8017.69s]  Oh, it's range only?
[8018.41s -> 8020.06s]  Don't waste the money.
[8022.06s -> 8024.38s]  What's in the church?
[8024.38s -> 8025.42s]  Welcome, you will find peace here.
[8025.42s -> 8027.10s]  Do you require the church's aid and your soul saved?
[8027.10s -> 8028.54s]  I guess you can just buy potions.
[8028.54s -> 8046.08s]  I'm just like juggling.
[8050.33s -> 8051.61s]  The crowd is bored.
[8067.26s -> 8069.04s]  Oh, shit.

[8224.04s -> 8231.08s]  Okay, go to the arena.
[8231.64s -> 8233.55s]  It's time for the tournament.
[8233.55s -> 8235.50s]  Once you enter a tournament,
[8235.50s -> 8237.58s]  you cannot return to the town until you are victorious.
[8237.58s -> 8239.10s]  To lose a fight is death.
[8239.74s -> 8242.80s]  Okay.

[8260.48s -> 8263.28s]  I'm four, I'm two levels higher than Poseidon.
[8276.32s -> 8277.36s]  I'm gonna get the crowd behind me.

[8280.28s -> 8281.48s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8281.48s -> 8284.65s]  Oh, I'm fine, fine, fine.
[8284.65s -> 8285.13s]  Interested?

[8293.60s -> 8294.48s]  Enthusiastic.
[8295.04s -> 8296.08s]  All right, now scream at him.
[8296.80s -> 8303.61s]  What just happened?
[8304.25s -> 8308.06s]  Come on.
[8308.06s -> 8317.31s]  He fell, he fell, he fell.
[8317.31s -> 8317.71s]  That was funny.
[8317.71s -> 8318.43s]  The crowd liked that.
[8318.43s -> 8318.99s]  Back up.
[8318.99s -> 8331.52s]  He's cutting my limbs off.
[8336.38s -> 8337.02s]  I won.
[8337.02s -> 8342.89s]  Oh, shit.
[8342.89s -> 8343.21s]  Nice.
[8343.21s -> 8343.45s]  Okay.
[8350.78s -> 8354.44s]  I'm blocking that shit.
[8361.60s -> 8362.64s]  Rest and heal.
[8363.28s -> 8389.58s]  Oh, am I hitting him with a sandwich?
[8389.58s -> 8390.62s]  I don't even have a weapon.
[8400.12s -> 8400.60s]  Come on.
[8402.57s -> 8403.05s]  There it is.
[8410.24s -> 8410.48s]  What?
[8412.20s -> 8413.56s]  How are you blocking this?
[8413.56s -> 8414.44s]  Ow, that hurt.
[8424.16s -> 8424.88s]  Fuck, come on.
[8430.16s -> 8431.36s]  Back up, back up, back up, back up.

[8471.72s -> 8474.04s]  All right, I want to play a real one.
[8474.04s -> 8475.16s]  Let me play a real one.
[8478.97s -> 8480.41s]  Play again, play again, play again, play again.
[8480.41s -> 8481.29s]  All right, I'm going to do a real one.
[8481.29s -> 8481.77s]  I'm going to do a real one.
[8481.77s -> 8483.05s]  I'm going to do a real one.
[8483.05s -> 8493.36s]  I don't know.
[8493.36s -> 8493.92s]  I don't know.
[8493.92s -> 8494.40s]  I don't know.

[8499.93s -> 8500.73s]  This guy, okay.
[8502.78s -> 8510.99s]  Uh, is it a guy from Star Fox?
[8511.55s -> 8513.96s]  Is it a guy from Star Fox?
[8514.52s -> 8519.08s]  Pigma.
[8519.08s -> 8527.34s]  Okay, I'm going to do this for real.
[8528.76s -> 8529.56s]  I want strength.
[8529.56s -> 8530.20s]  I want attack.
[8531.64s -> 8532.28s]  Get rid of the magic.
[8532.28s -> 8532.76s]  I don't care.
[8532.76s -> 8533.16s]  Attack.
[8534.54s -> 8535.10s]  Vitality.
[8535.10s -> 8535.98s]  Agility.
[8535.98s -> 8536.38s]  Let's go.
[8536.94s -> 8537.34s]  Ow.
[8539.68s -> 8540.32s]  Pigma.
[8541.52s -> 8542.56s]  No, don't you dare.
[8546.04s -> 8546.60s]  Oh, I'll do it.
[8550.68s -> 8551.72s]  That's worse noise contender.
[8551.72s -> 8552.52s]  Fuck, I'm in trouble.
[8553.08s -> 8553.88s]  I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble.
[8554.28s -> 8555.56s]  That was like worse noise contender.
[8556.20s -> 8557.80s]  No, by the way, it's too late.
[8557.80s -> 8558.92s]  You know how December is the month,
[8558.92s -> 8560.04s]  like halfway through December?
[8562.96s -> 8564.00s]  You can't nominate that anymore
[8564.00s -> 8565.68s]  because we're like too far in December.
[8565.68s -> 8575.52s]  All right, let's just,
[8575.52s -> 8576.40s]  let's smoke this guy.
[8593.85s -> 8594.73s]  Low charisma.
[8594.73s -> 8595.29s]  I know.
[8595.29s -> 8595.93s]  What the fuck?
[8596.65s -> 8602.16s]  What are they saying?
[8606.28s -> 8607.00s]  Gladiator.
[8607.00s -> 8607.96s]  Gladiator's off.
[8607.96s -> 8608.92s]  Gladiator's off.
[8608.92s -> 8609.96s]  Gladiator's off.
[8609.96s -> 8610.84s]  Gladiator's off.
[8611.72s -> 8613.29s]  Gladiator's off.
[8613.29s -> 8614.17s]  I hit Gladiator's off.
[8614.81s -> 8615.29s]  Gladiator's off.
[8615.29s -> 8616.17s]  Gladiator's off.
[8617.21s -> 8617.93s]  I don't know.
[8617.93s -> 8619.61s]  All right, give me a dagger.
[8620.25s -> 8626.43s]  Graded nine slashing damage.
[8627.31s -> 8627.87s]  I'll take it.
[8628.43s -> 8629.72s]  Let's go.
[8630.44s -> 8631.96s]  Start stabbing.
[8631.96s -> 8636.01s]  It's time for a duel.
[8636.81s -> 8638.67s]  Here we go.
[8638.67s -> 8639.47s]  Scream.
[8639.47s -> 8640.19s]  Get a man.
[8640.19s -> 8640.75s]  What's that club?
[8640.75s -> 8641.79s]  He's gonna enchant a club.
[8648.64s -> 8648.88s]  What?
[8649.60s -> 8659.26s]  What the fuck just happened?
[8659.98s -> 8664.56s]  How much money is this?
[8664.56s -> 8665.44s]  I can't even afford this.
[8666.56s -> 8668.09s]  Get armor, you idiot.
[8668.97s -> 8669.21s]  I will.
[8683.13s -> 8683.77s]  We're good.
[8683.77s -> 8688.38s]  Okay, now I'm gonna get armor.
[8689.02s -> 8690.97s]  Gladiator's off.
[8690.97s -> 8691.93s]  Gladiator's off.
[8691.93s -> 8693.56s]  Gladiator's off.
[8693.56s -> 8694.76s]  Gladiator's off.
[8694.76s -> 8695.08s]  All right.
[8699.21s -> 8700.49s]  All right, strength and attack.
[8705.48s -> 8706.36s]  Wash your ears.
[8708.17s -> 8709.13s]  Wash your ears?
[8709.13s -> 8709.85s]  They're filthy.
[8710.57s -> 8713.69s]  Shoulder guards.
[8714.41s -> 8714.97s]  Okay.
[8714.97s -> 8715.69s]  All right.
[8715.69s -> 8722.20s]  I need a better weapon though.
[8722.20s -> 8722.52s]  All right.
[8722.52s -> 8723.88s]  I'm gonna try to make money for a weapon.
[8730.30s -> 8731.18s]  All right, let's get in closer.
[8732.97s -> 8733.37s]  Closer.
[8735.08s -> 8735.40s]  Nice.
[8735.40s -> 8735.80s]  Good trick.
[8744.60s -> 8745.80s]  What can I get for a weapon?
[8747.96s -> 8748.76s]  High agility.
[8749.32s -> 8750.20s]  High strength.
[8750.20s -> 8750.68s]  Okay.
[8750.68s -> 8751.88s]  So this is 22.
[8752.68s -> 8753.63s]  28.
[8753.63s -> 8754.59s]  All right, let's get a few more.
[8754.59s -> 8755.15s]  We'll get an axe.
[8757.34s -> 8765.74s]  All right, get in.
[8770.41s -> 8771.04s]  Shit.
[8771.04s -> 8772.24s]  See, I blocked it.
[8772.24s -> 8772.56s]  Power.
[8774.46s -> 8774.78s]  Power.
[8778.68s -> 8779.00s]  Charge.
[8781.37s -> 8782.65s]  What the fuck, dude?
[8783.53s -> 8794.14s]  God damn it.
[8794.14s -> 8799.16s]  The child in the mill.
[8799.16s -> 8801.00s]  You are approached by a frantic woman.
[8801.00s -> 8801.64s]  Please help me.
[8801.64s -> 8803.88s]  My only child was playing in the old mill
[8803.88s -> 8806.12s]  and is trapped under some heavy wooden blocks.
[8806.12s -> 8807.08s]  I cannot free him.
[8807.64s -> 8809.64s]  You help the rescue of the child or decline and get about...
[8809.64s -> 8810.68s]  Yeah, let's rescue the child.
[8811.48s -> 8812.84s]  You follow the woman to the mill
[8812.84s -> 8814.44s]  and get to work with the rescue effort.
[8814.44s -> 8816.36s]  Although it takes an hour and most of your strength,
[8816.36s -> 8817.48s]  eventually the child is free.
[8818.04s -> 8819.32s]  You become a hero.
[8819.32s -> 8820.76s]  In both the mother and the child's eyes,
[8820.76s -> 8822.44s]  you gain three charisma points.
[8823.16s -> 8823.98s]  Oh, shit.
[8823.98s -> 8826.97s]  Nice.
[8826.97s -> 8828.49s]  I have to win a battle.
[8828.49s -> 8830.64s]  I have no money to buy anything.
[8830.64s -> 8831.28s]  All right, duel.
[8831.28s -> 8831.68s]  Come on.
[8832.24s -> 8833.42s]  What do you have?
[8834.64s -> 8836.48s]  Shin guards and a shoulder guard.
[8836.48s -> 8836.72s]  Okay.
[8837.44s -> 8840.04s]  Four to 16.
[8840.04s -> 8841.00s]  You guys got a cleaver.
[8841.64s -> 8846.56s]  Hey, Dallas O'Leary is the patron saint.
[8846.56s -> 8847.12s]  I'm gonna lose.
[8847.12s -> 8847.92s]  Let's get in.
[8847.92s -> 8852.75s]  Rest.
[8862.67s -> 8867.18s]  Okay, he fell.
[8867.18s -> 8868.14s]  Now we go in.
[8869.58s -> 8870.14s]  Normal.
[8870.14s -> 8870.62s]  Good.
[8870.62s -> 8872.12s]  All right.
[8872.12s -> 8872.44s]  All right.
[8872.44s -> 8872.76s]  Okay.
[8872.76s -> 8873.16s]  All right.
[8873.16s -> 8873.64s]  Back it up.
[8873.64s -> 8874.12s]  Back it up.
[8874.12s -> 8875.32s]  Rest and heal.
[8875.32s -> 8876.76s]  Get the energy back.
[8876.76s -> 8877.32s]  Back it up again.
[8878.12s -> 8878.68s]  Lunge.
[8883.21s -> 8883.69s]  Shit.
[8883.69s -> 8884.49s]  Okay, we're fine.
[8885.69s -> 8886.49s]  All right.
[8886.49s -> 8892.28s]  What should I put this into?
[8892.28s -> 8893.08s]  Seriously.
[8893.08s -> 8894.04s]  Attack?
[8894.04s -> 8895.96s]  Let me look at this again.
[8896.76s -> 8898.04s]  Vitality?
[8898.44s -> 8906.20s]  Yeah.
[8906.20s -> 8906.84s]  Okay.
[8906.84s -> 8910.33s]  How much money do I have now?
[8910.33s -> 8913.55s]  Enough for an axe?
[8914.19s -> 8914.91s]  17.
[8914.91s -> 8915.15s]  Nope.
[8915.15s -> 8916.60s]  I don't have enough money.
[8916.84s -> 8917.08s]  Nope.
[8917.08s -> 8917.96s]  I don't have enough for an axe.
[8919.32s -> 8920.12s]  I have to win another...
[8920.12s -> 8921.00s]  I have to win another one.
[8922.28s -> 8923.96s]  Oh, god damn it.
[8923.96s -> 8927.34s]  I'm gonna have to do this again.
[8927.34s -> 8928.38s]  Can I sell something?
[8928.94s -> 8936.17s]  I've got to get a...
[8937.29s -> 8940.12s]  Go to the church and save the game?
[8944.59s -> 8945.15s]  Fuck.
[8945.15s -> 8953.26s]  Are the graphics on medium?
[8953.26s -> 8953.50s]  Yeah.
[8953.50s -> 8954.06s]  What the hell?
[8956.83s -> 8958.03s]  Save your character.
[8958.03s -> 8958.43s]  Oh, shit.
[8958.43s -> 8958.91s]  There we go.
[8961.18s -> 8961.82s]  Wait.
[8961.82s -> 8962.22s]  Do you want...
[8962.22s -> 8964.30s]  The church can save your soul for 40 gold.
[8964.30s -> 8965.90s]  Do I want playaholics to load?
[8965.90s -> 8966.62s]  Oh my god.
[8974.52s -> 8975.24s]  I just have to win.
[8975.80s -> 8977.47s]  I'm not gonna be able to win.
[8977.47s -> 8978.83s]  I bought the wrong weapon.
[8982.12s -> 8984.24s]  Can I afford any armor?
[8984.96s -> 8985.92s]  What about a shield?
[8985.92s -> 8987.12s]  Or just even just a little one?
[8987.12s -> 8987.84s]  Nope.
[8987.84s -> 8991.63s]  What about gauntlets?
[8992.51s -> 8993.79s]  I can afford gauntlets.
[8995.64s -> 8996.28s]  Want any armor?
[8996.84s -> 8999.21s]  What is your armor?

[9013.92s -> 9014.80s]  I've got more armor.
[9014.80s -> 9016.08s]  And I just have to kill him.
[9019.20s -> 9019.92s]  Oh.
[9019.92s -> 9021.04s]  Good start.
[9021.04s -> 9021.44s]  All right.
[9021.44s -> 9021.76s]  Power.
[9024.97s -> 9025.29s]  Lunch.

[9039.07s -> 9039.63s]  Okay.
[9039.63s -> 9039.95s]  Shit.
[9039.95s -> 9040.59s]  I'm not gonna win.
[9041.39s -> 9043.36s]  He's got 18 armor.
[9043.36s -> 9044.16s]  He's got an axe.
[9044.16s -> 9045.28s]  He's got an enchanted axe.
[9050.11s -> 9051.12s]  Come on.
[9051.12s -> 9052.08s]  Let me get lucky here.
[9056.48s -> 9056.96s]  Don't you...
[9056.96s -> 9057.60s]  Don't...
[9057.60s -> 9057.68s]  You...
[9057.68s -> 9058.32s]  Don't pull...
[9058.32s -> 9058.96s]  Get over here.
[9058.96s -> 9059.52s]  Get over here.
[9059.52s -> 9060.16s]  Don't pull that out.
[9062.78s -> 9063.31s]  Yeah.
[9063.31s -> 9063.79s]  I was gonna say.
[9063.79s -> 9064.35s]  Give me a break.
[9065.39s -> 9066.11s]  Good.
[9066.11s -> 9066.59s]  Lunch again.
[9068.16s -> 9068.72s]  Back it up.
[9068.72s -> 9070.52s]  Sleep.
[9070.52s -> 9070.84s]  Lunch.
[9073.53s -> 9074.41s]  What happened?
[9074.41s -> 9074.73s]  Power.
[9077.96s -> 9078.52s]  Good.
[9078.52s -> 9081.64s]  Okay.
[9081.64s -> 9082.04s]  All right.
[9082.04s -> 9082.84s]  All right.

[9113.34s -> 9113.66s]  Back up.
[9117.85s -> 9119.37s]  His energy is so much higher than mine.
[9120.33s -> 9120.57s]  Fine.
[9120.57s -> 9120.89s]  That's okay.
[9123.07s -> 9123.47s]  Good.
[9123.47s -> 9123.79s]  Good.
[9125.96s -> 9126.60s]  Fuck.
[9126.60s -> 9127.40s]  No.

[9135.84s -> 9136.88s]  75 stamina pot.
[9136.88s -> 9137.04s]  Huh?
[9137.04s -> 9137.28s]  Wait.
[9137.28s -> 9138.08s]  I didn't have the stamina pot.
[9138.08s -> 9138.40s]  What?
[9140.12s -> 9141.88s]  What?
[9141.88s -> 9144.44s]  What?

[9170.96s -> 9171.92s]  Zero skill points.
[9171.92s -> 9172.16s]  What?
[9194.73s -> 9197.15s]  Okay.
[9197.15s -> 9197.39s]  Go.

[9210.73s -> 9211.53s]  Not going to happen again.
[9212.33s -> 9214.73s]  Here we go.
[9214.73s -> 9216.41s]  I'm going to buy this cleaver.
[9216.41s -> 9217.13s]  Done.
[9217.13s -> 9218.25s]  Now I'm going to win.
[9218.25s -> 9218.73s]  Watch this.
[9226.76s -> 9241.77s]  Okay.
[9275.58s -> 9277.02s]  What the heck?
[9289.37s -> 9289.61s]  Yes.
[9289.61s -> 9289.93s]  Okay.
[9289.93s -> 9290.17s]  All right.
[9290.17s -> 9290.41s]  We're good.
[9290.41s -> 9290.73s]  We're good.
[9290.73s -> 9290.97s]  We're good.
[9290.97s -> 9293.64s]  We're good.
[9293.64s -> 9294.12s]  Strength.
[9297.02s -> 9298.44s]  Okay.
[9298.44s -> 9300.28s]  Now I'm going to go to the armory.
[9301.08s -> 9302.68s]  I'm going to buy some potions and shit too.
[9303.32s -> 9307.44s]  I need magicka of four.
[9308.00s -> 9308.80s]  Oh, shit.
[9308.80s -> 9309.20s]  I can't.
[9310.40s -> 9312.27s]  Get stamina and defense.
[9312.27s -> 9312.83s]  I will soon.
[9313.63s -> 9314.43s]  How much money do I have?
[9314.99s -> 9316.00s]  Okay.
[9316.00s -> 9318.40s]  I need 2800.
[9325.05s -> 9325.69s]  Elmit.
[9325.69s -> 9328.20s]  I can't afford any of this stuff.
[9329.08s -> 9329.80s]  Shoulder guards.
[9330.44s -> 9332.00s]  I can't afford this.
[9332.32s -> 9333.28s]  At least I can afford these.
[9333.28s -> 9333.68s]  That's fine.
[9334.24s -> 9336.14s]  Okay.
[9336.78s -> 9337.58s]  Back to it.
[9337.58s -> 9337.90s]  Duel.
[9338.62s -> 9343.76s]  Buy boots.
[9343.76s -> 9344.16s]  I will.
[9354.16s -> 9355.28s]  One guy.
[9355.28s -> 9356.56s]  One guy's laughing.
[9361.39s -> 9362.75s]  What the fuck, dude?
[9362.75s -> 9363.31s]  I wasn't even...
[9368.62s -> 9372.22s]  One guy in the audience just screwed everything up so bad.
[9375.12s -> 9376.40s]  No, don't.
[9376.40s -> 9376.88s]  What happened?
[9376.88s -> 9377.68s]  I'm on fire.
[9377.68s -> 9379.20s]  This character just sucks.
[9379.20s -> 9379.84s]  I suck.
[9395.00s -> 9395.32s]  Hi.
[9398.54s -> 9403.18s]  What?
[9403.18s -> 9404.54s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[9404.54s -> 9407.34s]  The guy has a loincloth on and that's it.
[9409.21s -> 9410.57s]  I have no fucking money.
[9410.57s -> 9411.21s]  I'm over.
[9412.01s -> 9420.06s]  I need stamina.
[9420.62s -> 9421.82s]  God damn it, man.
[9422.70s -> 9423.74s]  It's asleep over here.
[9432.65s -> 9437.12s]  Why does everybody have magic fucking items?
[9437.84s -> 9439.36s]  Why does everybody have magical shit?
[9440.00s -> 9451.31s]  I have no money.
[9451.31s -> 9452.03s]  God damn it.
[9452.03s -> 9454.99s]  I thought I was going to be able to do like a basic strength build.
[9457.05s -> 9458.09s]  Charisma was better.
[9459.63s -> 9461.23s]  You did best on the joke character.
[9461.95s -> 9462.43s]  I know.
[9462.43s -> 9463.39s]  Oh, my God.
[9463.39s -> 9464.91s]  That's so frustrating.
[9464.91s -> 9465.55s]  Why?
[9465.55s -> 9466.67s]  Why is it possible?
[9495.36s -> 9497.29s]  Why can't I hit anybody?
[9497.29s -> 9498.65s]  Why can't I hit anybody?
[9556.68s -> 9557.08s]  All right.
[9557.08s -> 9558.76s]  So give me some stamina.
[9560.06s -> 9561.34s]  Give me some defense.
[9563.02s -> 9564.06s]  Give me some attack.
[9565.18s -> 9565.90s]  223.
[9567.18s -> 9567.58s]  Attack.
[9568.65s -> 9569.29s]  Reattack.
[9569.85s -> 9576.81s]  This is good.
[9578.67s -> 9578.99s]  Okay.
[9581.96s -> 9582.20s]  Go.
[9590.24s -> 9590.80s]  Here we go.
[9590.80s -> 9591.68s]  Let's kill this guy.
[9594.01s -> 9595.61s]  Oh, four strength, four stamina.
[9597.61s -> 9603.42s]  Okay.
[9603.98s -> 9604.54s]  So I should do...
[9605.58s -> 9606.14s]  No, no.
[9606.14s -> 9606.46s]  Go back.
[9606.46s -> 9607.42s]  How do I take that back?
[9607.42s -> 9608.30s]  Why is it not a minus?
[9610.51s -> 9611.31s]  This should be a minus.
[9611.31s -> 9612.19s]  Why is it not a minus?
[9612.91s -> 9626.89s]  I'm ready.
[9627.53s -> 9630.54s]  I'm going into this shop and we're going to buy...
[9631.66s -> 9635.42s]  I'm going to get the bigger axe because I'm going to just watch this shit.
[9635.42s -> 9636.06s]  You ready for this?
[9636.70s -> 9637.18s]  Watch this.
[9638.14s -> 9639.90s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[9639.90s -> 9641.90s]  Fair maiden, while leaving the arena,
[9641.90s -> 9645.18s]  you spot a pretty girl smiling at you as she spends some time as you know a lady.
[9645.18s -> 9648.14s]  You pluck up the courage to ask her for a meal.
[9648.14s -> 9650.14s]  Will you be extravagant or just take her out for beers?
[9650.78s -> 9652.14s]  1,500 gold.
[9652.86s -> 9657.63s]  You accept your offer and that night you meet at one of the finest restaurants in town.
[9658.19s -> 9658.99s]  The meal is splendid.
[9658.99s -> 9660.35s]  The conversation flows and soon enough,
[9661.15s -> 9663.07s]  the next morning the maiden gives you a kiss and a rose.
[9663.07s -> 9664.11s]  You shall be her champion.
[9664.75s -> 9666.19s]  You got two stamina points.
[9667.26s -> 9668.22s]  1,500 gold.
[9668.22s -> 9669.02s]  It was not worth it.
[9670.35s -> 9674.19s]  We just got monster subs from Mr. Sark.
[9676.03s -> 9677.87s]  Sark, thanks for the 20 community subs.
[9678.67s -> 9681.47s]  That's the Mr. Sark, streamer on Twitch.
[9682.19s -> 9684.35s]  One of the old school YouTubers.
[9686.14s -> 9687.02s]  Very, very funny guy.
[9687.02s -> 9691.18s]  Follow him right now or I'm going to be extraordinarily upset with you.
[9691.18s -> 9698.70s]  By the way, I've heard that Mr. Sark is the new Drew Crew ambassador from what I heard.
[9700.06s -> 9702.67s]  Hey, Sark, they're yours now.
[9704.48s -> 9705.52s]  They're yours now.
[9709.96s -> 9714.64s]  No, but thanks though.
[9714.64s -> 9716.00s]  Seriously, why does it keep going to medium?
[9717.58s -> 9719.74s]  I haven't gone pee or had water the whole day.
[9720.62s -> 9721.66s]  So let me just do that real quick.
[9721.66s -> 9722.22s]  I'll be right back.
[9722.86s -> 9728.48s]  Let's take a look at some art.
[10031.02s -> 10033.85s]  I just drank so much water.
[10033.85s -> 10034.89s]  That's a lot.
[10034.89s -> 10036.35s]  How's the art looking?
[10036.35s -> 10036.91s]  Looks good.
[10038.72s -> 10039.20s]  That's good.
[10039.20s -> 10039.60s]  Look at that.
[10039.60s -> 10040.56s]  Will you lower it to auto?
[10042.80s -> 10046.32s]  So funny, whenever I talk to the vet,
[10047.45s -> 10048.17s]  I can't help it.
[10048.17s -> 10051.69s]  Every time I say auto's name, I have to say auto.
[10051.69s -> 10053.92s]  So it's like, oh yeah, just call him.
[10053.92s -> 10055.28s]  Yeah, auto has an appointment.
[10055.28s -> 10058.40s]  Yeah, I'm just calling to make an appointment for my dog, auto.
[10058.96s -> 10063.77s]  What's his name?
[10063.77s -> 10064.57s]  Oh, it's auto.
[10066.16s -> 10066.40s]  Sorry.
[10066.40s -> 10066.80s]  Excuse me.
[10066.80s -> 10068.56s]  I mean, auto.
[10068.56s -> 10073.77s]  Sark says sexy art presentation too.
[10073.77s -> 10074.57s]  Sick transitions.
[10074.57s -> 10078.38s]  Yeah, it was made by a couple of people in the community.
[10078.38s -> 10081.76s]  So Yen Wen Len and Lazy Luke.
[10083.79s -> 10084.19s]  It's real.
[10084.19s -> 10088.91s]  Oh, can you imagine?
[10088.91s -> 10090.75s]  Look at that fucking booty.
[10091.47s -> 10094.99s]  I've really leaned into that, I've noticed.
[10095.71s -> 10100.91s]  I've really leaned into that.
[10100.91s -> 10101.55s]  I don't know why.
[10101.55s -> 10104.16s]  I just have whatever.
[10104.16s -> 10104.80s]  Yeah, why?
[10104.80s -> 10105.68s]  I don't know.
[10105.68s -> 10106.80s]  Look, I thought it was fun.
[10107.44s -> 10108.16s]  It's funny.
[10108.16s -> 10108.64s]  It's fun.
[10108.64s -> 10109.60s]  It was fun, okay?
[10109.60s -> 10111.12s]  It's a funny, fun thing.
[10111.12s -> 10111.76s]  I don't care.
[10112.40s -> 10117.15s]  If you do a big zoom in of my ass, it doesn't bother me.
[10117.15s -> 10118.48s]  It just doesn't.
[10120.12s -> 10126.36s]  If you have a zoomed in picture of my ass cheeks, I don't care.
[10127.08s -> 10129.32s]  I'm just like, all right, what are you doing?
[10129.32s -> 10132.76s]  But I don't give a shit.
[10132.76s -> 10135.87s]  I look good for my age.
[10135.87s -> 10136.59s]  I'm 35.
[10138.09s -> 10140.65s]  Look, there's art that says it too.
[10142.51s -> 10143.71s]  No, you don't think I know?
[10143.71s -> 10145.31s]  You don't think I know what I got going on down there?
[10153.28s -> 10154.32s]  Get it off.
[10154.32s -> 10154.88s]  Get it off.
[10154.88s -> 10155.44s]  Never mind.
[10155.44s -> 10156.00s]  Never mind.
[10156.00s -> 10156.40s]  Never mind.
[10156.40s -> 10156.80s]  Never mind.
[10156.80s -> 10157.20s]  Never mind.
[10163.20s -> 10163.68s]  I love this though.
[10163.68s -> 10164.64s]  This is fantastic.
[10164.64s -> 10167.18s]  I'm going to cut it off.
[10167.18s -> 10169.00s]  A collection of sub badges.
[10169.00s -> 10170.20s]  Oh, shit.
[10174.78s -> 10177.74s]  I have so many empty slots on my Twitch dashboard.
[10179.42s -> 10181.66s]  I really need to do something about this shit.
[10184.83s -> 10185.71s]  Look at that.
[10185.71s -> 10187.48s]  All right, let's go.
[10189.76s -> 10190.24s]  Back to it.
[10193.55s -> 10195.15s]  All right, let's find a bed in the tavern.
[10198.40s -> 10200.96s]  Game Awards start at 3.30 Pacific tomorrow, right?
[10200.96s -> 10204.84s]  I can't wait.
[10205.80s -> 10206.28s]  I'm going to get there.
[10206.28s -> 10207.56s]  I'm going to get my coffee.
[10207.56s -> 10208.76s]  I'm going to have a nice hot coffee.
[10210.27s -> 10211.31s]  Back to the art.
[10211.31s -> 10217.69s]  Okay.
[10217.69s -> 10218.72s]  Here we go.
[10218.72s -> 10221.64s]  What is he holding?
[10221.64s -> 10222.04s]  A disc?
[10227.66s -> 10229.24s]  Can I just smile at him?
[10230.80s -> 10233.44s]  What the fuck am I doing wrong?
[10234.32s -> 10243.88s]  I don't have any armor, but I can afford armor.
[10243.88s -> 10247.48s]  I took a lady out for an expensive quail.
[10248.20s -> 10249.24s]  I don't have any money.
[10262.97s -> 10263.29s]  Boots.
[10263.29s -> 10264.01s]  I have shoes.
[10264.01s -> 10264.57s]  Okay, cool.
[10264.57s -> 10266.01s]  So I have shoes on now.
[10266.01s -> 10273.85s]  I got the boots.
[10273.85s -> 10274.89s]  What about greaves?
[10275.53s -> 10278.25s]  Oh, I can do greaves.
[10278.25s -> 10281.56s]  Just reset.
[10281.56s -> 10282.60s]  No, I can't.
[10290.01s -> 10292.17s]  Please, can you do...
[10292.17s -> 10293.13s]  I don't even know what you're asking.
[10293.13s -> 10294.01s]  I'm not even going to respond.
[10300.52s -> 10309.26s]  Come on.
[10309.26s -> 10313.12s]  11K Andy, 11K Andy, 11K Andy.
[10313.12s -> 10314.28s]  That's pretty good.
[10314.28s -> 10315.00s]  That's really good.
[10315.00s -> 10315.72s]  I'm happy with that.
[10315.72s -> 10316.44s]  That's pretty big.
[10323.77s -> 10326.33s]  How about you went from 12K to 11K?
[10328.60s -> 10328.84s]  So?
[10329.56s -> 10332.80s]  But you guys don't understand when I go on break,
[10333.60s -> 10335.28s]  I fucking squeeze both my fists together.
[10335.28s -> 10339.20s]  I go, I went from fucking 12.3K to 11.1K.
[10340.32s -> 10342.08s]  This can't be happening.
[10342.08s -> 10343.12s]  This can't be happening.
[10343.12s -> 10344.40s]  I've got to pull them back.
[10344.40s -> 10345.36s]  I've got to pull them back,
[10345.36s -> 10346.48s]  and I'm going to do it as best I can.
[10346.48s -> 10348.16s]  I'm going to go in there still making cartoon noises.
[10348.72s -> 10350.60s]  And what should I do?
[10350.60s -> 10351.56s]  Vitality?
[10351.56s -> 10356.22s]  Was it Trump?
[10357.26s -> 10357.58s]  What?
[10359.36s -> 10359.76s]  I'm going to...
[10360.48s -> 10361.44s]  It kind of was.
[10361.44s -> 10362.16s]  Shit.
[10362.16s -> 10366.09s]  I'm going to be pulling them back.
[10366.09s -> 10366.81s]  I'm so...
[10366.81s -> 10368.49s]  No, this is just like I'm annoyed.
[10369.13s -> 10370.25s]  Oh, it is kind of Trump.
[10370.81s -> 10372.30s]  This is I'm...
[10373.50s -> 10374.70s]  I do that all...
[10374.70s -> 10375.50s]  Okay, all right, all right.
[10375.50s -> 10376.22s]  Everybody settle down.
[10376.22s -> 10377.82s]  I'm putting one of the strength, one to attack it.
[10377.82s -> 10378.38s]  What did you say?
[10379.26s -> 10380.62s]  One into vitality.
[10386.49s -> 10387.95s]  What's your favorite cartoon noise?
[10391.61s -> 10392.09s]  That or...
[10393.77s -> 10415.82s]  All right, I got to relax.
[10415.82s -> 10417.74s]  I'm just having too much fun today.
[10417.74s -> 10419.34s]  I'm having way too much fun today.
[10419.98s -> 10430.81s]  This guy has so much shit on.
[10441.10s -> 10441.90s]  Come on.
[10441.90s -> 10444.62s]  70% chance.
[10444.62s -> 10445.82s]  How do you not...
[10445.82s -> 10448.94s]  How do you miss 70% chance three times in a row?
[10449.50s -> 10450.52s]  I don't understand.
[10451.24s -> 10458.57s]  It's because duels are only first blood.
[10459.90s -> 10460.78s]  Yeah, but I...
[10466.19s -> 10468.67s]  Okay, all right.
[10468.67s -> 10469.39s]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[10469.39s -> 10470.11s]  I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[10471.07s -> 10472.03s]  Some armor on.
[10472.03s -> 10472.75s]  It costs money.
[10473.47s -> 10478.72s]  That costs money.
[10478.72s -> 10479.84s]  Play Binding of Isaac.
[10479.84s -> 10481.36s]  Ooh, when's the expansion coming out?
[10493.63s -> 10496.52s]  Okay, do I finally have enough money to buy anything?
[10499.34s -> 10499.90s]  First blood.
[10499.90s -> 10500.86s]  I got to go for a stab.
[10500.86s -> 10502.46s]  A quick 92% stab in the face.
[10503.02s -> 10507.05s]  Sometime before the end of the year is what's planned.
[10507.05s -> 10507.53s]  Wait, what?
[10508.09s -> 10512.70s]  Can't do that.
[10512.70s -> 10514.06s]  I have to reset again.
[10514.06s -> 10517.16s]  Do I really have to reset again?
[10517.16s -> 10518.04s]  I can't be, right?
[10518.60s -> 10524.44s]  Just get a weapon.
[10524.44s -> 10528.59s]  I can't do it.
[10529.15s -> 10529.63s]  I really don't...
[10529.63s -> 10530.51s]  I don't think I can do it.
[10556.91s -> 10558.75s]  Die, you motherfucker!
[10558.75s -> 10562.06s]  You need way more armor.
[10562.06s -> 10564.86s]  Yeah, I need to not die five times in a row.
[10568.59s -> 10568.99s]  I have to...
[10568.99s -> 10569.71s]  I'd have to get lucky.
[10570.43s -> 10576.09s]  This guy's got a club.
[10582.57s -> 10583.45s]  Yes, okay.
[10583.45s -> 10583.85s]  We're good.
[10585.34s -> 10585.90s]  Okay, hold on.
[10585.90s -> 10586.78s]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[10588.96s -> 10589.92s]  No, you dick!
[10595.79s -> 10596.27s]  Where did he...
[10597.56s -> 10597.96s]  92.
[10598.68s -> 10599.08s]  Come on.
[10599.64s -> 10599.96s]  Again.
[10600.76s -> 10601.08s]  Again.
[10602.73s -> 10603.77s]  No, don't let him win.
[10606.33s -> 10607.13s]  Yes.
[10607.13s -> 10619.45s]  All right, come on, John the Butcher.
[10619.45s -> 10620.01s]  This is the one.
[10621.44s -> 10621.92s]  Come on.
[10622.48s -> 10623.74s]  This is the one right here.
[10627.76s -> 10628.24s]  Blocked it.
[10628.24s -> 10628.80s]  Okay, get in.
[10631.53s -> 10633.82s]  Okay.
[10640.06s -> 10641.42s]  That hurt a lot.
[10644.68s -> 10645.00s]  Yes!
[10647.95s -> 10649.23s]  Oh, it hurt.
[10649.23s -> 10650.43s]  It hurt, it hurt, it hurt, it hurt.
[10651.15s -> 10651.87s]  I'm gonna lose.
[10660.12s -> 10661.08s]  God damn it!
[10661.08s -> 10661.72s]  I'm in trouble.
[10679.85s -> 10680.73s]  I'm trying to sleep.
[10681.69s -> 10682.65s]  Just stay away from me.
[10683.82s -> 10684.62s]  Get away from me.
[10685.26s -> 10685.98s]  Stay away from me.
[10687.84s -> 10689.12s]  I'm running out of room.
[10689.12s -> 10695.34s]  Oh my, how big is this place?
[10695.34s -> 10696.30s]  I want rest and heal.
[10697.26s -> 10697.98s]  Rest and heal.
[10699.02s -> 10701.82s]  Rest and heal.
[10710.84s -> 10720.14s]  How come I can't heal?
[10720.14s -> 10725.77s]  Rest and heal.
[10725.77s -> 10727.05s]  Keep walking, keep walking.
[10735.61s -> 10737.53s]  Rest and heal.
[10737.53s -> 10737.85s]  There we go.
[10737.85s -> 10738.89s]  All right, all right, right, right.
[10747.13s -> 10749.29s]  What just happened?
[10749.29s -> 10750.73s]  Oh, shit.
[10750.73s -> 10751.13s]  Come on.
[10751.13s -> 10752.17s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[10754.59s -> 10756.91s]  This is the most boring fight ever.
[10756.91s -> 10758.51s]  Imagine paying for front row seats here.
[10764.28s -> 10766.84s]  God damn it, I'm dead.
[10766.84s -> 10768.84s]  I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
[10768.84s -> 10770.28s]  I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
[10770.28s -> 10771.40s]  Run, run, run, run away.
[10771.40s -> 10771.96s]  Run, run, run.
[10773.85s -> 10775.34s]  Oh, shit, can I go behind him?
[10775.34s -> 10783.85s]  Oh, come on, get him.
[10783.85s -> 10784.25s]  Come on.
[10785.50s -> 10786.22s]  Come on, heal.
[10789.08s -> 10789.32s]  No.
[10793.72s -> 10794.76s]  Come on, dude.
[10794.76s -> 10795.72s]  God damn it.
[10796.84s -> 10799.72s]  No, I have to get this right.
[10799.72s -> 10803.24s]  I can't just pay like some lady $1,500 for food.
[10804.12s -> 10806.43s]  I can't just pay somebody $1,500 for food.
[10806.43s -> 10808.35s]  Just win, win.
[10808.35s -> 10809.87s]  For God's sakes, just win.
[10810.35s -> 10821.72s]  Ah, five strength, four strength, four attack, three defense, four defense.
[10821.72s -> 10826.67s]  Okay, four stamina, two, three stamina.
[10826.67s -> 10827.55s]  Okay, all right.
[10828.11s -> 10829.07s]  I don't care what his name is.
[10829.07s -> 10829.95s]  Who cares?
[10829.95s -> 10834.78s]  It's the same person.
[10842.51s -> 10851.76s]  If I do not beat this guy, I'm going to be very mad.
[10852.40s -> 10861.60s]  Here we go.
[10861.60s -> 10865.47s]  Are you ready?
[10865.47s -> 10867.55s]  I'm going to stab this guy once and win.
[10867.55s -> 10868.51s]  And then go buy the axe.
[10874.96s -> 10876.89s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[10877.93s -> 10880.09s]  What the fuck is going on?
[10930.12s -> 10930.68s]  Okay.
[10930.68s -> 10931.72s]  All right, all right, all right.
[10931.72s -> 10932.44s]  I'm good.
[10932.44s -> 10936.56s]  What should I put it in?
[10937.20s -> 10945.39s]  Attack and strength, defense and vitality.
[10945.39s -> 10955.60s]  How much money do I have?
[10956.16s -> 10959.95s]  I need, okay, I need to win a few more.
[10959.95s -> 10961.31s]  I'm going to get the crowd riled up.
[10970.99s -> 10974.41s]  How are they still bored?
[10974.41s -> 10983.32s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[11000.65s -> 11001.85s]  Back up, back up.
[11001.85s -> 11008.48s]  Get me in there, get me in there.
[11008.48s -> 11009.12s]  Okay.
[11009.12s -> 11011.36s]  Oh, fuck you.
[11011.36s -> 11012.16s]  Thank God.
[11012.16s -> 11022.52s]  Vitality and strength.
[11031.71s -> 11032.35s]  Weaponsmith.
[11032.35s -> 11032.91s]  Come on.
[11032.91s -> 11033.87s]  Let's go.
[11033.87s -> 11034.59s]  2,200.
[11036.32s -> 11039.31s]  I have enough of the axe.
[11039.31s -> 11040.19s]  Let's get the axe.
[11042.33s -> 11043.21s]  Thank God.
[11043.21s -> 11045.37s]  I have a goddamn weapon now.
[11045.37s -> 11048.54s]  And it's time for the tournament.
[11048.54s -> 11049.10s]  It's time.
[11049.66s -> 11051.18s]  I'm going to win.
[11051.18s -> 11051.66s]  Let's go.
[11051.66s -> 11053.58s]  If I lose right now, then I'm going to be doing something else
[11053.58s -> 11055.82s]  because obviously I'm not, I cut out for this apparently.
[11055.82s -> 11057.58s]  I'm not cut out for this game if I can't do it.
[11068.92s -> 11069.64s]  It was risky.
[11084.22s -> 11084.78s]  Okay.
[11084.78s -> 11088.27s]  Otis?
[11088.83s -> 11090.16s]  Bootis?
[11090.16s -> 11095.26s]  Okay, here we go.
[11099.55s -> 11100.03s]  Nice fall.
[11100.03s -> 11100.67s]  That's comedy.
[11101.39s -> 11102.11s]  That's pretty funny.
[11104.70s -> 11105.82s]  Good guy in the audience.
[11112.75s -> 11113.98s]  Come on.
[11113.98s -> 11116.09s]  92%.
[11116.09s -> 11118.80s]  We're going with normal.
[11118.80s -> 11119.04s]  Again.
[11127.15s -> 11128.22s]  Aye.
[11128.86s -> 11129.18s]  All right.
[11129.18s -> 11130.94s]  Here comes, here comes the butcher.
[11130.94s -> 11135.47s]  This is it.
[11135.47s -> 11136.43s]  I have to win this.
[11136.99s -> 11140.35s]  Doesn't, his armor sucks.
[11140.35s -> 11142.03s]  Why is, how is it, how does he have that much armor?
[11153.08s -> 11153.56s]  Let's go.
[11154.44s -> 11155.24s]  Let's go.
[11155.24s -> 11157.16s]  Wow, he put himself in such a bad spot.
[11157.16s -> 11158.67s]  And he slept too.
[11158.67s -> 11160.03s]  Perfect opportunity to get to him.
[11160.59s -> 11160.99s]  Nice.
[11160.99s -> 11161.39s]  All right.
[11161.39s -> 11161.79s]  Let's go.
[11161.79s -> 11163.44s]  Forward, move forward.
[11163.44s -> 11164.16s]  Lunch.
[11164.16s -> 11166.08s]  What are we at?
[11166.08s -> 11167.20s]  70, only go for the 70%.
[11169.48s -> 11171.47s]  Move forward, we're not going to do anything stupid.
[11171.47s -> 11173.07s]  Again, move forward, not going to do anything dumb.
[11173.07s -> 11174.99s]  Move forward again, not going to do anything stupid.
[11174.99s -> 11177.36s]  He just crit me for fucking 50 damage.
[11177.36s -> 11178.56s]  You piece of shit.
[11178.56s -> 11179.36s]  Are you kidding me?
[11181.13s -> 11181.45s]  Really?
[11181.45s -> 11230.04s]  Fuck, I just cut off my attack.
[11230.04s -> 11233.32s]  The guy, if I get close, I'm going to die.
[11233.32s -> 11252.96s]  I don't even know what the character looks like.
[11252.96s -> 11256.68s]  I don't even know what he had points in.
[11267.64s -> 11270.46s]  Just go full charisma.
[11271.34s -> 11278.00s]  I'm never going to beat the butcher.
[11278.00s -> 11288.16s]  Fine.
[11288.16s -> 11288.80s]  Fuck it.
[11300.43s -> 11302.35s]  How about just a bashing stick?
[11302.91s -> 11306.54s]  Christmas OP, just yell and taunt.
[11306.54s -> 11311.93s]  No, get armor first.
[11311.93s -> 11312.17s]  Okay.
[11312.81s -> 11316.14s]  So should I just get a big chest plate?
[11316.88s -> 11318.88s]  What's the best thing to buy first?
[11319.52s -> 11320.16s]  Please help me.
[11320.16s -> 11321.36s]  I can't beat the butcher.
[11321.92s -> 11329.93s]  Just get all the cheapest shit.
[11329.93s -> 11332.48s]  So just get all the cheap crap?
[11332.48s -> 11347.71s]  Like the 48, these peasant boots?
[11347.71s -> 11348.91s]  Single comma name.
[11348.91s -> 11349.15s]  What?
[11350.48s -> 11350.72s]  No.
[11351.98s -> 11352.22s]  All right.
[11352.22s -> 11352.70s]  I'm just going to...
[11352.70s -> 11352.94s]  Okay.
[11353.58s -> 11354.56s]  I'm going to buy these.
[11355.36s -> 11357.64s]  I'm going to buy how much of these?
[11358.28s -> 11359.26s]  400, hold on.
[11359.98s -> 11362.68s]  Gauntlets are 300.
[11365.31s -> 11366.35s]  Helmet is cheap.
[11366.35s -> 11366.99s]  No, it's not.
[11367.88s -> 11369.00s]  Shoulder guards are cheap.
[11369.00s -> 11369.56s]  No, they're not.
[11370.28s -> 11371.64s]  Gauntlets are cheap.
[11371.64s -> 11372.12s]  Yes, they are.
[11372.84s -> 11373.96s]  We'll get the middle of the road ones.
[11374.52s -> 11377.04s]  What about a shield?
[11377.04s -> 11378.00s]  Can I get a cheap shield?
[11378.00s -> 11378.24s]  No.
[11379.34s -> 11379.82s]  Greaves.
[11379.82s -> 11380.06s]  Okay.
[11380.86s -> 11381.26s]  These are...
[11381.26s -> 11381.90s]  Okay.
[11381.90s -> 11382.62s]  Get the greaves.
[11383.42s -> 11386.80s]  Shoulder guards.
[11386.80s -> 11388.08s]  I'm just going to get the...
[11388.72s -> 11389.92s]  I'll get the cheap shoulder guards.
[11390.48s -> 11394.22s]  Or should I get shin guards instead?
[11394.94s -> 11396.22s]  Do the shoulder guards.
[11396.22s -> 11397.98s]  Okay.
[11398.94s -> 11400.38s]  I bought all the armor I could buy.
[11401.18s -> 11405.26s]  So now I'm going to go and I'm going to start screaming at people for the duels.
[11405.26s -> 11406.86s]  And I'm going to taunt and I'm going to make a bunch of money.
[11428.25s -> 11429.45s]  Get me over there now.
[11450.94s -> 11452.75s]  How can you block a scream?
[11463.61s -> 11464.41s]  God damn it.
[11478.00s -> 11480.00s]  Get that first hit on him.
[11480.00s -> 11508.19s]  Let's work the crowd and make some money.
[11516.67s -> 11517.39s]  What is this guy's weapon?
[11517.39s -> 11518.75s]  He's got a golden sword.
[11518.75s -> 11531.66s]  Why is this working?
[11542.97s -> 11543.69s]  Stop.
[11543.69s -> 11544.25s]  Come on.
[11548.89s -> 11552.75s]  You piece of shit.
[11552.75s -> 11552.99s]  All right.
[11552.99s -> 11553.47s]  I'm good.
[11553.47s -> 11556.27s]  Okay.
[11556.27s -> 11557.15s]  Doing all right.
[11557.15s -> 11559.47s]  I don't want to mess this up now.
[11559.47s -> 11560.19s]  Seriously.
[11560.19s -> 11562.25s]  What should I really put this into?
[11562.89s -> 11572.06s]  Charisma and vitality.
[11573.88s -> 11574.36s]  Charisma.
[11574.36s -> 11574.92s]  Seriously.
[11574.92s -> 11575.32s]  Seriously.
[11575.32s -> 11575.72s]  Charisma.
[11575.72s -> 11576.20s]  Stamina.
[11576.76s -> 11578.46s]  I'm going to do...
[11578.46s -> 11579.18s]  All right.
[11579.18s -> 11583.55s]  What do I got for money?
[11586.88s -> 11587.92s]  2400.
[11587.92s -> 11588.32s]  Okay.
[11588.32s -> 11588.88s]  I'm going to save it.
[11588.88s -> 11590.00s]  I'm going to keep screaming at people.
[11592.57s -> 11592.81s]  No.
[11592.81s -> 11592.97s]  Okay.
[11592.97s -> 11594.41s]  I had to buy something.
[11594.41s -> 11595.92s]  What do I do?
[11595.92s -> 11601.07s]  I feel like I should just get this.
[11606.67s -> 11607.39s]  Enchant the club.
[11608.03s -> 11610.48s]  Or better armor.
[11610.48s -> 11611.96s]  The waist?
[11614.89s -> 11615.29s]  Armor.
[11615.29s -> 11615.69s]  Armor.
[11615.69s -> 11616.01s]  Armor.
[11616.01s -> 11616.33s]  Armor.
[11616.33s -> 11616.65s]  Armor.
[11616.65s -> 11616.97s]  Armor.
[11616.97s -> 11617.21s]  Okay.
[11618.73s -> 11619.53s]  A shield?
[11619.53s -> 11622.12s]  I could get a shield.
[11622.12s -> 11626.28s]  Okay.
[11626.28s -> 11630.41s]  What else can I get?
[11630.41s -> 11632.08s]  Shin guards?
[11632.08s -> 11633.12s]  All right.
[11633.12s -> 11633.44s]  Okay.
[11633.44s -> 11634.32s]  I can get shin guards.
[11636.65s -> 11636.89s]  Okay.
[11638.52s -> 11639.16s]  All right.
[11639.16s -> 11642.19s]  I think I'm ready.
[11642.19s -> 11644.67s]  I already have these, right?
[11648.68s -> 11649.08s]  Potions?
[11649.08s -> 11649.96s]  I can't buy potions.
[11649.96s -> 11650.84s]  I don't have enough magic.
[11651.48s -> 11659.32s]  Okay.
[11659.32s -> 11661.00s]  You need four magicka to buy potion.
[11661.80s -> 11662.75s]  Go enchant.
[11663.39s -> 11665.10s]  Okay.
[11665.10s -> 11665.50s]  Enchant.
[11667.10s -> 11668.54s]  So I'm going to enchant with...
[11669.34s -> 11672.44s]  I'm going to enchant my rusty knife.
[11673.60s -> 11674.80s]  With fire.
[11674.80s -> 11680.97s]  Or ice?
[11680.97s -> 11684.12s]  Yeah.
[11684.12s -> 11684.76s]  We're going to fire.
[11685.40s -> 11688.86s]  That's one flame, one frost, one poison.
[11688.86s -> 11689.02s]  Yeah.
[11689.02s -> 11689.74s]  We're just going to fire.
[11689.74s -> 11690.06s]  Whatever.
[11691.90s -> 11692.94s]  Potency.
[11692.94s -> 11695.58s]  Add three fire damage.
[11695.58s -> 11695.82s]  That's...
[11696.78s -> 11697.26s]  For free?
[11697.82s -> 11698.22s]  All right.
[11698.22s -> 11698.94s]  That's pretty sick.
[11699.74s -> 11700.81s]  All right.
[11700.81s -> 11701.13s]  Let's go.
[11701.85s -> 11703.31s]  I'm ready.
[11703.31s -> 11705.77s]  I'm going to beat John the Butcher right now.
[11706.49s -> 11708.84s]  I'm so sick of this.
[11708.84s -> 11709.00s]  Okay.
[11709.00s -> 11710.04s]  I've got 107 armor.
[11710.04s -> 11710.36s]  Let's go.
[11711.40s -> 11723.42s]  Burnt him with my sound?
[11725.98s -> 11739.69s]  Am I finally going to beat the butcher?
[11740.92s -> 11741.40s]  Please.
[11741.40s -> 11742.76s]  Am I finally going to beat the butcher?
[11743.72s -> 11747.07s]  With my yell build?
[11751.98s -> 11758.88s]  I told you to do this build.
[11759.84s -> 11760.00s]  Yeah.
[11760.00s -> 11760.40s]  But I don't know.
[11760.40s -> 11762.24s]  I was under the impression that this was just a joke
[11762.24s -> 11763.76s]  that we were doing in the beginning of the game.
[11763.76s -> 11765.12s]  I didn't know it was actually viable.
[11765.92s -> 11774.48s]  I want the money.
[11774.48s -> 11777.74s]  He's got a long way to go before he gets over here.
[11786.35s -> 11786.67s]  No.
[11786.67s -> 11787.23s]  He's coming.
[11787.23s -> 11791.61s]  Hold on.
[11791.61s -> 11792.81s]  Oh, that hurt.
[11792.81s -> 11796.04s]  Good.
[11796.04s -> 11796.52s]  Good, good.
[11796.52s -> 11796.84s]  All right.
[11796.84s -> 11797.32s]  No.
[11797.32s -> 11797.64s]  Back up.
[11797.64s -> 11798.04s]  Back up.
[11798.04s -> 11798.52s]  Back him up.
[11801.55s -> 11804.32s]  Come on.
[11809.04s -> 11809.52s]  There it is.
[11813.55s -> 11816.25s]  Again.
[11816.25s -> 11816.57s]  Again.
[11818.06s -> 11818.30s]  Again.
[11819.58s -> 11819.90s]  Again.
[11821.18s -> 11821.90s]  Again.
[11821.90s -> 11822.38s]  Again.
[11822.38s -> 11822.78s]  Again.
[11822.78s -> 11823.18s]  Again.
[11823.18s -> 11823.58s]  Again.
[11823.58s -> 11823.90s]  Again.
[11823.90s -> 11824.30s]  Again.
[11824.30s -> 11824.62s]  Again.
[11824.62s -> 11824.86s]  All right.
[11832.16s -> 11833.12s]  15 charisma.
[11834.33s -> 11835.13s]  For John the butcher,
[11835.13s -> 11837.05s]  I think I'm going to have to do some more defense.
[11837.05s -> 11840.41s]  What vitality?
[11840.41s -> 11843.34s]  Which one?
[11843.34s -> 11844.14s]  Vitality probably?
[11844.14s -> 11844.30s]  Yeah.
[11845.84s -> 11846.08s]  All right.
[11846.08s -> 11846.56s]  Bring him on.
[11846.56s -> 11846.96s]  Let's go.
[11846.96s -> 11848.08s]  I'm done with this bullshit.
[11848.96s -> 11853.60s]  There it is.
[11853.60s -> 11853.92s]  All right.
[11853.92s -> 11854.40s]  38.
[11857.28s -> 11857.92s]  38 again.
[11857.92s -> 11858.88s]  This is the win.
[11858.88s -> 11859.76s]  This is the win right now.
[11868.70s -> 11869.42s]  Get away from me.
[11870.94s -> 11889.82s]  Eventually, it's going to work.
[11889.82s -> 11890.78s]  It's a matter of time.
[11891.50s -> 11893.52s]  Oh, you know what?
[11893.52s -> 11895.04s]  Let's get a little step.
[11895.04s -> 11896.24s]  No, let's not get a little.
[11899.07s -> 11899.63s]  Move him away.
[11901.69s -> 11902.33s]  Nice.
[11902.33s -> 11902.89s]  Come on.
[11902.89s -> 11903.21s]  Please.
[11903.21s -> 11904.65s]  Let me beat John the butcher.
[11908.06s -> 11908.38s]  Yes.
[11909.85s -> 11910.25s]  Yes.
[11911.05s -> 11911.77s]  Finally.
[11911.77s -> 11912.89s]  He's dead.
[11912.89s -> 11914.09s]  It took like an hour.
[11915.05s -> 11919.13s]  12,500 gold pieces.
[11920.19s -> 11920.91s]  What?
[11920.91s -> 11921.15s]  What?
[11921.87s -> 11931.68s]  Oh, my God.
[11931.68s -> 11932.08s]  Okay.
[11932.08s -> 11934.00s]  Well, now I need to figure out what the hell I'm going to do.
[11938.72s -> 11939.28s]  Breastplate.
[11940.88s -> 11941.92s]  I have to get this one, right?
[11944.94s -> 11945.74s]  64 armor.
[11945.74s -> 11947.74s]  So I just dump all my money into this breastplate.
[11948.30s -> 11954.81s]  3% damage taken converted to energy.
[11955.45s -> 11969.82s]  What about a shield?
[11969.82s -> 11970.46s]  Definitely this one.
[11970.46s -> 11971.02s]  Look at this thing.
[11971.66s -> 11977.42s]  Okay.
[11977.42s -> 11977.66s]  Nice.
[11978.64s -> 11978.96s]  Nice.
[11978.96s -> 11979.20s]  Nice.
[11979.20s -> 11979.44s]  Nice.
[11979.44s -> 11979.60s]  All right.
[11979.60s -> 11980.16s]  What about this one?
[11984.19s -> 11984.91s]  Now enchant.
[11985.55s -> 11990.33s]  Enchant weapon.
[11990.33s -> 11993.16s]  Enchant.
[11993.16s -> 11993.88s]  More potency.
[11994.52s -> 11996.30s]  Do fire again?
[11998.72s -> 11999.44s]  Buy a weapon.
[12000.16s -> 12001.74s]  Oh, I don't have enough money for a weapon.
[12010.25s -> 12011.05s]  Save at the church.
[12011.05s -> 12012.81s]  I need to make an account to save and I'm not doing it.
[12013.69s -> 12014.49s]  All right.
[12014.49s -> 12015.05s]  Let's try this.
[12016.56s -> 12017.28s]  Level five.
[12017.28s -> 12018.08s]  Level five.
[12018.08s -> 12018.64s]  All right.
[12018.64s -> 12020.00s]  Look at all this armor, though.
[12020.00s -> 12020.96s]  This guy doesn't have any armor.
[12022.00s -> 12023.28s]  I just instantly killed that guy.
[12023.84s -> 12026.01s]  I just made money.
[12026.65s -> 12032.24s]  This guy doesn't have any armor either.
[12032.24s -> 12032.40s]  All right.
[12032.40s -> 12033.20s]  We're going to work with the crowd.
[12033.20s -> 12034.56s]  I want to work with the crowd a little bit.
[12035.36s -> 12035.76s]  I'm just...
[12035.76s -> 12036.00s]  Wait.
[12036.00s -> 12037.04s]  Did I just burn him with...
[12037.04s -> 12038.64s]  I just farted on him and I burnt him?
[12039.20s -> 12040.00s]  What the hell was that?
[12053.28s -> 12054.80s]  It was a charisma fart.
[12057.61s -> 12058.65s]  Don't let him get the first hit.
[12058.65s -> 12058.81s]  All right.
[12058.81s -> 12059.53s]  Crowd's entertained.
[12059.53s -> 12059.93s]  Hold on.
[12065.88s -> 12066.44s]  Interested.
[12068.44s -> 12069.16s]  Entertained.
[12070.84s -> 12072.04s]  Enthusiastic.
[12072.04s -> 12072.28s]  Okay.
[12072.28s -> 12072.68s]  I don't care.
[12072.68s -> 12073.32s]  I'm still dancing.
[12073.32s -> 12074.04s]  Let's fill that bar.
[12074.60s -> 12075.56s]  Wildly entertained.
[12075.56s -> 12075.80s]  More.
[12078.60s -> 12079.56s]  Wildly entertained.
[12082.68s -> 12083.40s]  Transfixed.
[12086.22s -> 12086.86s]  Fanatical.
[12090.51s -> 12090.75s]  And...
[12091.31s -> 12097.05s]  Come on.
[12097.05s -> 12097.45s]  Get him.
[12101.79s -> 12102.67s]  Get him.
[12102.67s -> 12103.79s]  All right.
[12104.59s -> 12105.47s]  Get him out of transfixed.
[12107.00s -> 12107.56s]  Fanatical.
[12108.28s -> 12109.92s]  How much money do you get for doing this?
[12115.96s -> 12116.28s]  Back up.
[12116.28s -> 12116.60s]  Back up.
[12116.60s -> 12117.00s]  Back up.
[12117.00s -> 12117.24s]  Back up.
[12117.24s -> 12117.56s]  Back up.
[12117.56s -> 12117.72s]  All right.
[12117.72s -> 12118.04s]  Here we go.
[12120.22s -> 12121.18s]  Just kill him.
[12121.18s -> 12122.06s]  Just punch him in the face.
[12126.33s -> 12128.01s]  3,200...
[12128.01s -> 12129.77s]  3,300 gold for that.
[12131.90s -> 12133.74s]  Holy shit.
[12133.74s -> 12142.86s]  What do I do?
[12144.22s -> 12145.26s]  Not all charisma.
[12145.26s -> 12146.06s]  I can't be a dope.
[12149.18s -> 12149.90s]  I mean, maybe one.
[12149.90s -> 12150.30s]  One more.
[12151.85s -> 12152.57s]  New weapon.
[12152.57s -> 12153.05s]  What do we need?
[12153.05s -> 12153.61s]  What do we want?
[12155.74s -> 12156.14s]  Bow?
[12156.14s -> 12156.38s]  No.
[12157.02s -> 12159.32s]  What about this?
[12159.32s -> 12160.44s]  I got 6,000 gold.
[12161.16s -> 12171.95s]  I kind of need to do that.
[12171.95s -> 12172.75s]  I have to buy this.
[12173.47s -> 12175.37s]  Don't buy a weapon, you dummy.
[12179.00s -> 12179.64s]  More armor.
[12181.68s -> 12182.00s]  Okay.
[12184.89s -> 12187.71s]  Let's replace the chin guards.
[12188.80s -> 12189.12s]  Ooh.
[12190.08s -> 12190.72s]  Look at these ones.
[12191.74s -> 12191.98s]  Yeah.
[12193.29s -> 12193.61s]  Nice.
[12193.61s -> 12193.93s]  Okay.
[12194.57s -> 12195.21s]  New greaves.
[12195.77s -> 12197.37s]  Oh, look at these.
[12197.37s -> 12198.17s]  Veteran greaves.
[12198.89s -> 12199.29s]  Nice.
[12199.29s -> 12199.69s]  Okay.
[12199.69s -> 12200.89s]  What about new boots?
[12203.07s -> 12204.19s]  Oh, veteran boots.
[12210.01s -> 12210.49s]  Greaves.
[12211.05s -> 12212.68s]  Okay.
[12212.68s -> 12213.00s]  All right.
[12213.00s -> 12214.20s]  I'm gonna say about...
[12214.20s -> 12220.11s]  Level 9.
[12226.43s -> 12228.11s]  229 armor.
[12234.57s -> 12234.97s]  Easy.
[12236.78s -> 12237.66s]  Easy with this.
[12247.79s -> 12248.27s]  Block that.
[12248.99s -> 12251.92s]  3,700 gold, dude.
[12252.80s -> 12254.04s]  Looking pretty good.
[12254.76s -> 12260.00s]  Just level 3.
[12260.64s -> 12264.00s]  Why is a level 3 fighting a level 6?
[12264.64s -> 12273.80s]  Save up for the better helmet?
[12276.64s -> 12278.08s]  You're never gonna break my armor, dude.
[12278.08s -> 12281.20s]  I'm gonna sit here all day until I get the most amount of money possible.
[12287.74s -> 12288.46s]  Nice weapon.
[12294.40s -> 12307.79s]  I had 200...
[12307.79s -> 12309.47s]  I had 200 armor.
[12310.03s -> 12312.30s]  How did that happen?
[12312.30s -> 12317.87s]  A crit goes through armor?
[12319.31s -> 12320.35s]  Oh, you shitting me.
[12321.07s -> 12331.84s]  Don't...
[12331.84s -> 12332.24s]  Okay.

[12333.68s -> 12339.58s]  Can even shoot...
[12339.58s -> 12340.06s]  Okay.
[12340.06s -> 12340.54s]  He's dead.
[12341.34s -> 12344.91s]  I just beat John the Butcher, chat.

[12353.37s -> 12354.65s]  Swift sandals, was that?
[12355.45s -> 12367.82s]  Don't crit me.
[12373.31s -> 12388.19s]  That counts, right?
[12388.19s -> 12388.99s]  Chauvin taunt.
[12388.99s -> 12390.11s]  Don't ever use your weapon.
[12391.07s -> 12399.96s]  So just never upgrade the weapon?
[12399.96s -> 12400.36s]  Never.
[12400.36s -> 12405.31s]  What the hell?
[12405.31s -> 12406.51s]  I don't want to just do only...

[12417.29s -> 12418.09s]  I'm gonna save the money.
[12418.73s -> 12419.28s]  All right.
[12419.28s -> 12419.60s]  No, no, no.
[12419.60s -> 12419.84s]  I'm not.
[12419.84s -> 12420.48s]  No, I'm not.
[12420.48s -> 12420.72s]  Okay.

[12443.76s -> 12444.24s]  Okay.
[12446.24s -> 12447.12s]  Helmet, you fool.
[12447.12s -> 12448.08s]  All right, I got it.
[12448.08s -> 12448.64s]  All right, let's go.
[12448.64s -> 12450.24s]  Let's kick this guy's ass.
[12450.24s -> 12453.24s]  What's the next tournament?
[12453.24s -> 12454.76s]  The evil ninja.
[12454.76s -> 12461.87s]  What the hell is this?

[12470.60s -> 12471.64s]  Psych up three.
[12475.04s -> 12476.46s]  What the hell am I doing?
[12478.33s -> 12491.82s]  To charge up power mood.
[12491.82s -> 12493.74s]  Yeah, but I just yell at people, right?
[12493.74s -> 12507.05s]  Yeah, what's the point of doing that?
[12513.02s -> 12514.22s]  Screaming and farting.
[12515.74s -> 12516.46s]  It really is.
[12523.96s -> 12525.16s]  I think I can fill that bar.
[12525.16s -> 12526.04s]  He's not going to kill me.
[12529.20s -> 12530.64s]  Fart and scream build.
[12530.64s -> 12531.20s]  I know.
[12531.20s -> 12533.28s]  Well, look, I didn't intend for that to happen tonight.
[12539.34s -> 12540.14s]  He's in close.
[12540.14s -> 12540.54s]  Just kill him.
[12543.68s -> 12554.20s]  Don't use your weapon.
[12554.20s -> 12556.28s]  Well, sometimes we have like a 70% chance.
[12556.28s -> 12557.08s]  That's good.

[12577.55s -> 12578.91s]  Haunt is 99.
[12579.95s -> 12581.79s]  My god, it's so stupid.
[12583.07s -> 12584.51s]  It's so stupid.
[12588.30s -> 12589.66s]  That sword looks kind of scary.
[12592.38s -> 12593.18s]  No farting.
[12594.06s -> 12594.70s]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[12594.70s -> 12595.66s]  I haven't incorporated it.
[12596.54s -> 12597.66s]  I got to get my rotation.
[12598.46s -> 12600.99s]  Okay, what happened?
[12600.99s -> 12612.86s]  Here comes the evil ninja.

[12631.08s -> 12643.37s]  Oh, come on.
[12643.37s -> 12652.20s]  Oh, come on.
[12663.88s -> 12664.92s]  Does it not work?
[12664.92s -> 12666.12s]  He has shout protection.
[12667.32s -> 12668.20s]  He has shout protection.
[12668.20s -> 12668.68s]  It doesn't work.
[12670.44s -> 12671.16s]  I can't kill him.
[12671.16s -> 12672.04s]  He has shout protection.
[12678.17s -> 12679.21s]  Where did it go?
[12679.21s -> 12680.33s]  Where did it go?
[12682.28s -> 12682.92s]  What just happened?
[12682.92s -> 12683.56s]  He just pulled my.
[12692.73s -> 12696.41s]  Am I seriously going to lose because he has like shout protection?
[12703.47s -> 12703.71s]  No.
[12706.60s -> 12708.70s]  Oh, you got to be kidding me.
[12708.70s -> 12711.98s]  Why did you guys tell me that was 57 fucking damage?
[12718.64s -> 12718.88s]  Yet.
[12730.28s -> 12731.80s]  Why is it not hurting him though?
[12731.80s -> 12732.60s]  It should be hurting him.
[12734.64s -> 12738.97s]  No, it don't work.
[12738.97s -> 12739.45s]  It doesn't work.
[12740.09s -> 12740.57s]  It's over.
[12754.19s -> 12757.00s]  Did I do it?
[12757.00s -> 12757.72s]  Oh, shit.
[12757.72s -> 12758.36s]  That was stupid.
[12758.36s -> 12759.08s]  Didn't do anything.
[12770.40s -> 12771.76s]  One of these has to land, right?
[12773.04s -> 12774.25s]  It says blocked.
[12780.60s -> 12781.08s]  Holy shit.
[12781.08s -> 12781.40s]  It worked.
[12781.40s -> 12782.36s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12782.36s -> 12784.04s]  Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, ladies and gentlemen.
[12784.04s -> 12784.68s]  Hold on a second.
[12784.68s -> 12785.64s]  Everyone relax.
[12786.36s -> 12787.24s]  Everyone relax for a sec.
[12788.12s -> 12789.72s]  I did 57 damage.
[12789.72s -> 12790.36s]  We're OK.
[12795.00s -> 12795.64s]  We're going to be fine.
[12796.36s -> 12796.84s]  We're OK.

[12850.59s -> 12851.55s]  Plus 85.
[12853.16s -> 12854.12s]  He's got healing potions.
[12854.12s -> 12854.68s]  Of course he does.
[12856.25s -> 12856.97s]  Get away from me.
[12857.85s -> 12859.13s]  Get the fuck away from me.

[12878.49s -> 12879.53s]  And we thought I was going to lose.
[12879.53s -> 12880.73s]  We thought I was going to lose that one.
[12880.73s -> 12881.93s]  No, not that one.
[12881.93s -> 12882.89s]  17,000 gold.
[12882.89s -> 12883.93s]  I'll take it.
[12883.93s -> 12899.68s]  What do I got on now?
[12899.68s -> 12900.24s]  This?
[12900.24s -> 12901.28s]  This is double the armor.
[12901.84s -> 12910.59s]  OK.
[12910.67s -> 12913.05s]  Shoulder guards?
[12913.05s -> 12914.65s]  No, I already have the best ones on.

[12930.20s -> 12931.48s]  I have the best greaves on.
[12932.49s -> 12933.05s]  Chin guards.
[12933.05s -> 12934.88s]  Yeah, these are the worst.
[12934.88s -> 12936.24s]  Put these on please.
[12936.24s -> 12939.56s]  Improve that shoulder.
[12939.56s -> 12940.52s]  No, I can't.
[12940.52s -> 12943.88s]  Get a fucking weapon.
[12944.44s -> 12946.24s]  All right, I'm just going to get a weapon
[12946.24s -> 12947.28s]  because why wouldn't I?
[12947.28s -> 12948.48s]  Just give me the turkey leg.
[12948.48s -> 12948.96s]  Who cares?
[12949.68s -> 12960.73s]  I don't have money.
[12961.37s -> 12962.81s]  Oh, well potency two.
[12962.81s -> 12963.13s]  Whatever.
[12965.24s -> 12965.80s]  All right, let's go.
[12967.88s -> 12968.52s]  Sorry.
[12968.52s -> 12970.60s]  Sorry about that.
[12970.60s -> 12971.48s]  Sorry about that.
[12971.48s -> 12971.80s]  OK.

[12976.73s -> 12977.69s]  Soy boy.
[12977.69s -> 12978.89s]  Thanks for the five community subs.
[12980.22s -> 12991.82s]  They like me better.
[12991.82s -> 12993.26s]  I got way more charisma than you.
[13000.65s -> 13002.81s]  37,000 back in gold, dude.
[13002.81s -> 13005.53s]  37,000 back in gold, dude.
[13005.53s -> 13007.39s]  Need more stamina.
[13008.76s -> 13009.16s]  I'll do.
[13009.16s -> 13010.60s]  I'm going to just load into stamina after this.
[13022.86s -> 13023.98s]  No more charisma.
[13023.98s -> 13024.78s]  More charisma.
[13024.78s -> 13025.28s]  What?
[13026.62s -> 13034.68s]  One more.
[13034.68s -> 13037.61s]  One more.
[13037.61s -> 13039.64s]  All right, bang.
[13039.64s -> 13040.51s]  Got him.
[13041.23s -> 13042.77s]  4,400.
[13043.41s -> 13047.02s]  No, just do more charisma.
[13047.02s -> 13047.66s]  Yeah, but I don't.
[13047.66s -> 13048.86s]  I want to be able to land.
[13049.58s -> 13050.66s]  I don't know, man.
[13050.66s -> 13051.38s]  That seems kind of like.
[13052.98s -> 13055.14s]  Am I going to beat this whole game by yelling at people?
[13055.70s -> 13058.86s]  How can you stomach playing this for two hours?
[13058.86s -> 13059.42s]  I don't know.
[13059.42s -> 13060.06s]  Kind of just fun.
[13060.78s -> 13062.35s]  I've been having a good time.
[13064.29s -> 13065.09s]  I'm just chilling, man.
[13065.09s -> 13065.57s]  I'm just having.
[13065.57s -> 13066.85s]  I'm just hanging out having a good time.
[13067.89s -> 13069.01s]  We're just chilling today.
[13070.86s -> 13071.42s]  It's fun.
[13071.42s -> 13072.06s]  Yeah, it's fun.
[13072.78s -> 13079.14s]  How dare you stop enjoying this?
[13082.27s -> 13083.79s]  Just chill, screaming and farting
[13083.79s -> 13088.32s]  and yelling and losing to the first tutorial boss for an hour.
[13088.32s -> 13088.96s]  You know?
[13088.96s -> 13099.12s]  All right, this guy's got shout protection too.
[13099.12s -> 13100.00s]  There it is.
[13100.00s -> 13110.11s]  What is the last level in this game?
[13110.11s -> 13111.31s]  How hard does it go?
[13111.31s -> 13113.26s]  He's a little too close.
[13117.82s -> 13118.70s]  Goes forever.
[13125.41s -> 13126.29s]  Don't let him do that.
[13126.29s -> 13126.79s]  Okay.
[13127.49s -> 13129.54s]  All right, I got to level up here.
[13130.50s -> 13131.94s]  I'm thinking you get a new quiver.
[13132.50s -> 13132.98s]  Whatever.
[13132.98s -> 13137.58s]  I'm thinking charisma and defense.
[13138.38s -> 13140.30s]  Or stamina.
[13140.30s -> 13141.18s]  Or actually magic.
[13143.49s -> 13145.01s]  Stamina and charisma.
[13145.01s -> 13150.26s]  Okay.
[13150.26s -> 13152.13s]  All right, it's tournament time.
[13152.13s -> 13154.11s]  Tournament time.
[13154.11s -> 13155.23s]  What can I upgrade here?
[13155.23s -> 13155.79s]  Breastplate.
[13158.67s -> 13159.39s]  Can't do that yet.
[13160.66s -> 13161.62s]  How about a new helmet?
[13161.62s -> 13162.42s]  No.
[13162.42s -> 13165.02s]  I'm going to get...
[13165.74s -> 13167.44s]  What about boots?
[13167.44s -> 13167.94s]  No.
[13169.86s -> 13170.50s]  Chin guards?
[13171.14s -> 13172.64s]  No.
[13172.64s -> 13173.76s]  Greaves?
[13173.76s -> 13175.07s]  No.
[13175.07s -> 13176.03s]  Gauntlets?
[13176.03s -> 13178.61s]  Shield?
[13178.61s -> 13180.19s]  No.
[13180.19s -> 13181.39s]  Shoulders are the only thing I can do.
[13185.01s -> 13185.65s]  Okay.
[13185.65s -> 13188.61s]  All right.
[13188.61s -> 13189.41s]  You get the discount.
[13189.41s -> 13190.45s]  Try to buy it.
[13190.45s -> 13193.95s]  Wait, what?
[13193.95s -> 13194.91s]  Oh, shit.
[13194.91s -> 13197.42s]  Would you look at that?
[13197.42s -> 13198.06s]  Oh, well.
[13198.06s -> 13200.90s]  We'll come back.
[13200.90s -> 13201.30s]  Potions?
[13201.30s -> 13202.10s]  I can't buy potions.
[13202.10s -> 13202.58s]  I don't need them.
[13203.14s -> 13204.00s]  I don't need them.
[13213.49s -> 13216.00s]  I don't need them and I can't buy them anyways.
[13216.00s -> 13228.67s]  This game looks better than Watch Dogs.
[13230.74s -> 13231.06s]  I mean...
[13233.06s -> 13233.78s]  God.
[13233.78s -> 13234.42s]  That game.
[13234.42s -> 13235.46s]  I swear to God.
[13237.18s -> 13237.42s]  That's...
[13237.42s -> 13237.98s]  Okay.
[13237.98s -> 13239.58s]  That's not nominated for anything.
[13239.58s -> 13240.46s]  Are the game awards right?
[13241.02s -> 13243.14s]  Is that nominated for even one award?
[13244.48s -> 13245.60s]  I hope not.
[13245.60s -> 13246.32s]  Is it?
[13246.32s -> 13246.80s]  No, it's not.
[13246.80s -> 13248.56s]  What is it nominated for?
[13249.20s -> 13251.04s]  No, it is not.
[13251.04s -> 13251.68s]  Bullshit.
[13251.68s -> 13252.72s]  What's it nominated for?
[13252.72s -> 13253.12s]  Tell me.
[13253.12s -> 13254.24s]  It's not nominated for the game of the year.
[13254.24s -> 13255.42s]  No, it's not.
[13255.42s -> 13255.82s]  Nothing.
[13255.82s -> 13256.06s]  Good.
[13256.70s -> 13265.36s]  Where'd he go?
[13265.36s -> 13266.00s]  Oh, he's...
[13267.70s -> 13278.74s]  Remember, I worked so hard on that game.
[13278.74s -> 13278.98s]  Stop.
[13278.98s -> 13279.62s]  Don't...
[13279.62s -> 13280.42s]  Hey.
[13280.42s -> 13280.90s]  That's not...
[13283.73s -> 13289.74s]  Dude, quit hitting your bong.
[13291.66s -> 13293.68s]  I don't think I could hit a bong, man.
[13293.68s -> 13295.04s]  I really don't think I could in real life.
[13295.04s -> 13296.64s]  I would probably fucking fall down.
[13297.28s -> 13300.46s]  I would hit the bong.
[13300.46s -> 13301.02s]  It'd be like...
[13309.60s -> 13311.39s]  I gotta be...
[13312.75s -> 13315.79s]  Because my head would just fucking hit the table.
[13316.43s -> 13317.39s]  I'm not doing that.
[13323.33s -> 13323.65s]  No.
[13323.65s -> 13325.57s]  I want to be able to control exactly what I'm doing.
[13325.57s -> 13326.77s]  I'm back to how much I'm taking.
[13331.57s -> 13339.78s]  Yeah, and why did I just do that like I was eating spaghetti?
[13339.78s -> 13342.75s]  That was not a good bong sound.
[13342.75s -> 13345.63s]  That was like you're slipping up like spaghetti and meatballs.
[13345.63s -> 13348.38s]  What is that?
[13350.72s -> 13354.26s]  This is...
[13355.22s -> 13355.62s]  This is not...
[13355.62s -> 13356.74s]  I'm not even having fun.
[13356.74s -> 13358.10s]  This is just like screaming.
[13358.90s -> 13359.22s]  I'm not...
[13359.22s -> 13360.18s]  I feel like I'm not even playing.
[13360.18s -> 13361.78s]  I'm just like looking at you guys and talking.
[13364.82s -> 13367.70s]  I've kept my mouth in the same place, I think, for the last
[13367.70s -> 13368.74s]  four or five straight minutes.
[13376.16s -> 13378.94s]  Play Doodle God?
[13378.94s -> 13381.34s]  Oh, I played the absolute hell out of that a long time ago.
[13383.02s -> 13390.32s]  Okay, Son of Stylonius.
[13391.36s -> 13391.84s]  Not yet.
[13392.40s -> 13402.99s]  Hey, Doodle God, right now.
[13403.87s -> 13405.10s]  Well, link it to me.
[13415.22s -> 13417.84s]  Turn off the stream.
[13417.84s -> 13418.08s]  What?
[13418.80s -> 13419.44s]  I'm not done yet.
[13425.73s -> 13432.03s]  Remember, he hits the bong and dies.
[13432.03s -> 13432.43s]  Hold on.
[13433.07s -> 13439.47s]  Remember, he hits the bong and dies.
[13439.47s -> 13440.11s]  Let's hear this.
[13440.99s -> 13443.23s]  Curious.
[13460.30s -> 13462.06s]  Not what I intended for that to sound like.
[13462.06s -> 13463.34s]  I wanted that to sound like this.
[13464.22s -> 13466.58s]  I wanted it to sound like this.
[13467.38s -> 13470.93s]  For some reason, when I go through the stream,
[13471.94s -> 13476.11s]  I don't know why, but I'm going to leave it on this for a little while.
[13479.22s -> 13481.30s]  Hold on.
[13481.30s -> 13481.86s]  Is it?
[13481.86s -> 13482.90s]  Let's find out.
[13482.90s -> 13484.64s]  Let me find out.
[13484.64s -> 13485.68s]  Let me find out if it's...
[13485.68s -> 13486.48s]  Let me find out.
[13486.48s -> 13487.52s]  Let me find out.
[13488.48s -> 13491.66s]  Now, let me tell you.
[13491.66s -> 13492.30s]  I am not...
[13493.42s -> 13496.62s]  Madam Secretary, I am not going to stand down here
[13496.62s -> 13497.98s]  and not give a stimulus.
[13498.54s -> 13499.18s]  No, no.
[13499.18s -> 13501.18s]  The American people are going to be just fine.
[13501.18s -> 13501.98s]  They're going to be fine.
[13506.78s -> 13509.66s]  Mitch McConnell has a joker laugh, by the way.
[13509.66s -> 13512.37s]  Listen to Mitch McConnell laugh at something.
[13512.37s -> 13514.21s]  He does the Jared Leto joker.
[13516.82s -> 13517.46s]  Seriously, it's like...
[13519.90s -> 13523.36s]  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
[13523.36s -> 13530.54s]  How do you laugh like that?
[13531.10s -> 13533.92s]  Think about it, people that...
[13533.92s -> 13534.96s]  You know, when you laugh, you just go...
[13535.52s -> 13535.92s]  Or like...
[13541.47s -> 13546.94s]  Is that political?
[13546.94s -> 13549.46s]  Political.
[13552.59s -> 13559.82s]  All right, here he comes.
[13560.46s -> 13561.90s]  Son of Stylonius.
[13562.46s -> 13563.95s]  Scream at him.
[13563.95s -> 13564.67s]  I win.
[13564.67s -> 13565.31s]  Scream at him.
[13565.31s -> 13566.11s]  I win.
[13566.11s -> 13566.75s]  Scream at him.
[13566.75s -> 13567.23s]  I win.
[13567.23s -> 13567.79s]  Nice fart.
[13567.79s -> 13569.15s]  I can match your fart with a fart, too.
[13569.15s -> 13570.03s]  You want to get farts on?
[13570.03s -> 13570.43s]  All right, fine.
[13570.43s -> 13570.83s]  Let's go.
[13571.71s -> 13581.33s]  Oh, he's charging something.
[13582.05s -> 13582.45s]  Nice.
[13582.45s -> 13583.25s]  Okay, you missed.
[13584.21s -> 13596.34s]  People are wildly entertained by that, too.
[13596.34s -> 13597.22s]  Oh, he's burnt.
[13603.06s -> 13607.23s]  Piss on him.
[13607.23s -> 13608.67s]  You can't even pee on people in this game.
[13609.63s -> 13611.07s]  And if you can, I don't know.
[13611.07s -> 13612.35s]  I'm not going to probably unlock it yet.
[13625.70s -> 13626.42s]  I won.
[13626.42s -> 13630.29s]  Congratulations, you have won.
[13632.93s -> 13637.30s]  I kind of feel like I have not been in the arena yet.
[13639.63s -> 13640.27s]  Okay.
[13640.27s -> 13643.31s]  Emperor Antares has granted you 22,500 gold.
[13644.11s -> 13650.18s]  The hour is late.
[13650.18s -> 13651.54s]  Okay, find a tavern.
[13651.54s -> 13652.42s]  Sleep peacefully.
[13665.94s -> 13666.82s]  All right, that was fun.
[13666.82s -> 13668.26s]  I'm going to move on to Doodle God now.
[13668.82s -> 13670.74s]  Let's move on.
[13670.74s -> 13671.54s]  Let's do Doodle God.
[13672.10s -> 13673.70s]  Yeah, this game is cool.
[13673.70s -> 13674.98s]  But like, I don't know.
[13674.98s -> 13677.06s]  I don't want to just yell at people for another hour or something.
[13678.30s -> 13678.86s]  That's too much.
[13680.46s -> 13680.86s]  I like it.
[13680.86s -> 13681.66s]  It's a really fun game.
[13681.66s -> 13682.38s]  And I remember it.
[13682.38s -> 13683.26s]  It's very nostalgic.
[13684.70s -> 13690.85s]  But we are going to do this.
[13692.38s -> 13693.02s]  Doodle God.
[13695.18s -> 13696.30s]  I remember this game.
[13697.79s -> 13700.69s]  Might be a little too big.
[13700.69s -> 13703.65s]  Let's make it a little bit smaller.
[13705.25s -> 13706.37s]  Okay, a little.
[13706.37s -> 13707.09s]  Just a little.
[13707.09s -> 13707.57s]  Okay.
[13707.57s -> 13711.33s]  Remember, you normally just yell at us for hours.
[13711.33s -> 13712.05s]  What?
[13712.05s -> 13712.90s]  I don't.
[13712.90s -> 13713.46s]  You do that to me.
[13714.18s -> 13716.05s]  All right, Doodle God, play.
[13716.93s -> 13719.58s]  You can now play Doodle God on your phone.
[13719.58s -> 13720.22s]  Check it out.
[13720.22s -> 13722.54s]  iPhone version has priority in getting updates.
[13723.26s -> 13726.67s]  In the beginning, there was only Doodle God.
[13726.67s -> 13730.98s]  Doodle God created the four basic elements.
[13730.98s -> 13732.82s]  Earth, water, fire, air.
[13733.70s -> 13737.30s]  From Earth, Doodle God created the planets.
[13737.30s -> 13743.71s]  From water, seas, and oceans were created.
[13744.58s -> 13747.62s]  From fire were created volcanoes and other stuff.
[13748.34s -> 13751.46s]  From air, you know, the world is still vast.
[13751.46s -> 13752.34s]  I know what the game is.
[13753.06s -> 13753.70s]  Okay, here we go.
[13754.50s -> 13758.26s]  We're going to do we're going to do fire and we're going to do Earth.
[13758.90s -> 13762.90s]  And that is going to make stone lava.
[13764.02s -> 13767.22s]  If your heart is a volcano, how shall you expect flowers to bloom?
[13767.22s -> 13768.02s]  They get quotes.
[13768.66s -> 13769.62s]  Okay, cool.
[13769.62s -> 13771.38s]  There's a new element in the group now.
[13773.66s -> 13774.30s]  Yeah, there is.
[13774.30s -> 13775.26s]  Now we have lava.
[13775.82s -> 13778.14s]  We can do lava and Earth.
[13778.14s -> 13782.37s]  Earth and lava equals the same thing Earth and fire do.
[13782.37s -> 13785.97s]  How about air and lava, steam, stone?
[13789.98s -> 13794.40s]  We have stone and water equals sand.
[13798.40s -> 13798.80s]  Cool.
[13798.80s -> 13804.27s]  Now we can do let's do air, air and sand.
[13805.55s -> 13808.43s]  Air and Earth creates dust.
[13809.79s -> 13821.17s]  How about fire and sand makes glass?
[13821.17s -> 13822.53s]  I know that from Minecraft.
[13823.17s -> 13824.99s]  I know that from Minecraft.
[13825.79s -> 13827.79s]  Teaching children all these things too.
[13827.79s -> 13829.63s]  Don't forget that your little brother plays Minecraft.
[13830.27s -> 13832.32s]  It's teaching him things.
[13832.32s -> 13838.64s]  Dust and glass, dust and stone, dust and sand, dust and Earth, air and dust.
[13840.70s -> 13843.82s]  Air and water, steam.
[13844.78s -> 13845.26s]  There it is.
[13849.73s -> 13854.62s]  How about steam and fire equals plasma?
[13856.24s -> 13857.28s]  Glass and steam.
[13863.06s -> 13866.26s]  Fire and steam, fire and dust is ash.
[13866.90s -> 13868.69s]  Who suggested this?
[13868.69s -> 13869.33s]  I don't know, man.
[13869.33s -> 13870.29s]  We're just jumping around.
[13871.09s -> 13872.86s]  We're just hanging out.
[13876.40s -> 13881.60s]  Sand and steam, stone and ash, Earth and ash, Earth and steam.
[13882.58s -> 13892.53s]  Dust and glass, steam and sand, water and ash, water and dust, water and steam, water and air,
[13893.57s -> 13893.89s]  steam.
[13895.17s -> 13896.37s]  Turn off the game sounds.
[13897.86s -> 13898.66s]  All right.
[13898.66s -> 13899.78s]  You don't like them?
[13899.78s -> 13901.54s]  You're too loud.
[13905.02s -> 13914.59s]  Okay, Earth, sand and sand, sand and stone.
[13914.59s -> 13916.80s]  Play nitrome.
[13916.80s -> 13918.08s]  What is nitrome?
[13918.08s -> 13920.08s]  Nitrome now, nitrome now.
[13920.08s -> 13921.44s]  Let me at least get to plasma.
[13924.43s -> 13933.15s]  Fire and, fire and steam, fire and water is alcohol.
[13934.74s -> 13938.96s]  Alcohol and, alcohol and water.
[13939.68s -> 13942.00s]  Okay, alcohol and a ton of water.
[13943.07s -> 13943.71s]  Spotlight.
[13944.35s -> 13953.30s]  What is nitrome?
[13953.30s -> 13953.78s]  I don't get it.
[13958.16s -> 13961.52s]  Lava and vodka makes fireball.
[13962.32s -> 13965.84s]  I'm sorry, I had to.
[13971.01s -> 13972.53s]  High quality indie game.
[13972.53s -> 13973.81s]  What is, okay, nitrome.
[13973.81s -> 13975.25s]  Is it on, where is it?
[13976.05s -> 13979.12s]  What about glass and alcohol?
[13979.68s -> 13982.08s]  This is like, well, that's just, that doesn't make any sense.
[13982.08s -> 13982.96s]  Alcohol and sand.
[13983.98s -> 13984.86s]  Alcohol and Earth.
[13988.05s -> 13990.77s]  Fire and alcohol makes bomb, energy.

[19516.40s -> 19517.52s]  Is it water and metal?
[19517.52s -> 19519.28s]  That can't be the last one that I didn't do.
[19520.00s -> 19523.74s]  No way.
[19523.74s -> 19523.98s]  Okay.
[19524.54s -> 19527.87s]  Do zombie and wizard.
[19537.50s -> 19538.46s]  Vampire wizard?
[19539.85s -> 19540.65s]  Ghost wizard?
[19541.53s -> 19541.93s]  Zombie...
[19542.57s -> 19544.06s]  I don't know.
[19544.06s -> 19549.36s]  Vodka plus firearm.
[19549.36s -> 19550.16s]  Oh, okay.
[19556.30s -> 19557.34s]  Zombie and corpse.
[19563.20s -> 19563.60s]  Is it?
[19566.70s -> 19567.98s]  Oh, there it is!
[19569.61s -> 19570.65s]  That's the end of the game.
[19572.73s -> 19573.13s]  Ghoul.
[19574.01s -> 19574.97s]  Congratulations.
[19576.16s -> 19577.44s]  In the next episodes,
[19577.44s -> 19579.92s]  which path will the development of the world creation take?
[19579.92s -> 19581.92s]  What other fantastic adventures will Doodle God make?
[19582.56s -> 19586.54s]  Maybe technological disaster will throw the world into stone age.
[19586.54s -> 19588.06s]  What creatures will inhabit the planet?
[19588.06s -> 19591.50s]  Or maybe world will take the path of magic.
[19592.14s -> 19594.56s]  Perhaps the Doodle God himself will descend from heavens
[19595.20s -> 19596.72s]  and take on adventures personally.
[19598.99s -> 19600.75s]  You can now play it on your iPhone, by the way.
[19603.87s -> 19605.79s]  There are like five of these.
[19608.72s -> 19609.92s]  Yeah, there's like Doodle Devil,
[19609.92s -> 19612.96s]  this is Doodle Medieval, Doodle Doodle Magic or something, right?
[19613.76s -> 19616.83s]  That was fun.
[19616.83s -> 19617.31s]  That was fun.
[19617.31s -> 19618.51s]  That was very chill and just...
[19618.51s -> 19619.79s]  That was really fun just to hang out.
[19624.62s -> 19632.96s]  Okay, I promise everybody that I will play Nitrome this week, okay?
[19632.96s -> 19635.80s]  We'll go back to it.
[19635.80s -> 19638.91s]  But I am going to call it here.
[19638.91s -> 19640.43s]  It's been five and a half hours.
[19640.43s -> 19641.47s]  It hasn't really felt that long.
[19642.11s -> 19648.56s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for the game awards.
[19649.20s -> 19652.48s]  Stream will be starting somewhere around like 3 15.
[19653.28s -> 19655.12s]  We'll hang out for like 15 minutes before it starts.
[19655.68s -> 19658.11s]  We'll do that.
[19658.11s -> 19661.48s]  And then we'll see what's going on on Friday.
[19661.48s -> 19665.88s]  But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[19665.88s -> 19668.32s]  Yeah, game awards are tomorrow.
[19668.32s -> 19670.72s]  I'm only watching the game awards for Elden Ring.
[19670.72s -> 19672.16s]  I don't care about anything else.
[19672.16s -> 19674.17s]  I'm just going to sleep through it until...
[19674.17s -> 19677.13s]  I have like an alert on my phone when the announcement is coming.
[19677.13s -> 19683.52s]  There's probably some other cool reveals too.
[19683.52s -> 19684.00s]  There might be.
[19684.00s -> 19688.01s]  We'll see.
[19688.01s -> 19689.69s]  That's going to conclude tonight's stream.
[19689.69s -> 19690.49s]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[19690.49s -> 19691.69s]  Sorry I was gone for so long.
[19693.48s -> 19695.08s]  I just wasn't able to talk.
[19695.16s -> 19697.56s]  It really took until about this morning
[19697.56s -> 19700.60s]  before I felt comfortable speaking for more than like an hour straight.
[19700.60s -> 19703.44s]  So we unban that guy?
[19703.44s -> 19705.12s]  That guy should be unbanned by now, right?
[19705.12s -> 19712.88s]  Send him a DM like and just say, hey, you got noticed.
[19714.75s -> 19716.35s]  No, he's still banned.
[19716.35s -> 19717.69s]  He's still banned.
[19726.40s -> 19727.20s]  Well, okay.
[19727.20s -> 19732.91s]  Maybe he'll be unbanned tomorrow.
[19732.91s -> 19733.47s]  All right.
[19733.47s -> 19742.06s]  So raid, raid.
[19742.06s -> 19742.54s]  Okay.
[19742.54s -> 19742.94s]  Raid.
[19742.94s -> 19743.34s]  You want...
[19743.98s -> 19744.70s]  Is Dunkey...
[19744.70s -> 19745.82s]  Dunkey is streaming now, right?
[19746.46s -> 19747.98s]  But I'm such like a fan.
[19747.98s -> 19749.18s]  Like if I stream...
[19749.18s -> 19750.54s]  If I raid Dunkey...
[19750.86s -> 19752.94s]  I could be like, oh, it's Dunkey.
[19752.94s -> 19753.66s]  I'm such a big fan.
[19753.66s -> 19754.86s]  And here's like a bunch of people.
[19764.17s -> 19765.61s]  Yeah, Dunkey's really funny.
[19765.61s -> 19766.89s]  He's been around for a long time.
[19766.89s -> 19769.53s]  If you don't know who he is, he's very, very funny.
[19769.53s -> 19772.51s]  He's got some of the funniest YouTube videos I've ever watched.
[19773.07s -> 19775.40s]  One of my favorites is the capture video.
[19775.40s -> 19777.16s]  If you haven't seen it, please give yourself a treat
[19777.16s -> 19779.72s]  and go watch it right now before you, you know, watch the stream.
[19779.72s -> 19783.32s]  We're going to raid Dunkey.
[19783.32s -> 19785.56s]  Look, I'm just a fan.
[19785.56s -> 19786.20s]  Whatever.
[19786.20s -> 19786.60s]  He's cool.
[19786.60s -> 19787.16s]  Whatever.
[19787.16s -> 19791.48s]  What is this?
[19791.48s -> 19792.52s]  I got to follow him on Twitch.
[19792.52s -> 19793.72s]  What is his Twitch name?
[19793.72s -> 19799.77s]  I got to follow him right now.
[19799.77s -> 19802.36s]  Dunkstream.
[19802.36s -> 19802.92s]  Oh, yeah.
[19802.92s -> 19808.46s]  He's had this account for a long time, hasn't he?
[19808.46s -> 19808.70s]  All right.
[19808.70s -> 19809.90s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[19809.90s -> 19811.42s]  Have a good one.
[19811.42s -> 19811.90s]  Take care.
[19811.90s -> 19812.46s]  Good night.
[19812.46s -> 19813.10s]  Goodbye.
[19813.10s -> 19815.24s]  See you tomorrow for the game awards.
[19815.24s -> 19816.60s]  Goodbye.
[19816.60s -> 19820.43s]  Get that raid going.
[19821.61s -> 19828.24s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[19828.24s -> 19829.44s]  I'm looking forward to the game awards.
[19829.44s -> 19831.72s]  I think it's going to be some cool stuff there.
[19831.72s -> 19832.28s]  I don't know.
[19832.28s -> 19833.24s]  We'll see.
[19833.24s -> 19836.96s]  Good night, guys.
[19836.96s -> 19838.32s]  Thanks for watching, as always.
[19838.32s -> 19840.78s]  See you soon.
