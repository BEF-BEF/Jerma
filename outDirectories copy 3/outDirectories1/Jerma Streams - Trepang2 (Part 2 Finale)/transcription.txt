[64.06s -> 77.30s]  Hello there. How's it going? How you been? I can finally finish laundry now. Ooh laundry day.
[77.30s -> 86.31s]  All right. Sunflower reveal. Oh yeah. Not right now. I'm gonna have to make you wait for it.
[86.31s -> 95.91s]  You're gonna have to wait around for it. That's we're doing that at the end of the stream.
[95.91s -> 106.90s]  I keep my engagements up the whole day. Now good to see you. I go over the plan this week.
[107.46s -> 114.18s]  We'll talk about it. Are you gonna play Pikmin 4? Since you loved 2 so much. Um,
[117.22s -> 127.24s]  I don't know. I'd like to play Pikmin 4 but I don't know. Maybe not on stream. I don't. Everyone
[127.24s -> 134.06s]  thinks I hate Pikmin in the whole franchise. I don't. You're referring to complaints I had
[134.06s -> 143.56s]  about the Wiimote and how I was annoyed at the Wiimote controls. That's what that was. I really
[143.56s -> 150.09s]  enjoy Pikmin. I think it's a great franchise. I think it's an amazing group of video games.
[150.09s -> 158.38s]  I just had an issue with the way the Wiimote was. Okay. He hates Pikmin. Yeah whatever. All
[158.38s -> 163.86s]  right so here's the plan. Today I'm gonna finish Trippang 2. Just gonna play it and hang out.
[165.96s -> 173.75s]  I'm at the last mission but there are at least three or four side missions. I'd like to do at
[173.75s -> 181.14s]  least a few of them. There's also wacky cheat codes that I would like to do. So we're not
[181.14s -> 190.76s]  quite done with Trippang yet. This Sunday, the plan this Sunday is, well I actually forgot to
[190.76s -> 197.48s]  tell you too, and we're gonna go over the sunflowers. It's not just sunflowers by the way. We went ham
[197.48s -> 207.00s]  this year. We got marigolds. We got wildflowers. We got sunflowers. There's a whole fucking ecosystem
[207.56s -> 220.92s]  over here. You raised pigs. All right so yeah we'll do that. I'm very proud of what we've done.
[221.56s -> 227.45s]  They look wonderful. You said you're gonna play viewfinder when it comes out. It's out right now.
[228.94s -> 236.10s]  I'm gonna give you the what's what's happening on Sunday. Let me talk. On Sunday
[239.10s -> 248.22s]  I'm gonna play Team Fortress 2. Gonna play TF2 on Sunday. I'm gonna just kind of see. I'm gonna gauge
[248.22s -> 254.74s]  kind of how I like it. I'm interested in checking it out. I did mention a month or two ago at least
[255.46s -> 263.06s]  that I've had the itch to play like man versus machine TF2. So why not? Why not do it on Sunday?
[264.66s -> 269.37s]  We're gonna play it for like an hour or two, get back into the swing of things,
[269.93s -> 276.84s]  see if I like it, and maybe I'll keep playing it. After that we're gonna play viewfinder. So we'll
[276.84s -> 284.04s]  give it a little we'll give it a little try this Sunday. Not on Sunday. That's the day I'm watching
[284.04s -> 293.58s]  Barbie. Oh sorry. That's the plan. That's gonna be the worst stream of the year.
[297.35s -> 320.42s]  Why? I don't think you like TF2 then. Of the whole year? Why? What the heck? Is
[320.42s -> 333.56s]  Gunu gonna make another debut? No. Gunu is in one game. You should ban him. Hey I'm that's just you
[333.56s -> 339.62s]  that's an opinion of the stream. That's an opinion of the stream. I cannot change that opinion.
[340.18s -> 351.43s]  I can just scream at you. Okay anyways you guys ready? Last mission. I don't think I'm
[351.43s -> 357.51s]  gonna do the last mission yet. I think it's probably a good idea too because I haven't
[357.51s -> 361.21s]  played in like a week or two. I think it's a good idea. Is this good? Let's see if it's too loud.
[361.21s -> 374.90s]  Is it too loud? Can we check? How is that? Is that bad? That's all right. Shotgun's a little louder.
[374.90s -> 380.82s]  Seems all right. All right let me remember the buttons. I got that's the slide. That's grenade.
[381.66s -> 392.17s]  That's obviously that. H is to do well. I got Q is I believe slow down time and F is cloak. Okay I'm
[392.17s -> 404.30s]  good. We want to hear your loudest scream. I don't think I can't scream loud. Anytime I scream try to
[404.30s -> 412.94s]  scream loud or anything if I ever try to it just kind of goes oh it just kind of turns into like
[412.94s -> 418.94s]  an air horn that you press too hard like or like a you know what I mean like my voice just breaks
[418.94s -> 431.83s]  when I try to yell. You turn into a toy chicken. Yeah that's what I mean. All right so I'm not
[431.83s -> 438.02s]  going to do the final mission. I have been told that prep hang two has some really really good
[438.02s -> 443.74s]  side content side missions. We're going to take a look. We haven't done any of them. We've done
[444.38s -> 459.43s]  none of them. So what is left for us to do? Wait didn't I do this? Didn't I do site 83? Did it not
[459.43s -> 473.51s]  save? Is one of these new? Yeah it did. Green is the side missions. Yeah but is this shouldn't there
[473.51s -> 477.43s]  be shouldn't this one be open? Oh wait no that's also a side mission. All right so where's the
[477.43s -> 486.14s]  campaign mission? Where's the next camp? This one here then. Okay that's the one that's blinking.
[486.14s -> 494.44s]  All right let's do let's do crash site. Destroy the crashed plane's cargo or unidentified structure
[494.44s -> 498.66s]  in the United States. Which one of these is good? People said there's a couple of really good ones.
[498.66s -> 512.58s]  This one here unidentified structure. Oh yeah let's go. Satellites tracked three armed individuals
[512.58s -> 518.92s]  running in separate directions from the structure this morning at 3 30 a.m. I know how to read it.
[519.00s -> 526.41s]  Identified as Horizon from their uniforms. By 8 20 a.m. all three had expired from exhaustion
[526.41s -> 531.53s]  or exposure to the elements. Investigate the structure. Satellite scans initially detected
[531.53s -> 536.33s]  four or five. All right so we just go investigate the structure. I got it. We're doing it on hard.
[536.33s -> 555.34s]  We plan on hard. I'm good to go. Don't call the sus guy at 3 30 a.m. You can read a clock pog.
[555.34s -> 564.02s]  It gets a little weird once you go over. Okay once you once you go over I think 1800 hours.
[564.66s -> 575.40s]  My brain has trouble because okay oh 600 hours. That's 6 a.m. 1200 that's noon. Okay 1300 is one.
[575.40s -> 582.20s]  1400 is two. 15 is all right 1500 is three. 1600 hours is four. You know what I mean? It's
[582.20s -> 585.40s]  already I'm already I got it already fucked up already. I already I already have it fucked up
[585.40s -> 591.45s]  already is literally just everything minus 12. Yeah but I don't want to do any math. I don't
[591.45s -> 600.02s]  want to do math. I am an a.m. p.m. Andy because like I just I don't know. It's just easier for
[600.02s -> 612.52s]  my brain to understand. American. I'm an a.m. p.m. Andy. I am. Are you scared that the sus guy
[612.52s -> 619.14s]  in quotes is going to be uttered at your funeral? No no I don't I don't think so. I don't think
[619.14s -> 623.62s]  that's happening. I think it's going to be more about like hey like let's that no one's going to
[623.62s -> 636.30s]  talk about the sus guy at my funeral. I'm not even going to give that one a response. Okay what
[636.30s -> 643.80s]  guns do I want to take? I actually like these two. I like shotgun and I like um but should I
[643.80s -> 656.54s]  take the sniper? Give me armor. Give me flash bangs. Bolt launcher was pretty sick especially
[656.54s -> 667.54s]  when you do this. All right I'm going to take this and then also this. I like the smg. I'm going to
[667.54s -> 681.38s]  do dual smgs. I take this with me right? I think so. Are you going to add derma dumpy butt naked
[681.38s -> 688.42s]  emote? Uh I thought about it but no. I'm just thinking like what how much um what it would do
[688.42s -> 699.94s]  for me. All right let's go. All right let's turn the audio up for me. Test one more time.
[699.94s -> 717.19s]  Jump button works. All right let's go. Why do you read the worst chat messages? Sometimes what you
[717.19s -> 723.37s]  think is the worst chat message to me is something that I think is funny to read out loud. So I mean
[723.37s -> 727.69s]  there's that. But there's also here's the problem. You also don't want to make it. You don't want to
[727.69s -> 731.69s]  make it a thing where it's like oh I'm going to read I'm going to read like the wacky comment
[731.69s -> 738.25s]  out loud because then you start getting copycats. Oh I he's got to read my message. I'm going to say
[738.25s -> 744.49s]  something fucking crazy. That's why I can't tell you the secret sauce because then you know you
[744.49s -> 756.57s]  got to have it naturally. All right so the goal is there's people in this building or they ran away
[756.57s -> 762.68s]  from this building. Is there something in here? Is there like a monster? Let's find out. That scared the
[762.68s -> 770.55s]  fuck out of me. I forgot how loud that was. You could even see my mouse move. Did it move? Did I
[770.55s -> 776.89s]  go like okay whatever. Turn that down. Okay I'm gonna I actually am because that was pretty bad.
[778.78s -> 791.51s]  This should be all right. What's this? To patrol team when you're back meet us at the vault entrance.
[791.51s -> 795.83s]  We haven't heard from the eggheads in two days. The vault is locked. We're gonna breach it and
[795.83s -> 816.04s]  check. Can I break into this? Yeah what's in here? Okay this is kind of this is like a safe room.
[816.04s -> 831.72s]  There's the burp. Oh do I want to take this? I'm happy with these. It's a gamer room.
[831.72s -> 844.15s]  Or kind of as a gamer room. It's all right. Go down. This is gonna be a monster that's in here
[844.15s -> 847.27s]  somewhere. This is gonna be the monster going into the fridge and like drinking out of the
[847.27s -> 877.38s]  fucking milk. I'm gonna catch him and it's gonna go. What was that? What the fuck was that?
[878.90s -> 885.43s]  I'm not even scared. All right what does this say? Feeling uncertain about any progress. The others
[885.43s -> 892.17s]  are mostly keeping me in the dark but had a good conversation with Dr Partridge yesterday. He seemed
[892.17s -> 897.61s]  unusually interested in my books especially the ones pertaining to my faith. I lent him an entire
[897.61s -> 914.50s]  bag of books to satiate his curiosity. It will be interesting to chat with him next time. I'm going
[914.50s -> 930.33s]  I'm taking this one out first. I okay I'm very aware of my nose right now and I hate it. You know
[930.33s -> 935.83s]  you know exactly what I'm talking about right? Right now in the game I'm very aware of my nose
[935.83s -> 944.68s]  and it's I'm looking down at it. I can see it. I can see my nose right there. Oh what the hell.
[944.68s -> 953.00s]  More intel. In game? Yeah in game but also that that's kind of what happens in real life. When
[953.00s -> 965.62s]  you become aware of your nose. Just wait it is just right there. I can see it. Big nose gang. I kind
[965.62s -> 979.54s]  of have a big nose. Yeah all right first sign of blood. What's going on here? Okay trial and error.
[979.54s -> 985.38s]  We've just decrypted the data encoded within the DNA of the biomass sample. The biomass exhibits
[985.46s -> 994.12s]  a remarkable ability to alter its own genomic sequence in response to the input data. Okay
[994.12s -> 1000.47s]  limited internet access. The lack of availability training is okay. Mechanism underlying the
[1000.47s -> 1008.63s]  encryption scheme employed by the biomass is unusual. Okay I don't know why I don't know why
[1008.63s -> 1020.04s]  read this right to left down to up. Do you notice that is what I just did? That was kind of weird.
[1020.04s -> 1044.02s]  I don't know why I did it like that. All right well whatever this looks promising. Oh shit okay
[1044.02s -> 1056.60s]  is it gonna be like a weird person in here? Oh god what is oh that's the biomass.
[1058.63s -> 1069.53s]  This is kind of a maze. I'm gonna this something's gonna attack me. All right I gotta be ready.
[1069.53s -> 1100.25s]  Something growling like a coffin. System initializing training sequence with data set 41.
[1100.25s -> 1106.31s]  Unknown economic collapse poverty the end of civilization. Unknown the end is near. System
[1106.31s -> 1111.85s]  error unexpected output detected running diagnostics. The end is inevitable. Data corruption
[1111.85s -> 1118.06s]  identified data set 41. Contents replaced with unauthorized data by user A partridge. Unknown
[1118.06s -> 1124.30s]  apocalypse destruction the end of all things. Emergency such as everything's going absolutely.
[1125.66s -> 1156.31s]  This thing's moving. I put a fucking hole in its head. What do I do? Oh my god it's talking. All
[1156.31s -> 1170.81s]  right this thing over here is blinking. I'm gonna press this button. Shut it down. What the fuck is
[1170.81s -> 1185.34s]  happening? Did I win? This is gonna be some Slenderman bullshit. Look at there's like five
[1185.34s -> 1199.40s]  TVs to turn off. Oh my god I'm just gonna run. I think I'm just gonna run over there. This is
[1199.40s -> 1216.55s]  actually gonna be horrible isn't it? Just go go go go as fast as you can. Oh what's that? Is that a
[1216.55s -> 1233.54s]  pencil? What's this giant pencil? Why is there a giant goofy novelty pencil? Am I looking for that?
[1233.54s -> 1238.74s]  It's the spear from the spear gun. Oh okay all right all right all right all right.
[1240.66s -> 1252.36s]  The thing is huge. Fuck you game. All right I'm just running. Whatever.
[1259.35s -> 1277.53s]  Something's gonna be right here. Yeah nice spoiler auto save. Oh god I think this
[1277.53s -> 1303.27s]  goes for a grenade over here. There's one more TV right in the middle. This thing's gonna get up.
[1304.30s -> 1321.66s]  Oh okay okay okay okay okay. It's behind me. It's definitely right behind me. It's right behind me.
[1321.66s -> 1336.44s]  It's right behind me. What's going on? Why is everything so quiet? Why is everything so silent?
[1336.44s -> 1352.09s]  What's going on? That was scarier because it was so quiet. What do I do? This this no audio. Uh oh
[1352.09s -> 1395.27s]  I think I broke it. I don't know what I did. I think I'm dead. Where do I go? Let's go. Wait what
[1395.27s -> 1410.06s]  did that say? Shit. Okay I think I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I have to turn these off.
[1410.06s -> 1440.81s]  That's actually scarier than a loud sound. Just off-putting. All right is this it? There's only
[1440.81s -> 1478.70s]  one more. What the fuck was that sound? Turn it off. Got it. Do I fight that thing? Ah this sound.
[1478.70s -> 1529.16s]  I think I did it. Nothing else to do right? I don't have any ammo left. There's got to be
[1529.16s -> 1543.67s]  something else I have to do. Jump into it? I don't know. I don't know what to do. Leave now? I thought
[1543.67s -> 1557.08s]  the door is locked isn't it? Oh shit it's open. I this was locked. I have one bullet. Um oh god
[1557.08s -> 1573.98s]  they're behind me. Give me my audio back. There's nothing. There's no bullets in this gun either.
[1573.98s -> 1593.30s]  All right we're good. What the fuck is going on? What? Is this us? Is this us? Is this us? Is this
[1593.30s -> 1609.32s]  our team? Where are they? All right all right all right. You can't get in here. I got a lock on the
[1609.32s -> 1636.95s]  door. What are you doing? Turn it off. What the fuck? How many do you have? What does this do?
[1643.02s -> 1674.81s]  What? What? You? What the fuck just happened? Uh hey. Oh it's intel. Okay. PhD. Computer science. 62.
[1674.81s -> 1692.02s]  PhD. 46. PhD. Okay. Personnel list. All right. I gotta be ready. Okay this thing's dirty. Where's
[1692.02s -> 1720.36s]  he? Where's he? Where's he? Where the hell's this guy? Oh there he is. I just took out all your men.
[1720.36s -> 1729.59s]  I'm right here. I'm out here. This is that guy. That guy's a sniper. I'm literally standing still
[1729.59s -> 1739.90s]  and he can't even hit me. Who actually sucks at this game? Look at this. You can't even hit me.
[1739.90s -> 1775.42s]  All right. There we go. I'm going up top. This gotta be a sniper. What the fuck is happening?
[1775.42s -> 1808.86s]  Okay. Ow. What the fuck? They're at every angle. Single digit accuracy. Dude I'm being flanked at
[1808.86s -> 1830.76s]  all sides by guys in Omega armor. I'm going back. There's health in here. You can't even see me from
[1830.76s -> 1853.80s]  there. What is shooting? Well get in here then. Stop just firing. Get in here. What game are we
[1853.80s -> 1878.33s]  playing? I'm one person in here. Yeah. Shit. I need a sniper rifle. I can't shoot. They're all
[1878.33s -> 1886.38s]  surrounding me from every angle with laser pointers. I need a rifle. I have a weapon that
[1886.38s -> 1892.20s]  is effective at like 15 feet range and then this thing is empty. I gotta. I'm going up top.
[1892.76s -> 1902.89s]  Hurry. Go, go, go, go, go. Quick. I gotta get up there quick. All right. I want to go up, up, up,
[1902.89s -> 1926.92s]  up, up. But being outside is death. I need to go up. Who the fuck is this guy? I don't. This is
[1926.92s -> 1940.12s]  not even firing bullets, guys. What the? All right. Is there a rifle? There's gotta be a rifle
[1940.12s -> 1948.46s]  up here. It has to be. There's no way there's not a rifle up here. Is that a? Kind of? No. You.
[1949.75s -> 1964.55s]  What? Where's the rifle? You're holding a rifle? Ah, there we go. Now it's time for me to fuck up
[1964.55s -> 1976.41s]  everybody. Watch this. How do you aim? How do you zoom in? How do you, how do you zoom in with the
[1976.41s -> 2002.98s]  rifle? Anybody know how to zoom in? How do you zoom in? That's it? Oh, is it E? Where is this
[2003.06s -> 2011.74s]  guy? What's going on over here? What is going on over here? Why would they? I'm confused.
[2026.15s -> 2041.26s]  He's mad. No, I, that was really weird. Get this smoke out of my fucking eyes. This guy sucks.
[2042.31s -> 2057.13s]  I'm fighting an entire team of legendary warriors right now. Okay. Where are you? Where? What the
[2057.13s -> 2079.72s]  fuck are you doing though? Don't scare me. Dude, are you zonked right now? No, no. It's just this
[2079.80s -> 2099.72s]  every angle is people and this smoke every, I need a gun. I need a gun. I need a gun.
[2100.28s -> 2148.28s]  Give me a gun. This dude is so high right now. I, I know I'm not. Yeah. Got him. Anybody else?
[2148.28s -> 2169.72s]  What? All right. We're good. Who else? Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Here he comes.
[2169.72s -> 2175.78s]  Why is he so fast? Why is he so fast? Why is he so fast? What the fuck? There's so many people.
[2182.74s -> 2195.66s]  What the hell? So many people, dude. I got, oh my God. That guy was useless. I got him.
[2196.22s -> 2229.66s]  What was wrong with that guy? All right. We're good. All right. All right. All right. Oh my God.
[2246.01s -> 2274.62s]  When do I win? That's gotta be it. That's not it. There's more. This guy's got a grenade launcher.
[2274.62s -> 2309.35s]  Is that his head? You need to relax. Just a game. It's not just a game. It's an intense experience.
[2309.35s -> 2320.89s]  Can I have that grenade? Somebody said take the grenade launcher. Can I take it? That was intense.
[2320.89s -> 2343.13s]  He's literally on a secret mission. Well, it's a side mission. Did I do it? That was crazy.
[2343.13s -> 2366.82s]  Defend the fort. There's a gun mod in the house. I did see that. Where, was this thing armed?
[2366.82s -> 2394.10s]  It didn't go off. He was on top of a shelf. Yeah. That was a fun one. That was a good one.
[2394.10s -> 2397.37s]  What about the other side missions? Any other good ones?
[2399.72s -> 2429.67s]  Snipers bastard off the hbt board. Do the oil rig this way. What's going on in here? What the hell
[2429.67s -> 2449.08s]  was that? Well, actually, what was that? That was weird, wasn't it? Okay. Um, any more unlockables?
[2449.08s -> 2474.20s]  We keep the red shoes for sure. And fall rain. Let's just do fall rain. According to reviews,
[2474.20s -> 2481.26s]  there's more wave shootouts to come in the side missions. That's all right though. Site 32 is
[2481.26s -> 2498.50s]  caved in. All right. We just did this one. What's another good one for the side content? Oil rig is
[2498.50s -> 2513.69s]  locked, but it's really good. Okay. Do crash. Crash site is fun. Destroy the crashed plane's cargo.
[2513.69s -> 2520.17s]  That sounds cool. I'll do it. Our forces downed a Horizon airplane. It was carrying high tech
[2520.17s -> 2526.23s]  weapons to be sold to an African warlord. Find the cargo and make sure it's destroyed. Unfortunately,
[2526.23s -> 2532.94s]  it crashed into a former nuclear testing site in Algeria. The air is heavily irradiated. So watch
[2532.94s -> 2552.60s]  your Geiger counter. Oh, I didn't even mean to do that, but I did for weapons. I think I want,
[2552.60s -> 2569.86s]  I need long range and short range. That's been my problem. That's my issue. What is a good long
[2569.86s -> 2586.54s]  range? Let me just take the rifle. You don't need long range. Just run faster. I'll, I'll take the
[2586.54s -> 2603.88s]  rifle. I think this thing's pretty versatile. Do I want to do anything to it? No suppressor. Laser
[2603.88s -> 2613.30s]  sight, I feel like gives me away too much. All right. All right. Now for the short range. Can
[2613.30s -> 2618.66s]  you do aim down sights in this game? You can not unless it is, you have a scope on it or some type
[2618.66s -> 2633.86s]  of aim down sights thing on the weapon. Pistol. Okay. Somebody said, I fucking hate this dinosaur.
[2633.86s -> 2644.01s]  Why was this? What's this dinosaur? What's this? Dino dance was a dinosaur. You guys don't like the
[2644.01s -> 2651.58s]  Dino dance. I figured you guys would like the Dino dance. This is a dancing community. We have
[2651.58s -> 2660.82s]  six or seven different dancing emotes. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to do shotgun, shotgun
[2660.82s -> 2669.40s]  rifle. In fact, we're going to go, we're going to double shotgun. Even though I don't like this,
[2669.40s -> 2683.59s]  I'm going to do it because I'm trying to make the fans happy. Incendiary unfolded. How do I
[2683.59s -> 2699.43s]  switch to the other weapon? Can I do the other weapon? Oh, that was weird. There we go. All right.
[2699.43s -> 2712.14s]  Now we're good. This thing is going to be destructive. Full ammo. I've got flash bangs,
[2712.14s -> 2720.97s]  armor. Good to go. It has the other attachments on already if you do weld. Ah, okay. That's good to
[2720.97s -> 2727.48s]  know. It didn't look like it though. I had laser on one of the SMGs and it wasn't on the other one.
[2727.48s -> 2756.65s]  This is the hardest level in the game. Okay. This is the hardest level in the game. Hey,
[2756.65s -> 2775.40s]  I'm up for a challenge. Let's go. Somebody talking. What is all this? There is a sniper rifle here.
[2776.04s -> 2780.49s]  All right. I have an idea. I'm just going to, I'm going to come back and pick this weapon up.
[2780.49s -> 2783.99s]  Remind me that it's here because I'm definitely going to do some sniping here like this.
[2784.71s -> 2798.39s]  That was so bad. I have to restart the whole thing. I missed five shots in a row. I have to restart
[2798.39s -> 2804.15s]  the entire mission. Honestly, I should verify, I should verify integrity of game cache on steam.
[2804.15s -> 2827.45s]  Just, I feel like, I feel like I fucking corrupted the game being that bad. Okay. Let's go. I need
[2827.45s -> 2837.70s]  to put a suppressor on this. Suppressor. Okay. Here we go. I should be able to do this pretty
[2837.70s -> 2852.65s]  easily now. Easy. All right. Where else? Where's everybody else? There's a guy over here. Where is
[2852.65s -> 2891.53s]  this guy? The guy is just spinning around with his flashlight. What's this guy doing in here? Hey,
[2891.53s -> 2894.41s]  you tell me this is the hardest mission in the game. I'm going to listen. Okay. I'm doing this
[2894.41s -> 2922.46s]  the way I want to do it. I ain't, I ain't messing around. Ooh, nice. Weapon pot. Homing. Ooh. All
[2922.46s -> 2926.90s]  right. I don't think I need this anymore. I'm going to take this because this is pretty short
[2926.90s -> 2937.24s]  range. So I'm going to stick with this. I also have the double shotguns. I'm being here. I'm
[2937.24s -> 2975.66s]  going to see if I can. Oh my. What happened? Oh my God. What? Yeah. They did.
[3004.87s -> 3017.11s]  Oh, I'm the shotgun guy. I don't know how to. Where's my supplies? Wait, what? That's an enemy
[3017.11s -> 3064.06s]  right there. That's got to be, that would have to have been terrible. Oh, come on. Bring it on.
[3064.06s -> 3105.05s]  Oh, they told me it was hard. Like I exploded. Supplies. Um, I'm going with this thing. Is it
[3105.05s -> 3117.08s]  the same weapon? Is it the same gun? No, it's not. I want this one. This thing's kind of hard to use.
[3128.95s -> 3137.58s]  Two times scope. That's for this gun, isn't it? I'll put, all right, we'll do all this. We'll do.
[3137.58s -> 3155.86s]  Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. Two times scope. Nice. This is another two X scope. All right. Where are
[3155.86s -> 3175.56s]  they? Where is everybody? Ooh, give me that. There's one person just hiding somewhere. It's
[3175.56s -> 3211.98s]  still alive. You in the plane? Where even is this guy? Are you still alive? I don't see anybody.
[3214.18s -> 3221.24s]  Bro, please drink some water. I got, I got it right here. I'm good. I'm hydrating. Don't worry.
[3221.24s -> 3229.91s]  Nobody know where this guy is. He's down. Oh, you made that up. I'm trying to get to the highest
[3229.91s -> 3239.11s]  point. So I get shot at. There is nobody left. Is there, I don't even know which object. Oh, wait.
[3239.75s -> 3246.33s]  Okay. He's over here. What have you been doing?
[3258.87s -> 3286.12s]  Shooting it rocks. What the fuck was that? Get him. Get him. Ooh. Give me that. Look at this. All
[3286.12s -> 3311.58s]  right. I'm ready. I didn't know he was going to do that. And it's got on by a bird. Really?
[3312.06s -> 3322.82s]  I just got bird shit all over me. What the hell? Airstrike means airstrike, dude. I didn't know
[3322.82s -> 3335.94s]  if they were talking about right here. I guess. So what do I do? Dude. What the hell? That almost
[3335.94s -> 3362.25s]  hit me. What the fuck are you talking about? I thought that was a friendly plane because it
[3362.25s -> 3369.70s]  says supplies. Ready? Watch, watch, watch. Ready? Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Enemy activity firing.
[3370.86s -> 3377.61s]  Look that. Oh, that's it. I thought. Okay. Usually. Okay. Usually the ones that are indicated
[3377.61s -> 3406.70s]  with white means that I don't know. Maybe don't come down. I don't want that. No, no, no, no, no,
[3406.70s -> 3472.41s]  no, no, no. I want this. Oh, oh, this thing's out of bullets. See ya.
[3486.20s -> 3571.85s]  Hmm. Ah, shit. I helped. Where is he? There's only one left. Where is he? Yes.
[3576.94s -> 3586.06s]  Snipers. You got it. I need a sniper rifle. Oh, god damn it. Oh, god damn it. Hold on.
[3586.06s -> 3612.07s]  I need a sniper. Where's my sniper rifle? Where'd it go? I need a good spot. Right here. That guy
[3612.07s -> 3656.04s]  dead. Right here. Oh, where is he? The hell is he? Where is this guy? Oh, you're
[3656.04s -> 3663.16s]  right there. I see where you are. What's wrong with my sniper rifle? Why is my sniper
[3663.16s -> 3699.03s]  rifle a go-kart? Oh, that's why. Get out of here. See? It's a white indicator. The enemy
[3699.03s -> 3731.18s]  approaching is yellow. Yellow indicator. Um, good. I'll take the grenades. That doesn't work. I gotta
[3731.18s -> 3749.19s]  get over there quick. Come on. Come on. Hurry, hurry. Hurry. What? What is, what are you talking
[3749.19s -> 3801.80s]  about? You, I can't destroy the helicopter. I did not know that. It's okay. Oh, any more bullets?
[3801.80s -> 3832.62s]  No. You think I care? Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Why would he do that? Why would you
[3832.62s -> 3846.15s]  do that? I didn't, I had no shots in that fucking gun. That was the last enemy too. God damn it.
[3846.15s -> 3857.32s]  What did you just drop? Uh, I just went like this. I just put my hands down on my chair. Okay. This
[3857.32s -> 3863.02s]  time I'm not going to blow it. Cause watch, I can't destroy the helicopter. So I'm going to wait.
[3863.02s -> 3906.33s]  This whole thing is going to be so much cleaner now. Watch this. Okay. Much. What? I died like
[3906.33s -> 3928.63s]  instantly. Oh, somebody sniped me. I got sniped. It's all good. Shoot the rockets out of the air.
[3929.75s -> 3951.59s]  That was pretty cool. Nice. All right. I got to get up high because that would have been great.
[3960.68s -> 3984.55s]  Get on this. What are you doing? That just messed up everything. All right. Much better. We're good.
[3984.55s -> 3994.25s]  I'm almost dead. I don't know what just hurt me, but it was a sniper probably.
[4005.85s -> 4060.50s]  Okay. I'm fine. Oh shit. Oh shit. I was, oh shit. Oh, he's still alive. Is he? That guy.
[4061.91s -> 4081.99s]  I, that, that was pretty good. That's pretty good. I knocked that guy into next week. Nice.
[4084.31s -> 4095.94s]  Get him. I need a weapon. Just run around and get everything.
[4098.98s -> 4103.94s]  Primary objective incoming. He's going to land and I'm going to throw a grenade right in his face.
[4103.94s -> 4137.27s]  There's no more weapons. I can't get anything. Pick up a different gun. Pick it up. Pick the,
[4137.27s -> 4147.64s]  I need a gun. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[4147.64s -> 4166.14s]  This guy's fucking relentless. I, I don't even know who's firing at me.
[4166.70s -> 4207.21s]  He'll run out of bullets eventually. Dude. I can't, dude. There's too many fucking people.
[4207.21s -> 4231.37s]  There's too many people. Die. Die. Oh my. I got one of those. I got one of those guns. I got one
[4231.37s -> 4269.46s]  of those guns. I have one of those crazy guns. Oh, this guy's got so many grenades. Okay. Here
[4269.46s -> 4284.41s]  we go. Moment of truth. Moment of truth. I think I'm okay. I think I'm okay. Ah, yes. All right.
[4284.41s -> 4289.67s]  I'm good. I'm good. There's only like two more people. We're going to be very safe about this.
[4295.21s -> 4307.34s]  Where are you? You're over here. There you are. One more. Ah, thank God. It's not it. What do you
[4307.34s -> 4349.72s]  mean it's not it? Fuck what I just did. Nice. That was crazy. That was a wacky one. All right.
[4349.72s -> 4358.95s]  We're good. Very good. Very cool. I cannot imagine playing some of these on a harder difficulty.
[4362.14s -> 4369.32s]  I think hard is my limit. Very hard might actually be doable, but some of the two above very hard
[4369.32s -> 4388.71s]  it seems almost impossible. All right. I wonder if I've unlocked any cheats.
[4408.07s -> 4416.14s]  Uh, somebody I'm playing on hard. Let me see. Ah, okay. Unlock some squeaky voices. We're
[4416.14s -> 4431.94s]  turning that on. Uh, no, we're not. Spooky mode. No checkpoints. Well, I want to be able to unlock
[4431.94s -> 4438.95s]  stuff on hard. So when I'm done unlocking stuff, we'll turn a bunch of random shit on because if
[4438.95s -> 4443.75s]  I turn one of those on, regardless if it's just a goofy one, it means every difficulty is easy
[4445.16s -> 4451.05s]  or it's it. I can't get achievements for playing on hard and I still have to beat the game.
[4451.91s -> 4455.11s]  All right. What else we got? I'm going to let's all right. Let's beat the game.
[4455.11s -> 4461.48s]  I'm going to unlock everything so then I can just play the side stuff with cheats. Do you
[4461.48s -> 4468.15s]  really care about achievements? Well, I care about unlocking things and I think you have to play
[4468.15s -> 4483.58s]  missions on normal or hard to unlock things. All right, let's do it. Lead an assault on
[4483.58s -> 4492.94s]  Horizon HQ. Destroy Horizon once and for all. We've finally done it. We destroyed Horizon's
[4492.94s -> 4498.14s]  unethical research projects. We expose their dark secrets to the world. Their stocks are crumbling.
[4498.14s -> 4503.66s]  Employees are quitting en masse. The company lies in ruins. The CEO and executives are hiding
[4503.66s -> 4508.30s]  in Horizon's corporate headquarters. Eliminate them and destroy Horizon once and for all.
[4516.07s -> 4523.74s]  My accolades. All right, let me get different weapons because this is a normal mission. So I
[4523.74s -> 4542.14s]  want some different stuff. All right. Flashbangs are useful because you have five armor, obviously.
[4542.14s -> 4557.94s]  I'm going single SMG and it's going to be unfolded, unfolded stock. It's no suppressor.
[4557.94s -> 4572.28s]  And then I'm going to do honestly grenade launcher because it's just, I need some
[4572.28s -> 4581.38s]  destruction power. Should I even do homing? Lower velocity grenades with a longer fuse that home
[4581.38s -> 4593.11s]  onto enemies. Meh, I don't think so. What kind of games do you like? I like games where you have
[4593.11s -> 4604.55s]  upgrades. I love games that have interesting loot. I like casual games that you can play in bed.
[4604.55s -> 4619.62s]  Those are fun. I like upgrading. Oh, you know what I got to play? Uh, there's a new game.
[4620.74s -> 4627.24s]  Torment. What's it called? It's kind of like Vampire Survivors. It's new and it looks great.
[4627.24s -> 4634.57s]  Falls of Torment. Yeah, that's fun. I got to play that. That looks really, really,
[4634.57s -> 4653.30s]  that looks pretty damn good. Is it good? Can you please jump into the helicopter blades? I tried
[4653.30s -> 4657.58s]  already and it didn't work. So I'm sorry that I cannot do that. All right, here we go. Final
[4657.58s -> 4667.83s]  mission of the game. Let's do it. I think I'm good. I think I have a pretty good arsenal.
[4667.83s -> 4675.00s]  Was that poker game you played on iPad? That would be pine tar poker. It's very good.
[4675.00s -> 4684.12s]  Pine tar poker, pine tar poker. They keep cutting me off. Pine tar poker on the app store. It's a
[4684.12s -> 4692.47s]  fun game. It's a combination of Yahtzee and also poker. It's a very, very fun game to play. You've
[4692.47s -> 4698.07s]  got maybe an airplane trip you're going to go on. It's a good thing to kill some time.
[4698.07s -> 4702.31s]  If you want to just relax and, you know, take, you want to get like a little bit of a wind down
[4702.31s -> 4716.38s]  scenario in your, you know, in bed. All right, let's go. Let's go get them. It's time to use
[4716.38s -> 4779.19s]  everything I've learned. Do we swap or is it time to do a weld? How do I open the door? Am I missing
[4779.19s -> 4835.50s]  something? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Holy shit. You're all so dead. All right. The other door is going
[4835.50s -> 4851.48s]  to open now, right? I don't know. Open up everything. Take everything. Blow this up.
[4851.48s -> 4875.00s]  Other side for sure. I wasn't even looking in the right direction. I got 10 bullets for this. Oh,
[4875.00s -> 4885.58s]  yeah. This thing was a great pick. Good. Very good choice here. Yeah. I want the actual grenades.
[4885.58s -> 4906.06s]  He's patting himself on the back. Yep. It's a good call. I made a good call. I'm not allowed
[4906.06s -> 4928.02s]  to say that was a good call. All right. Somebody could be right here. No. All right. We're good.
[4928.02s -> 4939.16s]  We want to go to the bridge. You think I would wait till I got out of the elevator before pressing
[4939.16s -> 4976.18s]  the button? All right. Let's go. Yikes. What was that? All right. Oh, my God. We'll be still
[4976.18s -> 4990.57s]  alive back there. Whatever. All right. Do I have to get in the building? What's that? Remind me
[4990.57s -> 4998.95s]  that this is here because they definitely want me to do this for some reason. Smart gun. Bullets
[4998.95s -> 5063.50s]  home on two enemies. Yeah. Oh, OK. Dude, dude, these bullets. Smart. Not that smart. You have
[5063.50s -> 5086.71s]  to aim. Stand back. Stand back. Stand back. Stand back. Stand. How about these fucking smart
[5086.71s -> 5123.78s]  bullets? Who's left? You? I got him. All right. Let's I got to do some inventory. Where is this
[5123.78s -> 5175.99s]  guy? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I need to. Give me that. Give me that. Give me that. Give me that.
[5175.99s -> 5192.57s]  Give me this. Give me this. Fucking ammo in this gun. I'm sorry. I can't fucking do anything.
[5192.65s -> 5204.58s]  I can't reload the gun. All right. Come on. No more fucking around. Give me my smart gun.
[5211.94s -> 5270.36s]  It's overstimulated. All right. These are smart. What the guy was aiming at the ground. Oh, shit.
[5270.36s -> 5296.06s]  Are you all right? I'm going in. I'm going in. I'm going in. Oh, I give me some help up here.
[5308.79s -> 5360.34s]  I don't know. Do you like it? What the fuck am I doing here? I need to go. Stop being an idiot.
[5360.34s -> 5372.58s]  No. Get off of there. Get out of my way. Dude, I got no guns left. I have no ammo left. You guys
[5372.58s -> 5394.81s]  have to help me. You guys have to do a lot of work here. I have no bullets. Oh, my God. Please.
[5395.45s -> 5398.49s]  Give me his gun. He had a gun. He had a gun. He has a gun. He has a gun. Give me that. No,
[5398.49s -> 5442.46s]  give me the gun. Give me. Give me. That guy didn't even exist. That guy didn't exist. Oh,
[5442.46s -> 5459.26s]  my God. Your fucking oxygen tank is just such a pain in the ass. Okay. Move up. Move up. Move up.
[5459.58s -> 5522.68s]  You guys getting? I got it. That was crazy. That's not it. Oh, my God. Wow. That was awesome.
[5522.68s -> 5532.60s]  That was hoggers. I'll keep the shotguns. Let me make sure I have ammo, though.
[5533.16s -> 5545.59s]  Horizon factory explosion, chain explosion. It's just kind of a new story.
[5546.31s -> 5560.17s]  Everybody all right? Pick up all the intel. I hereby tender by resignation from Horizon
[5560.17s -> 5564.57s]  effective immediately. I am deeply troubled by the recent revelation of the company's
[5564.57s -> 5577.86s]  immoral activities. Okay. You know what video games do a lot and movies do this too?
[5580.33s -> 5586.41s]  The trope of the CEO has a message that's just being played on giant speakers throughout the
[5586.41s -> 5595.83s]  entire building. There's like a CEO monologue that plays where is this an I don't think that's that
[5595.83s -> 5602.55s]  normal of an occurrence to have the CEO be just like talking through giant PA system all day at
[5602.55s -> 5662.14s]  work. You do this at work. Oh, I created you. Am I the bad guy? I'm sorry. I didn't really hear
[5662.14s -> 5665.82s]  much of what you said. I was thinking of a really cool way. I was going to kill you.
[5665.82s -> 5688.76s]  Oh, we need to all just got to chill for a sec.
[5689.32s -> 5713.05s]  Attention all personnel. Evacuate now. That's still got you, buddy.
[5727.86s -> 5738.95s]  I don't know. No, no, no, no, no, no. How is he dead? All right. This is going to get intense
[5738.95s -> 5748.20s]  right now. Or you take off. Just give me 30 minutes. I may be able to install something
[5748.20s -> 5757.99s]  to help with the upload process. They're uploading the virus to the cloud. Almost got me.
[5758.63s -> 5783.14s]  Oh, my arm. How is that? I want to know how it's possible that I just missed all those.
[5783.78s -> 5806.98s]  How is that possible? That is impossible. More Intel. There's a lot of Intel here.
[5806.98s -> 5813.27s]  Our employee satisfaction survey just leaked. It was all one star reviews. We need to find a way
[5813.27s -> 5816.31s]  to cover this up as soon as possible. Maybe a few incentives will change people's minds.
[5816.95s -> 5866.28s]  One star. Here we go. I got running. They'll never see us through the blinds.
[5899.94s -> 5946.20s]  That guy's head did a full 360. We're good. Oh, he's he has a lawnmower gun. All right.
[5946.20s -> 5964.07s]  He has a lawnmower gun. I want a smart gun, but I want all right. There we go.
[5964.07s -> 5986.57s]  And I only have one of these. I can only hold one. I can't do a well. The smart gun. That's too bad.
[5986.57s -> 5994.34s]  That would have been so funny. You're reading this. You are among the few who chose to remain
[5994.34s -> 5999.98s]  and make a stand. I applaud your bravery. I am moved by your passion and belief in the company's
[5999.98s -> 6007.19s]  values. Most of us will not live to see tomorrow, but the people of the future will thank us for
[6007.19s -> 6011.99s]  the stand we make today. They may not know your names or your actions, but what we do here today
[6011.99s -> 6019.03s]  will leave a mark in humanity's history. We cannot win today, but I still have one trick left up my
[6019.03s -> 6026.94s]  sleeve. My last request. Buy me some time. Your children will live in a better world for it.
[6027.26s -> 6033.98s]  I'm gonna smart gun this guy. All right. Should I not even give this guy a second to talk?
[6033.98s -> 6038.79s]  I'm thinking about just revving up the lawnmower, opening the door into slow motioning.
[6038.79s -> 6057.35s]  Hi. He's just dead. Oh, no. He did. He did the joke. He did the joke.
[6060.81s -> 6075.61s]  Oh, no. It was the Puzzler. It's your lucky quarter. This looks like a FPS map.
[6080.95s -> 6085.83s]  Okay. I didn't even know what we were doing. That was okay. That was like a first person shooter
[6085.83s -> 6121.18s]  map. I didn't know we were changing maps. This thing is too hot. It's too hot. It's too hot.
[6121.18s -> 6170.70s]  It's too hot. Get this thing ready. I don't know who's up there, but I'm gonna make a funny joke
[6170.70s -> 6175.59s]  and you'll know when it's about time for you to die. Here we go. Playing Mario Kart.
[6182.76s -> 6193.64s]  All right. Where the fuck are you? He's so silly. Oh, that was so silly. What I just did.
[6193.64s -> 6219.29s]  I need ammo. What's this? Oh, boy. Okay. Well, this is the final battle, I think, coming up.
[6219.29s -> 6232.02s]  How do I want to be in the final battle? I feel like this thing is gonna- I'm gonna get rid of
[6232.02s -> 6247.66s]  this very quickly. I'm not sure it's shotguns, honestly. I think I want a sniper rifle,
[6247.66s -> 6258.65s]  as weird as that sounds. This might be really stupid, but I'm gonna go sniper rifle and smart
[6258.65s -> 6279.42s]  gun. I'm gonna go in headshots only. Smart bullets work aim down sights. I don't think
[6279.42s -> 6289.05s]  there is an aim down sights unless I have to put it on. I'm gonna try it. Here's the last piece of
[6289.05s -> 6296.95s]  intel. Calling any personnel who meet or exceed the following requirements. Cranial capacity over
[6296.95s -> 6311.10s]  1,800. Master's degree or higher. You're needed for an emergency project immediately. I gotta
[6311.10s -> 6452.54s]  pee real bad. Give me one sec. For the final battle. I have returned. I'm ready for the final
[6452.54s -> 6469.54s]  battle. Okay. I'll try sniper. Yeah, you gotta get the pee out of your system before you do
[6469.54s -> 6490.06s]  something like this. You married into it. It is hot out. Sorry. It is hot out. It's on way more
[6490.06s -> 6501.69s]  Chad. It's hot and dry out here. All right. Give me some, give me a little bit of slack.
[6501.69s -> 6510.06s]  It's very dry and it's very hot out here. I'm ready. All right. How do I, where's the,
[6510.06s -> 6531.78s]  let's go. Dry or humid heat worse? Humid heat is the worst thing on earth. I will take dry heat
[6531.78s -> 6539.42s]  over humid heat every single day of the week. Every day of the week. In a dry heat, you do not
[6539.42s -> 6545.67s]  really sweat, which is actually kind of more dangerous in a way because you don't, you don't
[6545.67s -> 6552.49s]  realize like, oh, I'm not sweating. It's so dry. Everything's fine. But it's like 110 degrees out
[6552.49s -> 6560.49s]  and dry. You gotta be sure you're hydrating. Oh, we gotta go this way. All right. I got full
[6560.49s -> 6565.11s]  grenades. I got full smart gun. I'm ready. This is it. Let's kick the door in and I'm ready.
[6565.11s -> 6594.25s]  Cutscene. Ooh. Wait, what? Wait, what? He's just lying down naked in a chamber.
[6594.89s -> 6612.71s]  That was never, that was never going to work. Brain upload in progress. Wait,
[6612.71s -> 6637.94s]  that guy just sprayed me in the face like a bottle. Well, water bottle. What? Oh, I don't know.
[6638.66s -> 6659.86s]  Where's the brain? Where's the brain upload? Oh, can you do crazy frog? What's going on?
[6659.94s -> 6675.67s]  Yeah. God damn it. You've leaned. You've leaned. Like I leaned.
[6707.56s -> 6715.72s]  I just picked up every single fucking health pack. I'm in so much trouble. I'm in so much trouble.
[6716.54s -> 6751.26s]  Smart gun out. Did you hear that? I slid by that wall. It was just I picked up every health pack.
[6751.26s -> 6754.70s]  I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot what was going on.
[6755.18s -> 6789.94s]  I forgot. All right. This is the one right here. Let's go. That took a lot from the smart gun.
[6789.94s -> 6795.14s]  Damn it, man. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I got to take the smart gun out there
[6795.14s -> 6903.22s]  and just spray. Where are they? Where are they? Get it. Oh, pick it up. Why would I have two sniper
[6903.22s -> 6911.22s]  rifles? This is not good at all. Where's the brain? Where's the brain? Holy shit. This is hard.
[6911.22s -> 6960.86s]  This is hard. Did I get it? I didn't even. Dude, I die in three fucking hits. Okay.
[6998.65s -> 7006.65s]  Dude, I just threw two grenades at it. Do I have to shoot it through the window?
[7006.65s -> 7009.85s]  I have to shoot the glass. I can't load up with that. It didn't hit the glass.
[7012.55s -> 7050.41s]  How does a grenade not hit the glass? Okay. Go back over there. All right. Go, go, go. It's
[7050.41s -> 7077.08s]  on the other side. Other side. I'm not dead. Oh, where is it? Where are you? What the fuck are
[7077.08s -> 7086.81s]  you doing over there? Oh my goodness, dude. You got to be fucking kidding me.
[7094.28s -> 7102.01s]  God, what is happening? Wait, I didn't even reload this gun yet. Who's talking? Who is it? The
[7102.01s -> 7160.09s]  dentist. No. No. Yeah. I need a gun right now. Dude, what do I do? No. I'm so glad I'm bad. I'm
[7160.09s -> 7175.93s]  so glad I'm bad. I'm so glad I'm bad at this game. I'm so glad I'm bad at this. Oh, fuck. It's just
[7175.93s -> 7183.29s]  so much going on. There's just too many things happening at the same time. Do I have to do it
[7183.29s -> 7209.96s]  all over again? Oh, this sucks. Dude, I don't know. Just take it. Take it. Go, go, go, go. I don't
[7209.96s -> 7240.90s]  know. That's it. That's it. Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. Go, go, go. That's it. That's it. Where is
[7240.90s -> 7257.16s]  this? There's still an upload going on. Where's this last upload? What the fuck are you talking
[7257.16s -> 7271.74s]  about? What? Dude, where is this last part? I need a different gun. Like, give me ammo for the ships.
[7271.74s -> 7306.86s]  Give me ammo for a different weapon. This is too much stimulation. This is like overload. This is
[7306.86s -> 7323.64s]  just like, I feel like I'm playing the game at times 10 speed. Am I hitting anybody over here?
[7332.65s -> 7338.73s]  I don't know where anybody is. There's no way to tell. I don't know, dude. They just keep respawning.
[7338.89s -> 7347.83s]  You have to aim a dude. Okay, here's what's going on right now.
[7353.05s -> 7356.34s]  That's the only sound effect. I can't.
[7376.41s -> 7401.78s]  Fuck you. Dude, I keep here. I keep getting put back to the dentist. Oh, and everybody has grenades.
[7402.58s -> 7416.68s]  Oh my. I can't like brain upload. All right, now what the fuck do I do?
[7417.24s -> 7424.28s]  You idiot. Why would you walk over to me? Why would you walk over here? You idiot. You dumb guy.
[7424.28s -> 7438.33s]  What's wrong with you? Okay. I get rid of this thing. This thing does like too damage. This weapon
[7438.33s -> 7460.63s]  is awful. I don't even, I don't want to snipe a rifle either. I picked the two worst possible
[7460.63s -> 7484.78s]  weapons for this fucking mission. This grenades everywhere. They just crashed the helicopter.
[7484.78s -> 7489.66s]  Crash the helicopter. They just crashed the helicopter. There's too much going on.
[7489.66s -> 7502.04s]  I have to restart the level and pick different weapons. I have no ammo all of a sudden. Give
[7502.04s -> 7529.78s]  me that. All right. Now fuck you. Perfect. How are you guys still alive? Shut up.
[7550.78s -> 7554.55s]  Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[7557.46s -> 7576.42s]  All right. Now what? Smart gun, actual smart gun. I can't get in there.
[7592.65s -> 7611.83s]  Okay. Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me. There's no way. There's no way.
[7622.65s -> 7638.94s]  Shoot him. There's too many people. There's too many people there. I needed that. I needed it.
[7659.30s -> 7686.84s]  Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. You better not kill me. Oh no. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[7686.84s -> 7693.08s]  There was like a hundred people there. There was a hundred. Why were there so many people there?
[7693.08s -> 7704.39s]  Why were there so many people? Oh my God. Oh, thank God. There's a checkpoint.
[7705.19s -> 7806.68s]  Give me that. Get out of here. Let me in. Let's do it. Yes.
[7824.98s -> 7877.18s]  All right. I need some. All right. Give me your gun. Where is it? Okay. Fuck it. Let's go.
[7877.18s -> 7886.76s]  I'm ready. No, I'm not. I want help. This game doesn't look very Christian.
[7888.82s -> 7896.86s]  Oh yeah. Probably not. I don't know. All right. I have, I want a different weapon than this.
[7897.42s -> 7901.66s]  We'll go with this because I think I'm going to get spawned on. I'm going full firepower
[7904.06s -> 7908.28s]  and I have to take cover. Where am I going to take cover? It's probably a good idea to
[7908.28s -> 7934.15s]  go in the building and hide here. Let's do it. Get the fuck out of here. Get out of here.
[7934.15s -> 7996.84s]  Is it me? That's me. That's me. Wait, what? What did I do? I like teleported. Was I him?
[7997.48s -> 8013.16s]  Did I like, my consciousness jumped? How did I get through the wall? Break the cycle. How did I
[8013.16s -> 8024.87s]  get in the, how did I get in? There was some weird stuff going on early in the game. You know,
[8024.87s -> 8030.73s]  those drones, they're like, Hey, don't trust people. And you're, it's not, everything's not
[8030.73s -> 8061.10s]  what it seems. And now the room filled with gas. Liquidation process initiative. I'm getting
[8061.10s -> 8113.69s]  liquidated. It's been cool to have one of those. That seemed like an awesome weapon. I'm everybody.
[8113.69s -> 8141.37s]  It's a different 106 every time. I'm everybody. No, it isn't. Not if I have anything to say about
[8141.37s -> 8171.77s]  it. Why would you pick a gun out? Why would you take a gun out? That's up and point it close
[8171.77s -> 8179.91s]  to my face. I was about to be burned. Oh, that guy. Hey, they're going to write a whole
[8179.91s -> 8183.67s]  entire history book about how you fucked up right there. There's going to be
[8184.23s -> 8200.18s]  textbooks written about what you did. What's the Intel terminate rogue assets. This is what I am
[8202.39s -> 8254.70s]  armor and speed improvements recommended for next cycle. Give me that. Oh, okay. Yep. I'll stand
[8254.70s -> 8260.70s]  out. What would you want me to go back and lie on the, on the burn table thing? I can do that.
[8261.94s -> 8271.50s]  Yeah. Where was it? It was back here, right? Stand. Yeah. Here we go. Okay. I'm ready. I'm really
[8271.50s -> 8301.86s]  sorry. You can press, you can press the button. I won't do anything else. Ooh. Oh, watch out for
[8301.86s -> 8335.46s]  enemies. We were friends quarter master. Really is not. It sucks to be that guy. The guy that opened
[8335.46s -> 8378.70s]  the door. Yeah. I mean, come on. Oh my God. I'm so bad. Any health. There we go. There's a nice spam.
[8378.70s -> 8402.50s]  Hey, you do what you got to do. All right. Nobody else. Okay. Uh, I don't, there's nothing really on
[8402.50s -> 8412.84s]  the ground. Have I not picked up any shotgun ammo? It seems impossible. Okay. Where's the
[8412.84s -> 8437.86s]  off switch for this? What do you mean? Dude, dude, what, what? Shoot the red. I have to pull one of
[8437.86s -> 8448.60s]  those fuse boxes. What do you mean? Shoot the red. Dude, I'm sorry. I've never had to do that the
[8448.60s -> 8469.06s]  whole game. I have not had to do that the whole game. I've been looking for a fuse box, dude.
[8471.16s -> 8508.79s]  Let's go. I didn't kill either one of them. You know what? I got a better idea. Oh, it didn't
[8508.79s -> 8536.89s]  kill you. All right. It's all right. Okay. Good. Oh my God. Oh, are we okay? Am I alive?
[8538.94s -> 8565.80s]  I have one shot. All right. I, I got to get ready. Shut down. I think I'm good with this for now.
[8565.88s -> 8616.52s]  Send here. And, uh, yeah, here we go. Super soldiers or something. Oh, that's literally me.
[8616.52s -> 8628.92s]  We're all. Oh, all right. What the, that's actually scared the shit out of me. That was right.
[8628.92s -> 8656.89s]  That's behind my head. Oh my God. I hate that. What am I doing? I didn't mean to press that
[8656.89s -> 8672.10s]  button. My fat fingered it. Okay. I'm thinking shotgun. Okay. I can see you cause you're on fire.
[8672.10s -> 8706.86s]  This is perfect. Damn it. All right. All right. Spy checking. Yeah. How did I miss?
[8706.86s -> 8751.48s]  What are you doing? Where'd he go? Don't walk over here with that on your body.
[8754.28s -> 8803.83s]  This place is like gonna blow. Oh, it's so dead. Anybody else? Where is he?
[8805.80s -> 8840.98s]  I'm so sorry guys. I've just fucking, it's terrifying. Where's he going? What? What? Turn
[8840.98s -> 8879.66s]  it off. Oh shit. Yup. Wow. Um, okay. I have one arm. Go, go, go, go, go. What is that sound?
[8899.66s -> 8931.70s]  Oh my God. Oh my God. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Uh, oh, a drone. Location. Syndicate
[8931.70s -> 8942.70s]  cloning facility. Accessing user memories. Successful. Package. Syndicate cloning activity.
[8942.70s -> 8955.27s]  Upload complete. Accessing attempt. Accessing network. Subject 105 termination. Verified.
[8955.27s -> 8961.80s]  Pandora Institute. Evidence of anomalous research. Incomplete. Mission to terminate subject 91.
[8961.80s -> 8970.73s]  Incomplete. Syndicate thermonuclear warhead. Cyperia. Tower massacre. Incomplete. Syndicate
[8970.73s -> 8976.09s]  cloning activity. Mission critical data. Incomplete. You'll be remembered. There's
[8976.09s -> 8982.42s]  no extraction. Destroy the facility. You'll be remembered. These are the drones that you missed.
[8984.66s -> 9006.57s]  Bad ending. Okay. Exiting program. Well, how does it end? I feel like this is not a lot of bullets
[9006.57s -> 9021.46s]  for what is about to happen here. I could be wrong, but let's just go. Uh, this is the way
[9021.46s -> 9047.11s]  I came in. Okay. Let's go. Oh, that's the nuke. I remember. I tried to blow this thing up. All
[9047.11s -> 9070.23s]  right. Don't let them get near the nuke. You think you can block that? What if I go invisible?
[9070.23s -> 9119.70s]  I need a gun. Shotgun. I need a shotgun. There's the shotgun right there. Give me that. Give me
[9119.70s -> 9129.24s]  your gun. Give me that. Give me that. Oh, fuck you. Oh, I have nothing. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I...
[9130.28s -> 9151.54s]  Where did they all come from? Dude, I... Oh my... Why do I have a pistol? This pistol... Can I just
[9151.54s -> 9164.33s]  throw this in the trash? All right. Let's go. Why did I pick up a pistol for any reason?
[9177.69s -> 9194.57s]  Where is he? I'm just trying to... Oh, I'm going to get hurt too. I'm getting too hurt.
[9194.57s -> 9230.90s]  Way too hurt. What's going on? What's happening? What's going on? Did you hear that? That's way
[9230.90s -> 9279.61s]  too many people. Stop throwing grenades. All right. I think I'm good. Only one more. Let's go. Let's
[9279.61s -> 9310.20s]  go. Let's go. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. Where is he? I'm getting too greedy.
[9310.20s -> 9342.42s]  Too greedy. Don't be stupid. Don't be greedy. Goodbye. Yes. Those of you playing harder than
[9342.42s -> 9368.92s]  hard, you're a god. You are a god. I think we just blow it up, right? I played this on very hard.
[9368.92s -> 9383.26s]  I have no idea how I'd go harder than that. Oh, we just nuked the base. Oh, that's the intro.
[9383.26s -> 9401.24s]  I was wondering why they kept showing that. That's you nuking the base. I get it. Hey,
[9401.24s -> 9427.96s]  Gianni, do you not have to nuke yourself for the good ending? That's a good question. I'm not sure.
[9428.04s -> 9440.57s]  Filing data. Publishing 3968 sources done. Reconstruction unavailable. Memories incomplete.
[9440.57s -> 9454.20s]  Signing off. We uploaded it. Okay. Mission accomplished 106. Hope you enjoyed playing
[9454.20s -> 9460.52s]  the Trepang 2 campaign. You've just unlocked a ton of cool new camos, cheats, and combat simulator
[9460.52s -> 9465.83s]  missions. Go check them out sometime. Come join the community and hang out with us sometime. We
[9465.83s -> 9476.01s]  love to talk with our fans. That was great. That was genuinely really, really, really wonderful.
[9481.03s -> 9487.83s]  Okay. There's a lot of stuff here now. What do we want to do? Enemies activate physics thrusters
[9487.83s -> 9496.25s]  on death? Insane gore. Let's do a couple at a time here. We're going to do squeaky voices.
[9496.89s -> 9507.46s]  Wait, hold on. Let me just see what is actually unlocked here. Show the sunflowers. I will do
[9507.46s -> 9520.39s]  that when I am done with Trepang 2. So soon. Not immediately, but soon. Anything else unlock?
[9520.39s -> 9543.53s]  I only have one other mission here. The Gunnarsson complex is fun. Look at it just in the outskirts
[9543.53s -> 9547.85s]  of Stockholm. The Gunnarsson complex is the center of Horizon's intelligence gathering in Europe.
[9547.85s -> 9563.56s]  Solve the facility and retrieve the encrypted data. That's right. I don't really care about
[9563.56s -> 9571.72s]  the achievements now. Let's do squeaky voices. NPCs throw a lot of grenades.
[9577.02s -> 9590.42s]  NPCs respond as jiggly boys when killed. Okay. Scale enemy accuracy. What does that mean? Scale
[9590.42s -> 9601.69s]  NPC reaction speed. Move speed multiplier. Cloak removed. Focus removed. Slide does not do anything.
[9602.81s -> 9611.61s]  Your health constantly drains until 1%. Spooky mode. Infinite ammo. For a second I thought
[9611.61s -> 9618.47s]  they said can't read. I was like does that mean you can't look at intelligence? Everything is
[9618.47s -> 9628.86s]  a knife. All weapons become inaccurate. Okay. There's a lot on right now. So we're going to
[9628.86s -> 9642.57s]  do these. NPC thrusters. Okay. Why is it all so dark? Oh because it's spooky mode. That just
[9642.57s -> 9668.18s]  means the game is dark. What do I want to bring? Blue double SMG. That sounds fun to me. And
[9669.30s -> 9681.26s]  grenade launcher. Sounds good. Don't need homing on it. These are just default. He's fine. All
[9681.26s -> 9689.62s]  right. Let's go check it out. All right. Spooky mode. Spooky mode just makes this really hard
[9689.62s -> 9713.35s]  to navigate. Where's the stairs? Okay. Let's go. How come the voices aren't squeaky? There's no
[9713.35s -> 9740.36s]  squeaky voices. What have we been waiting for? Probably just the enemies here. This was in the
[9740.36s -> 9750.74s]  demo. This was in the demo. Spooky mode have turned it off. Oh shit. That's not going to help us.
[9751.70s -> 9776.07s]  Okay. Yeah. So I, this is cool. I just can't really see very well. Let's go for it. Who has
[9776.07s -> 9798.62s]  the squeaky voice? Oh, oh my, that hurts my ears. That hurts my ears. I can't see anybody. What is
[9798.70s -> 9854.62s]  that? He's still alive. It's the minions. What? Jesus. All right. I'll take a more proximity
[9854.62s -> 9887.88s]  mines. Oh my God. What is wrong with this guy? Okay. Can I have the light back now? There we go.
[9887.88s -> 9957.02s]  Okay. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Hey, hey, holy shit. Everything. Get out of the way, dude. Get out
[9957.02s -> 9966.95s]  of the way. It's too much. It's too much going on. I'll try it one more time. I'm going to try to
[9966.95s -> 10029.13s]  win. I don't have any ammo. Almost done. I mean, it's kind of funny. It's kind of funny. It's kind
[10029.21s -> 10064.36s]  of funny. All right. Where's the next one? Okay. Pack it. This one's done. Pack it.
[10103.93s -> 10124.62s]  What just happened over here? Who's smoking? All right. More and more of those. All right.
[10124.62s -> 10208.87s]  Hack. Oh, we good. Oh, holy shit. All right. I got to turn this on. I turn this on. Turn this
[10208.87s -> 10215.11s]  on. It's funny. It's fun, but I got to, I don't know what I just did. Is this like one of those
[10215.11s -> 10233.06s]  flash games? What do you mean flash game? What do you mean it's a flash game? I'm going to try
[10233.06s -> 10241.08s]  this one for real, and then we're going to move on to the sunflowers. Restart level. I'm going to
[10241.08s -> 10310.01s]  try this one for real. All right. Let's try it for real. Oh, wait. Somebody's hacking it. Hack it
[10310.01s -> 10340.10s]  again. Hacking. Need to fill the dead air. Um, got him. Somebody up top two. Watch out. Yep. Right
[10340.10s -> 10360.63s]  here. Got one. Specialists. It's another one of those words. Specialists. Specialists.
[10361.27s -> 10412.58s]  Specialists. I did not even get hurt by that. All right. Whoa. Where are you? Woo. Where are you?
[10412.58s -> 10476.92s]  One more. One more guy. Get off of me. All right. Load it up. Good shot. Good shot. Huh?
[10496.07s -> 10541.98s]  Cool. No, you did not get me. Dead air. Um, uh, dead air. It don't matter. I'm just playing.
[10541.98s -> 10565.66s]  I, it's all good. That was so not cool. What I just did. All right. Where's the last one?
[10568.34s -> 10587.05s]  I need supplies actually. Where's the box? Here it is. Okay. Give me. What do I want?
[10587.69s -> 10598.50s]  All right. What do I want? Should I get another grenade launcher? Give me the bolt launcher.
[10601.93s -> 10609.78s]  I'm okay for now. Okay. I think this is all right now. This thing is destructive.
[10629.22s -> 10678.18s]  Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh, ouch. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm out of ammo. Oh, this is not good.
[10678.18s -> 10713.18s]  Get in there. Don't you dare kill me. I don't know for health kit. I can, I can do armor. Okay. Okay.
[10713.18s -> 10746.94s]  Who's left? All right. Through the window. Oh shit. I didn't even start them. Oh,
[10746.94s -> 10782.63s]  that's embarrassing, but whatever. I'm going to get flash bangs. Okay, boys. All right, boys.
[10797.56s -> 10843.43s]  Oh, oh, fuck you. All of you. I'm in big shit. Oh, no way, dude. No way. No way. Oh, that's rough.
[10843.43s -> 10864.81s]  That was the end right there. It's all right. Oh, dude. No way, dude. Open the door. Why would,
[10865.88s -> 10896.55s]  what were you thinking? All right. All right. He's hitting gamer fatigue.
[10896.95s -> 10950.58s]  Ah, maybe a little. Oh, the guy's head just went in so many different directions.
[10950.58s -> 10972.54s]  That was fucking crazy. Oh shit. I got nothing left. I got nothing left. I got nothing left.
[10977.42s -> 11010.95s]  Oh, fuck this guy. Oh, that guy sucks. I need a different weapon. Oh shit.
[11010.95s -> 11044.34s]  I can't. I'm too stimulated. Get over here. Don't. Oh my God. Damn it. I need, I need two
[11044.34s -> 11085.08s]  seconds to fucking reload. Give me more ammo for this thing. You can't be still alive. It's
[11085.08s -> 11158.22s]  impossible. You exploded. I don't have any. Who's left? Oh, fuck that guy. Seriously. Oh,
[11158.22s -> 11202.04s]  fuck off. There's too many of you idiots with these fucking power armor. Oh, eat shit. Oh my
[11202.04s -> 11222.02s]  God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I need more weapons. I can't
[11222.02s -> 11227.90s]  just go down there right now. I need to go to the supply thing. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[11228.46s -> 11281.61s]  Where's the supply thing? Hey. Hey. No. Oh, pick it up with H. You idiot. H. H. I can't even.
[11281.61s -> 11312.52s]  There's too much shit on the ground. Oh, you piece of shit. Oh, I did it. I actually did it.
[11312.52s -> 11348.58s]  Yeah. Okay. I'm ready. How do I get on the roof? How do I get on the roof? How do I get on the
[11348.58s -> 11386.52s]  fucking roof? How do I get on the roof? Damn. All right. I did that on hard. There it is.
[11387.16s -> 11411.67s]  Did I unlock? I unlocked a new cheat. Well, we have to do that. I need to see big head.
[11411.67s -> 11415.53s]  I just want to see the big head and then we'll take a quick break and then we'll look at the
[11415.53s -> 11441.38s]  sunflowers. Yeah. I don't need to do any outfitting or anything. Here's the oil rig. Everyone said,
[11441.38s -> 11451.50s]  hey, do the oil rig when it's available. This is the last side mission. I don't think I'm going to
[11451.50s -> 11469.62s]  beat this one. I think I'll just check it out. I mean, I'm already in here, but as well. Actually,
[11469.62s -> 11503.64s]  no, let's do actual grenade grenades. I am all right with this. Tell us that there was some
[11503.64s -> 11517.24s]  freaky shit at that oil rig, but they ain't said nothing else. All right. Let him game. Yeah,
[11517.24s -> 11545.59s]  I'm just gaming. Oh, his head shrinks. Okay. Now it just feels like this is the mobile game they
[11545.59s -> 11566.44s]  came out with at the same time as a marketing tool. This is the mobile game. Okay. I'm dead.
[11566.44s -> 11579.77s]  All right. All right. All right. Let's do the sunflowers. It's time. I'm going to take a quick
[11579.77s -> 11585.27s]  break. I'm going to get them over here so I can put them on the screen. We will showcase the
[11585.27s -> 11594.76s]  sunflowers. You have no idea what's going on pretty much every year. The last two or three years,
[11594.76s -> 11604.25s]  although didn't do very much last year, but it's been very, very, very hot. Sunflowers got a ton
[11605.59s -> 11616.78s]  of sun this year, but yeah, I, Holly and I planted a bunch of stuff. We've been very good plant
[11616.78s -> 11627.21s]  parents. At least I hope so. Are they taller than you? Yeah. Here's the thing. The last time we did
[11627.21s -> 11636.42s]  this, we got ones that could go up to eight to 12 feet. I think is what it was. These ones were
[11636.42s -> 11640.26s]  only supposed to go because it's like, Oh, but let's maybe we'll do some smaller ones this year.
[11640.26s -> 11650.52s]  These were supposed to only go four feet and they're still 10 feet tall. These were not the big
[11650.52s -> 11659.78s]  ones. It's just out here in Vegas. The sun just rains down all fucking day. They love it out here.
[11659.78s -> 11669.53s]  They just absorb so many of these sun's rays and we fertilize, you know, fertilize them. All right.
[11669.53s -> 11673.78s]  Give me a minute. I'm going to get it set. I'll come back. We'll hang out for a little bit longer
[11673.78s -> 11678.39s]  and let's do some sunflowers. See you in like four or five minutes. I'm going to pee. I'm going to
[11678.39s -> 11950.68s]  refill my drink. I'll be back. Okay. I am back. I'm going to put some nice music on while we sit here
[11950.68s -> 11966.33s]  for like 15 minutes or so. Let me get some nice music. What should we do for nice music? What do
[11966.33s -> 11979.18s]  you think? How about Stardew? Oh, that's not a bad one. That's right. All right. Stardew.
[11979.90s -> 11999.86s]  We're going to go right in the middle somewhere. Stardew Valley OST. And there it is. Hey, there it
[11999.86s -> 12014.44s]  is. I think that's a good start. Okay. So for those of you that are about to join me on the journey
[12014.44s -> 12025.53s]  for this year's harvest. Okay. Let me figure out how I'm going to do this. How should I do this?
[12031.83s -> 12035.58s]  I think I can just drag them over here. Yeah, this will work. All right. So here
[12036.78s -> 12053.82s]  is the, here are the babies, as you can see. The thing about sunflowers and growing anything,
[12053.82s -> 12060.47s]  it's actually kind of sad what you need to do. So when you plant sunflower seeds, oh wait,
[12060.47s -> 12063.03s]  it doesn't, whatever. You have like a, you know, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that this
[12063.03s -> 12071.14s]  year. You have to thin out the ones that don't really make it. If you're going to do them in a
[12071.14s -> 12077.62s]  pot. Like if, let's just say for instance, you don't have a bunch of land to do like 50 sunflowers in
[12077.62s -> 12087.22s]  a row, you plant, they have to be at least eight inches apart, 12 inches apart. But sometimes,
[12087.22s -> 12094.30s]  as you see here, see the one on the left, that, that guy was ready and he was obviously the
[12094.30s -> 12101.98s]  stronger one. So that was the one that was going to stick around. The other ones, unfortunately,
[12101.98s -> 12111.32s]  they have to go purged. Yeah. And it's always like, no, but if you, I'm going to put you in a
[12111.32s -> 12116.98s]  different pot. And what ends up happening is you end up having, you end up, you end up kind of
[12116.98s -> 12122.68s]  transferring all the ones that weren't going to make it to a different pot. So you just end up
[12122.68s -> 12127.16s]  having a bunch of pots of these ones that kind of don't make it in quotes. You kind of just try to
[12127.16s -> 12138.63s]  spread them around. These ones all lived by the way, these were dwarf sunflowers. So I'll give
[12138.63s -> 12150.36s]  you another picture here. It's the same group. As you can see the one in the back, a little bit,
[12150.36s -> 12160.18s]  a little slow to rise, but all three of these made it. I think that's a pretty good one of them
[12160.18s -> 12169.98s]  down here. There is. Yeah. So the big ones, the ones that we have in a big pot are here.
[12169.98s -> 12189.74s]  Take a look at these ones. So that's how they start. Oh, hold on. What is this doing? There we go.
[12189.74s -> 12193.74s]  They end up getting a little bigger. These ones are different though. These were not,
[12193.74s -> 12202.28s]  these ones are not the little ones. Yeah. Again, we went with three this year. They're very,
[12202.28s -> 12211.37s]  very strong, very healthy. They got to this stage pretty quickly. It was, it was,
[12211.37s -> 12221.72s]  it was like, wow, they're growing really, really, really fast. We didn't just do sunflowers though.
[12221.72s -> 12231.80s]  God, gardening is so nice. Let me show you this. What do you think about this one? So those are
[12231.80s -> 12241.46s]  sunflowers. Take a look, take a look at this one. Ooh, I don't even know. We don't even know what
[12241.46s -> 12246.06s]  this flower is. We just know that it looks really nice and we want to make it look like a national
[12246.06s -> 12259.48s]  geographic photo. This is a wildflower. Don't even know what it is. Is it a tulip? I don't know.
[12259.48s -> 12266.34s]  This opened, this opened wide. You'll see a couple of pictures of it. This thing was open. Here's
[12266.34s -> 12279.32s]  another one from side by side here. So I believe this is the same area. There's a little moth on
[12279.32s -> 12285.69s]  this too. There was a couple of orange ones. There was a few pink ones. There was some blue ones.
[12285.69s -> 12294.63s]  They were all over the place. Oh no, there's a bug. Just getting some shade. There's a couple of
[12294.63s -> 12309.40s]  really, really cute photos. Any more of the tall wildflowers? Yep, I got one here. So this is the
[12309.40s -> 12316.97s]  one that you see on the right. Oh, sorry, on the left. Looking through the, looking through the
[12316.97s -> 12329.00s]  jungle. Ooh, that's what it opened up into. So what is that? We don't really know what it is.
[12329.00s -> 12335.50s]  We just don't, because the wildflower packets, you just shake it out. It's just a ton of different
[12335.50s -> 12358.46s]  random things. It's a Cosmo? Cosmo. That's cool. It's opium. It's not, it's not opium. This dude's
[12358.46s -> 12369.69s]  growing fucking opium. But I know what you're really here for. You're here to see the fucking
[12369.69s -> 12384.47s]  blue wildflower. Same pot? Yeah, same pot. And these just popped up kind of randomly. It's kind
[12384.47s -> 12388.55s]  of cool to walk out here sometimes and be like, wait, there's a purple one now. That's kind of
[12388.55s -> 12406.07s]  cool. Is there any? Let me see. Oh, here's a good one. So this is, this is right before one of the
[12406.07s -> 12418.52s]  sunflowers opened. Take a look at that. So as you can probably see the color this year, we had,
[12418.52s -> 12426.62s]  they were kind of yellow with brown in the middle and they opened like this,
[12426.62s -> 12437.22s]  but then they got to be pretty much yellow. Let's even get that one open. Yeah. Hey, you ready? So
[12437.22s -> 12443.54s]  this is kind of, I don't want to show that one yet. We'll just show this one. We'll show it's
[12443.54s -> 12461.00s]  starting to open. So there's that one. Take a look at this. Ah, it is opening. So really wild color.
[12461.00s -> 12480.46s]  It was like electric in a way. It's so weird because like I said, over time, these actually
[12480.54s -> 12487.11s]  get paler. All that orange in the middle goes away almost completely. Just that's how they start for
[12487.11s -> 12494.22s]  the first week. Do you grow them inside? No, no, these are all outside. They kind of have to be.
[12494.22s -> 12500.90s]  They have to be in direct sun all day. I Googled sunflower and found this on the second page, bro.
[12500.90s -> 12508.01s]  We stopped, we stopped fucking with me. Come on. Like we didn't do sunflowers this year. Okay.
[12508.01s -> 12514.34s]  Fine. What would you, what do you want me to say? Don't, don't, don't get up in here and fuck it up
[12514.34s -> 12529.61s]  for me. So yeah, I want to show you, can I show you my favorite one? And this is a big deal by the
[12529.61s -> 12536.12s]  way. This is a big deal. A lot of times when you grow some flowers, you get yellow, yellow, yellow,
[12536.12s -> 12548.50s]  yellow, yellow, yellow. This year we got a massive orange one and it stayed orange the entire time it
[12548.50s -> 12568.95s]  was here. Bright orange. Let me make it a little smaller. I love the depth of field too. It looks
[12568.95s -> 12585.03s]  so nice. And who's that? It's Otto. Yeah. This thing is the size, the middle there is as big as
[12585.03s -> 12594.30s]  a fucking softball. This was almost two fists together. How big that middle is, is gigantic.
[12594.30s -> 12600.50s]  It's my favorite. I don't want to play favorites, but that's my favorite one this year. Just,
[12600.50s -> 12615.78s]  just saying. It looks stunning. Here is one of the dwarf sunflowers open. Very pretty. And these
[12615.78s -> 12619.62s]  only get to be, and a lot of people say, Hey, this sounds like really fun. This sounds like really
[12619.62s -> 12627.61s]  cool. I can't do that. These are like not even a foot tall. They're tiny. Actually, man, this might
[12627.61s -> 12634.50s]  not be the dwarf one. No, this is just one of the regular ones. See the other head forming on the
[12634.50s -> 12641.86s]  left side there? Yeah. These were vibrant. Sunflowers are so easy. Oh yeah. Absolutely.
[12641.86s -> 12649.00s]  But as long as you, if you, let me learn to talk again. As long as you're in an area that gets a
[12649.00s -> 12658.04s]  ton of sunshine throughout the entire summer season, you'll, it'll work. Sunflowers are pretty
[12658.04s -> 12666.20s]  easy. And they just, they blow up sometimes. Remember I told you that one of them was a Hydra.
[12666.20s -> 12672.71s]  We tried to get some decent pictures of just how many heads appeared on this thing. So let's see.
[12672.71s -> 12683.54s]  Yeah. Take a look at this. Are you ready? Check this shit out. So this is at full growth for
[12684.54s -> 12698.74s]  the one that I was just showing you. It's like a fucking Elden Ring boss. There are one, two, three,
[12698.74s -> 12709.75s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I believe there are 11 heads. It's just trying that they were
[12709.75s -> 12717.88s]  facing the other way. And it's just like, ah, shit. It's all right. It's okay. There's a pretty
[12717.88s -> 12727.67s]  cool one here looking up here. This one too. This is taken from like the bottom looking up.
[12727.67s -> 12737.26s]  This thing was huge. It was probably 10 feet tall and there are heads that are still going to open.
[12737.26s -> 12750.90s]  The photos are awesome. Yeah. This is Holly taking all of these pictures. I took one. Yeah. These are,
[12750.90s -> 12760.41s]  these are all Holly. They are very, very, very good. All right. I'm going to show you something
[12760.41s -> 12769.43s]  now that's going to make you cry. You're going to cry. Hope you're ready. You ready? I don't
[12769.43s -> 12791.06s]  know if you're ready. It's a hummingbird drinking out of the big orange one. Not a, no big deal.
[12791.06s -> 12798.52s]  Yes. We sat staring at these until one showed up. That was an entire afternoon at one point.
[12798.52s -> 12813.48s]  But yeah, we did get a couple of visitors. Speaking of visitors, it was really nice to see.
[12813.48s -> 12819.37s]  I don't know. It makes you feel kind of good. So this is a wasp and they would just kind of pop
[12819.37s -> 12826.68s]  in from time to time. If you don't like wasps, then you know, you're about to see one. But what
[12826.68s -> 12831.70s]  I told you guys last week, I was like, man, when you really kind of just sit here and watch,
[12831.70s -> 12840.47s]  you kind of go, they're just kind of hanging out. So this was a wasp and this wasp found this
[12840.47s -> 12845.85s]  piece of shade here because I told you, it's been insanely hot. It has been a hundred plus 110
[12845.85s -> 12856.68s]  degrees every single day. And this little, this little guy found the shade and slept.
[12856.68s -> 12862.74s]  He literally is sleeping here. He's lying down in the shade. He found a little spot
[12862.74s -> 12871.06s]  and it's just like, it is too hot, man. Yeah. He's actually like lying down,
[12871.06s -> 12882.60s]  just staying out of the, out of the heat. Did he get up? Yeah. No, he's not dead.
[12882.60s -> 12890.10s]  Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him he's dead. No, he got up and flew away like 20 minutes later.
[12890.10s -> 12901.85s]  He's not dead. Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him. Nobody tell him. He got up and flew away
[12901.85s -> 12906.33s]  literally 10 minutes later. It was like, oh, there he goes. Wow. He's, he's still alive.
[12906.33s -> 12922.71s]  All right. He's not dead. Stop saying that. He's not dead. Oh yeah. What do you think about that?
[12926.94s -> 12938.39s]  We got visited by all kinds of creatures, ladybugs, lacewings, bumblebees, honeybees.
[12938.39s -> 12944.71s]  And these are awesome because these eat all the aphids. Something I never knew before doing
[12944.71s -> 12953.82s]  plants and gardening, whatever. There is an entire group of animal that just spawns a hundred million
[12953.82s -> 12961.86s]  times out of fucking nowhere and eats everything that is green. It doesn't even make any sense
[12961.86s -> 12971.05s]  where they come from. Lacewings eat them. Ladybugs eat them. And it was actually pretty under
[12971.05s -> 12978.14s]  control this year. I'm glad that the ecosystem kind of could do it. You should go outside and
[12978.14s -> 12988.92s]  paint yourself green. Why? What are you? Time that, time that person out for like at least five
[12988.92s -> 12996.86s]  minutes. Hey dude, can you go outside and paint yourself green? Like what? And pretend to be a
[12996.86s -> 13010.44s]  flower? Ants farm them. Yeah. Ants want the, the delicious juice that they secrete. So ants will
[13010.44s -> 13016.50s]  farm them. Ants will literally turn them into like these, they just produce this liquid that
[13016.50s -> 13022.50s]  the ants want. So the ants bring them there on purpose and just turn them into bug fucking
[13022.50s -> 13029.48s]  like workers. They essentially have like, it's like, it's like slavery. It's crazy. It's fucked up.
[13029.48s -> 13037.45s]  They literally take these aphids and like make them, it's fucking crazy. It's actually insane.
[13037.45s -> 13042.01s]  If you look into it, go watch or read like anything about how, what ants do to aphids.
[13042.01s -> 13050.07s]  It's like, huh? What are you talking about? They'd, no, they don't do that. Yeah, they do.
[13050.07s -> 13069.43s]  It's fucked up. Farmer ants, bug, the aphids get protection from the ants. I was under the impression
[13069.43s -> 13073.19s]  that they kind of would just like, you go up there and do this and we're going to take your like food
[13073.19s -> 13084.31s]  from you. It's like, it's kind of, it's kind of, is it mutually beneficial? It's kind of like cattle.
[13084.31s -> 13095.45s]  It's like livestock. Yeah. Ants farm them. It's fucked up. Well, we're looking at a cute wasp
[13095.45s -> 13106.17s]  sleeping on a leaf and a ladybug. Okay. Speaking of the other plants, these are, I showed you the,
[13106.17s -> 13110.65s]  why didn't you, actually didn't even see them. This is a good one of the other marigolds. The
[13110.65s -> 13116.73s]  marigold, everything was orange this year. These are marigolds. And the reason why these are here
[13116.73s -> 13125.40s]  is because they help actually deter, which I know the book is kind of out on this, but according to
[13125.40s -> 13131.85s]  some people, marigolds actually repel a lot of insects. They hate them. They don't like the way
[13131.85s -> 13143.16s]  they smell. So this is a little popcorn marigold. Is that a good ground cover? Yeah. Do bugs use
[13143.16s -> 13152.38s]  neti pots? Uh, I don't think so. But over here, look, look at that. Out of focus, but there's one
[13152.38s -> 13158.60s]  of the, see how small they are? That's one of the dwarf sunflowers that you saw before. And you see
[13158.60s -> 13166.12s]  one, two, three, remember in the very beginning? That's them. So we did end up pulling them out
[13166.12s -> 13177.53s]  and putting them in individual pots and they were very happy. They did very well. There's also,
[13177.61s -> 13189.10s]  there's like a couple more I want to show. Let me see. Oh, this one's cool. This is another one
[13189.10s -> 13196.12s]  kind of like looking up at the, the big Hydra. The sense of scale is hard to show, but this thing is
[13196.12s -> 13199.16s]  about 10 feet tall and no, I'm not going to stand next to it because I know a lot of people would
[13199.16s -> 13213.18s]  just like shrink me and make me like four and a half feet tall. Let's show. Ooh, this one. Oh yeah.
[13213.18s -> 13219.29s]  Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Take a look at this one. Remember that hummingbird you saw earlier? Yep.
[13219.29s -> 13228.42s]  Look at how, look at how majestic she is. Yeah. They, they were all, they were all about this.
[13228.42s -> 13244.31s]  They're all over these and we'll show how many more do we have? I think I could show this one
[13244.31s -> 13248.89s]  too. It's actually kind of cool just to see them closed. But for instance, this one here,
[13249.45s -> 13260.63s]  now let me put this one back. Where did it go? Yeah. It's I'll put this one back up. It's so weird
[13260.63s -> 13268.82s]  because before these open, it's almost like there's like magic going on in here because the,
[13268.82s -> 13275.90s]  the head is closed. It just, it stays closed pretty tightly. And then just one day you can start to
[13275.90s -> 13282.23s]  see color in there. And then a day or two later, the whole thing is open. It's so weird that it
[13282.23s -> 13294.38s]  does that. And then a few weeks after this, it generates hundreds of seeds that you then can eat
[13294.38s -> 13301.51s]  or just plant in the ground again. Plants are ridiculous. Nature is insane. How long from start
[13301.51s -> 13309.99s]  to finish? Uh, the first picture is here. Like for instance, these ones here. This was, I want to say,
[13309.99s -> 13316.86s]  because you're supposed to plant them a week or so after there is no chance of a frost because it
[13316.86s -> 13325.56s]  it'll, it destroys them. So once you're past the last frost of the year, so sometimes that's like
[13326.20s -> 13333.30s]  May, sometimes it's mid-May, early May, sometimes it's late May. It really depends on where you are.
[13333.94s -> 13340.06s]  But for us, uh, it was pretty early in May. So this is probably, I want to say like a month
[13340.14s -> 13346.18s]  and a half of growth. Maybe as of these photos, probably like a month, like four to six weeks,
[13346.18s -> 13361.88s]  I want to say. Yeah. So May 6th is when we put them in the ground or May 9th, maybe. And then
[13361.88s -> 13371.98s]  you're seeing these photos as of like a month or so later. Where are their faces? Well, yeah,
[13371.98s -> 13375.90s]  that's what I mean. Like it's, it's so crazy that this thing, right? This like piece of fucking lettuce
[13376.46s -> 13386.20s]  right here develops this on its head. That's just, it does like, that's so wild that this actually
[13386.20s -> 13394.44s]  does this. Hey, well, I'm just, I mean, look at it. It kind of looks like a piece of romaine lettuce.
[13394.44s -> 13402.94s]  And then just one day after getting a lot of nutrients and sun and water, it turns into this.
[13402.94s -> 13416.23s]  Let me get that orange one back up. This thing was rocking for like a week or two straight.
[13416.23s -> 13426.63s]  I think somebody said, would you, would you ever do vegetables? Vegetables kind of scare me
[13426.63s -> 13440.02s]  because, well, I mean, sunflowers are technically food, technically. But the thing about vegetables
[13440.02s -> 13447.62s]  that freaks me out is I almost feel like I would, I don't know. I feel like it's, am I watering them
[13447.62s -> 13453.03s]  enough? Are they going to taste okay? What about the water? Is the water, am I using like, should I
[13453.03s -> 13459.13s]  use like purified water? What if it's going to be like gross water in there? What's the pH of this
[13459.13s -> 13468.07s]  water? I don't know. I feel like I'd freak out about it. You should grow tomatoes. What actually does
[13468.07s -> 13473.14s]  well in Vegas? I always felt like that anything that wasn't something that needs to get scorched
[13473.14s -> 13480.28s]  by the sun just can't really work out here. Sunflowers work out here. Would tomatoes work?
[13480.28s -> 13498.01s]  I feel like tomatoes would just get burnt. Money trees? Well, money tree, can you eat a money tree?
[13498.01s -> 13501.64s]  I feel like that's kind of weird. I don't think I'd want to eat a money tree. Isn't it supposed to,
[13501.64s -> 13504.76s]  you're supposed to have it for like good luck. I feel like, I feel like eating it is getting,
[13504.76s -> 13516.54s]  is bad luck. Dragon fruit, peppers, and, so, wait, dragon fruit would do well out here? Like, that
[13516.54s -> 13528.49s]  sounds actually kind of fun. Holy shit, you can actually grow pumpkins. Really? It was just a
[13528.49s -> 13542.71s]  joke. I didn't even know money trees were real. What? Succulents? I actually think, I think that
[13542.71s -> 13549.59s]  would be, yeah, that'd be really, because, I mean, there's a lot of cactus out here, just naturally.
[13549.67s -> 13557.94s]  It's kind of everywhere. Did you use fertilizer? Yeah, just the generic stuff. Just that, you know,
[13557.94s -> 13563.94s]  the bag you get at Home Depot that has, you know, you can just sprinkle it in and rinse it in there.
[13563.94s -> 13573.02s]  It's pretty, pretty basic stuff. Every two or three weeks, drop it in there. We only did it,
[13573.02s -> 13582.01s]  I want to say, maybe three or four times total. So, every two weeks. Prickly pear? Oh, yeah.
[13582.01s -> 13591.24s]  What the fuck is this stream? It's in the title. It literally says,
[13591.24s -> 13594.12s]  Trey Pang 2 and Sunflower Podcast.
[13594.12s -> 13614.79s]  Grow some peppermint. You should grow aloe for the skin care. That's true. Ban that guy. Nah,
[13614.79s -> 13624.58s]  it's all right. Would you get some creatures for the garden? We get a lot of, they just kind of
[13624.58s -> 13633.53s]  show up. Last time there was praying mantis, there were honey bees. If you have this stuff,
[13633.53s -> 13641.80s]  they kind of just show up on their own. You don't really have to do very much. Just like,
[13641.80s -> 13647.56s]  jump scared you, I'm sorry. Yeah, like sometimes, oh, you know, I need shade. I'm going to hang out
[13647.56s -> 13664.71s]  here. Hummingbirds are so cool. Can I tell you, hummingbirds are my new favorite animal. They're
[13664.71s -> 13674.28s]  just so interesting. I can't even describe how, let me just tell you, they're great. Hummingbird
[13674.28s -> 13683.85s]  feeders. Do you have hummingbird feeders? I sure do. We sure do. They're, that's essentially what
[13683.85s -> 13694.25s]  these are. They are hummingbird feeders. That's kind of one of the points to do it in the first
[13694.25s -> 13710.87s]  place. But yeah, that's probably it. That's pretty much it. Got to go over a bunch of them.
[13710.87s -> 13716.57s]  I think we, there's a, there's a few more that we have that are really big close-ups, especially
[13716.57s -> 13724.57s]  after we harvested some of them. So we can show, if you want to see, hold on, did I show,
[13724.57s -> 13732.54s]  I'll show this one too. So this one, oh no, we already saw that one. We already saw that one.
[13732.54s -> 13743.16s]  Okay. This one looks, oh, this, this is a good one. Take a look at this one. So this is sort of how
[13743.16s -> 13747.62s]  they were set near each other. You're wondering, just kind of in placement, like, wait, where's
[13747.62s -> 13755.29s]  that orange one? So there's the Hydra and there's the orange one. And as you see, see the one in the
[13755.29s -> 13762.76s]  middle on the right? That one is ready for harvest. You essentially, once they're ready,
[13762.76s -> 13769.29s]  you snip off the head and there it is. And there's your seeds in there. You just kind of fish them
[13769.29s -> 13781.66s]  out. Yeah, you can see the color difference now too, much better. That sort of sprinkled in orange
[13781.66s -> 13794.90s]  brown on the right one, the one on the left is like fire orange. Do you cook them? No. For the
[13794.90s -> 13802.98s]  most part, it's more of, I want to keep these because I want it. I want to plant these ones
[13802.98s -> 13809.93s]  next year. So you kind of keep the family. Now there's hundreds of them. So yeah, you can,
[13809.93s -> 13814.63s]  you could cook, you can toast them up and eat them if you really wanted to take them out of
[13814.63s -> 13824.84s]  the shells, toast them up. Yeah. There you go. There's this, there are the sunflowers. There's
[13824.84s -> 13835.24s]  your big fiery orange sunflower. And then the, the family of 11 heads, very, it was wild this year.
[13842.09s -> 13851.24s]  You need to name them. The one on the left is Blaze and the one on the right is Cerberus.
[13851.24s -> 13872.63s]  You don't think we've already gone over this? Many, many times. Where's Otto? He's right here.
[13872.63s -> 13897.37s]  You didn't see? It's Otto. All right, that's going to wrap it up. Short stream today, but
[13897.37s -> 13907.40s]  you know, there'll be a lot more of these. I had fun. It's a good day. The next time I see you,
[13907.40s -> 13914.58s]  here is the plan. Sunday we are going to do Team Fortress 2. I got to say it again. Make sure you,
[13914.58s -> 13918.71s]  you know, clear your ears out a little and go, wait, what did he just say? Team Fortress
[13918.71s -> 13924.15s]  2 on Sunday. I'm going to play it for an hour or two. See how I like it. See if I'm getting into
[13924.15s -> 13936.82s]  it again. And then after that, probably start viewfinder. Play that for a couple of hours.
[13936.82s -> 13946.52s]  That's the plan for Sunday. Hey, botanist here. Ooh, hold on. Some fun info about sunflowers is
[13946.52s -> 13954.82s]  each place that bears a seed is a singular flower. Each head houses hundreds of singular flowers,
[13954.82s -> 13961.85s]  two different kinds too. Disk flowers and ray flowers. The middle flowers are the disk once,
[13962.41s -> 13967.94s]  and the ones along the rim are ray flowers. Each ray flower has a huge petal. Yeah, they're all
[13967.94s -> 13974.38s]  into that. That's wild. We've got botanists here. We have scientists here. We have doctors here. We
[13974.38s -> 13987.91s]  have lawyers. Most educated community on earth, by the way, on earth, I said. All right. I'll see you
[13987.91s -> 13992.47s]  guys later. Thanks for watching. See you Sunday. Probably starting around the same time, around
[13992.47s -> 14004.78s]  three o'clock. Hope you enjoyed the sunflowers. It was about a month and a half to get them there.
[14004.78s -> 14014.17s]  Marigolds, the wildflowers. They're still around too. I'll probably show a couple more pictures
[14014.17s -> 14020.79s]  later because the wildflowers are still going strong. There's a few more heads that are going
[14020.79s -> 14030.10s]  to open on the orange one. So maybe we'll do an update in another week or so. Yeah. See you guys
[14030.10s -> 14035.61s]  on Sunday around three o'clock. Take care of yourselves. Thanks for hanging out. Trippang
[14035.61s -> 14040.15s]  too is, I would think that's probably one of the most fun games I've played this year. You want a
[14040.15s -> 14045.45s]  real assessment of that. That's probably up there in the top five games I've played this year. It
[14045.45s -> 14051.80s]  was just very fun. You can challenge yourself like crazy in that game and it's really interesting.
[14051.80s -> 14058.15s]  You can go as hard or as easy as you want. I thought it was great. I would say that it was
[14058.15s -> 14070.07s]  very good. Dude, you've only played like six games. That's in the top five. What's the one
[14070.07s -> 14076.97s]  game that came out this year that I played that I've really despised apparently? I don't know.
[14076.97s -> 14086.55s]  What have I not mentioned? Gollum? Yeah, yeah, that's true. Diablo IV. Yeah, I didn't really
[14086.55s -> 14092.52s]  talk about it, did I? No. Yeah, we don't need to get into it. We don't need to get, we don't
[14092.52s -> 14096.46s]  need to get into it. You know what I'm saying? We don't need to get into it. I'll be here for
[14096.46s -> 14100.41s]  another six hours. We're not going to get into it. I'll be here for six more hours.
[14109.78s -> 14118.50s]  Get into it. I'll see you Sunday. Maybe one day I'll get into it. When are you going to
[14118.50s -> 14128.49s]  do the browser game and quiz stream? That's true. We do need to do that. We'll do it soon.
[14128.49s -> 14140.63s]  Sorcery part four also as well. Dude, start ranting now. No, we just showed off all the
[14140.63s -> 14147.00s]  sunflowers. I'm in a really good mood. I don't want to get into it because then I'll get all
[14147.00s -> 14153.80s]  hot. The room will heat up. I'll have to go get a bunch of water and I'll be pacing back and forth
[14153.80s -> 14161.42s]  for the next hour off stream thinking about it. I got it. Yeah, I got to log off. Let's log off
[14161.42s -> 14172.65s]  for a little while. Hey, say happy birthday to my cat Goober. He turned one today. Happy birthday,
[14172.65s -> 14181.78s]  Goober the cat. All right. I'll see you guys Sunday. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother,
[14181.78s -> 14188.18s]  call your father. Hey, do something nice for yourself today. Do something nice for yourself
[14188.18s -> 14201.99s]  today. You understand? Hey, do something nice for yourself today. See you guys later. Take care.
[14202.07s -> 14254.30s]  See you Sunday. Have a great one. I'm also going to wait till four hours so it looks much better on
[14254.30s -> 14261.96s]  paper. You know how it is. It just like, you know, four hours looks just on paper looks a lot better.
[14262.68s -> 14268.62s]  I got just enough time to talk about D4 and I get it out in two minutes.
[14270.34s -> 14273.88s]  All right, let's get into it. I'm gonna get into it. I got two minutes.
[14276.49s -> 14286.50s]  I can't get it. I can't get into it. I can't get into it. It's like a whole, I have like a whole,
[14286.50s -> 14291.29s]  I'm like just a whole thing about like modern video games and how it's almost like things are
[14291.29s -> 14297.93s]  being they're not being made. No, I can't get into it. We have two minutes. I actually can't
[14297.93s -> 14312.20s]  get into it. I just picking up Saigon's boots fucking eight times and that's the only item that
[14312.20s -> 14316.73s]  you that drops something going on there. That's true. You know what I mean? Or like, you know,
[14316.73s -> 14322.17s]  distant enemies are stunned for four seconds for the 15th time as an aspect. I just don't like this.
[14322.17s -> 14325.77s]  That doesn't do it for me at all. That just doesn't do it for me at all. This doesn't do it
[14325.77s -> 14339.46s]  for me at all. Go off. Go off. Log off. I'm going off. I'm going off. All right.
[14341.48s -> 14346.44s]  Holy shit, dude. Wow. Super hot take. Oh, wow, dude. Did you hear that?
[14346.44s -> 14353.48s]  No way. Nobody else has that take. Only German says that. Whoa, dude. He's so brave for giving
[14353.48s -> 14359.88s]  his take on D4. Dude, no one else has said this. Not like six or seven million people that have all
[14359.88s -> 14367.51s]  said that exact same thing. Dude, you are. You are. Whoa. You are a visionary, by the way.
[14368.31s -> 14395.26s]  We're almost at four hours. We're good. These are CCO takes. I like how Diablo one just had a sword.
[14397.53s -> 14400.73s]  It just it just I don't know. I just feel like I was like working.
[14402.65s -> 14406.49s]  Does that make sense? I feel like I was like working when I was playing. It's like I was at
[14406.49s -> 14415.94s]  I was like working. I was at work. I would go to work and then I would just salvage my entire
[14415.94s -> 14432.17s]  inventory. He missed it. Oh, because the foot. No, it's fine. We're at overtime. Yeah, we're good.
[14432.17s -> 14441.88s]  I can hit 420. No, I can't. I can hit. Let's try for four, one, four, one, two, three. OK,
[14441.88s -> 14461.67s]  we're going to do four, one, two, three. No, not four, one, two, three, four. Yeah. See you Sunday.
[14463.43s -> 14476.98s]  All right, here comes four, one, two, three. See if I can get it. Take care.
