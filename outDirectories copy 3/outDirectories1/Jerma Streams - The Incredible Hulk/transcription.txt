[0.50s -> 19.51s]  This next game is going to be fairly interesting to some of you. It's going to be a nice surprise.
[19.51s -> 34.70s]  I'm actually going to, I'm going to mute. I know there's at least 5500ish people here right now.
[34.70s -> 38.70s]  I guarantee at least 200 of you just like absolutely clog your pants.
[38.70s -> 46.71s]  I'm going to shave your pants. Let's turn it off so you can't hear what it is.
[46.71s -> 58.85s]  I don't want you to know. You say that for every game. Of course I do.
[58.85s -> 77.24s]  Okay. I'm calling it right now. It's Pikmin. No it's not. No it is not. Something else.
[77.24s -> 91.63s]  Okay I don't want you to hear this. Oh man it's a really crunchy loud one.
[91.63s -> 95.19s]  Holy shit. Hopefully this doesn't do this through the whole game.
[95.19s -> 99.26s]  Okay hold on. You ready? I'm going to give you a hint.
[99.26s -> 135.18s]  Ladies and gentlemen please if you would hold on to your seats for...
[139.50s -> 146.18s]  A game by Sega. We're talking of course about...
[146.18s -> 156.36s]  That's not the title of the game. Not Edge of Reality.
[158.36s -> 177.30s]  That's not the game also. Talking about Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[177.30s -> 194.71s]  Am I sure this is not the sound clips that I was playing yesterday?
[194.71s -> 214.46s]  It's wicked loud is it? Let's go. Story mode.
[214.46s -> 228.08s]  The werewolf? This is not The Bachelor. Should I just keep it on The Bachelor?
[228.08s -> 235.82s]  Welcome to The Bachelor. I didn't get the rose.
[235.82s -> 238.82s]  That's illegal. That's twitch illegal.
[238.82s -> 247.06s]  I'm trying to stop a monster. Edward Norton or pretend somebody is doing an Edward Norton voice.
[247.06s -> 269.29s]  Which one? What is it? The Incredible Hulk. The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[269.29s -> 274.29s]  The Incredible Hulk. The Pantheon Saga. Hulk Hogan's main event.
[274.29s -> 284.23s]  The Incredible Hulk.
[284.23s -> 294.02s]  Should I have a missile in here?
[294.02s -> 303.37s]  Alright let's go. This is so fucking loud too. Hold on.
[303.37s -> 310.92s]  I'm going to turn this shit down.
[310.92s -> 318.89s]  What the fuck was that? Press B or Z to punch?
[318.89s -> 322.51s]  I don't even know whether it was B or Z.
[322.51s -> 335.53s]  Get through the door. Alright!
[335.53s -> 339.02s]  Hey! What's going on everybody?
[339.02s -> 344.02s]  Jerma here with a live broadcast stream. Welcome to the stream everybody.
[344.02s -> 347.02s]  Playing The Incredible Hulk action.
[347.02s -> 355.41s]  I can just walk into shit.
[355.41s -> 378.49s]  Take and take care everybody.
[378.49s -> 383.33s]  Alright this is Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[383.33s -> 398.14s]  Think about it. When am I going to throw my first car?
[398.14s -> 406.52s]  It's actually kind of fun.
[406.52s -> 410.30s]  Can I get rid of the helicopter?
[410.30s -> 414.88s]  I can Q up a punch. Hold on I can do a running punch.
[414.88s -> 421.60s]  Why am I not playing the good Hulk game?
[421.60s -> 424.60s]  This is not the right video game.
[424.60s -> 429.14s]  This is the wrong video game.
[429.14s -> 438.70s]  Look, it's Hulk Break Shit the game.
[438.70s -> 440.70s]  Is it really that big of a difference?
[440.70s -> 458.06s]  Yes? You tell me there's a difference?
[458.06s -> 463.68s]  What is this one called?
[463.68s -> 465.68s]  This is an extremely big difference.
[465.68s -> 472.02s]  It's not Madden.
[472.02s -> 477.37s]  This is not Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[482.00s -> 485.00s]  Oh, it's the movie tie-in game.
[485.00s -> 496.26s]  It's the movie tie-in licensed movie game.
[496.26s -> 499.26s]  The one for the GameCube was just a game that was made for the GameCube.
[499.26s -> 501.26s]  Not a licensed. It's the movie.
[501.26s -> 507.58s]  That's why Edward Norton's in this movie.
[507.58s -> 520.70s]  But we're playing it anyways.
[520.70s -> 523.45s]  But you can do this in this one.
[523.45s -> 525.45s]  Hulk's health is dangerously low. Heal.
[525.45s -> 528.45s]  Press left or right to select Hulk's healing factor.
[528.45s -> 530.45s]  Then shake the nunchuck and press B.
[530.45s -> 543.76s]  That was dumb.
[548.84s -> 555.56s]  Can I pick up weapons?
[555.56s -> 563.90s]  Beats our challenge as Hulk completes to earn new powers and enhancements.
[563.90s -> 566.90s]  When he completes a feat, the upgrade indicator appears.
[566.90s -> 571.90s]  Press 1 to access the upgrade screen and see the newly completed feat and associated upgrade.
[571.90s -> 581.14s]  Healing factor. Hulk has innate ability to heal.
[581.14s -> 584.81s]  Oh, there's like a Street Fighter menu.
[584.81s -> 588.81s]  Punching bag is BBBB. Body toss is Z.
[588.81s -> 593.72s]  How do you grab?
[593.72s -> 597.72s]  ZZZZZZZZZB.
[597.72s -> 600.73s]  Grab is down.
[600.73s -> 606.58s]  Alright, cool. Let's go back.
[606.58s -> 610.55s]  That's grab. Alright, I'm ready.
[610.55s -> 613.62s]  What's the deal with the Hulk?
[613.62s -> 618.73s]  Pick up an object.
[618.73s -> 621.73s]  And you guys all thought this was going to be like a boring game.
[621.73s -> 623.73s]  But now I can throw shit at people.
[623.73s -> 626.80s]  Hold down C to target.
[626.80s -> 635.89s]  That's C.
[635.89s -> 638.45s]  Wait, that's not C?
[638.45s -> 641.94s]  Hold down C to target.
[641.94s -> 650.84s]  Alright, I've got somebody's...
[650.84s -> 653.53s]  I was going to make an internal organ joke.
[653.53s -> 656.34s]  C.
[656.34s -> 658.34s]  Hold down C to target.
[658.34s -> 667.75s]  That's C, right?
[667.75s -> 683.61s]  I did it.
[683.61s -> 689.10s]  Who's this?
[689.10s -> 700.55s]  Defeat Blonsky.
[700.55s -> 702.55s]  Alright, I just embarrassed this guy.
[702.55s -> 704.55s]  Just keep going.
[704.55s -> 708.84s]  Into the wall.
[708.84s -> 713.26s]  It's a gorilla.
[713.26s -> 717.99s]  Wait, what is it? Hold down...what is it?
[717.99s -> 725.93s]  Oh, this.
[725.93s -> 748.78s]  Watch me do this.
[748.78s -> 759.21s]  Keep playing. I'm going to keep playing.
[759.21s -> 762.86s]  Just wait until I get out and I can jump around in cars.
[780.44s -> 782.44s]  Oh, and then you're going to ask.
[791.46s -> 793.46s]  This is literally the movie.
[801.30s -> 803.30s]  It's just the movie.
[803.30s -> 805.30s]  NSA listening post.
[805.30s -> 817.91s]  Undisclosed location.
[823.91s -> 825.91s]  That's Ed Norton.
[833.91s -> 835.91s]  It is.
[835.91s -> 837.91s]  That's a good Ed Norton.
[837.91s -> 843.74s]  At the bottom of the screen is the minimap showing
[843.74s -> 845.74s]  Hulk and the surrounding area.
[845.74s -> 866.86s]  I didn't even do that one.
[866.86s -> 868.86s]  I didn't do that one either.
[868.86s -> 870.86s]  I didn't do that.
[870.86s -> 874.76s]  He just drove into the wall and
[874.76s -> 876.76s]  exploded.
[876.76s -> 881.82s]  Hey, easy.
[912.97s -> 914.97s]  Why can you do that?
[914.97s -> 916.97s]  In the Spider-Man game you couldn't do that.
[916.97s -> 919.34s]  You couldn't do
[919.34s -> 921.34s]  this shit in the Spider-Man game?
[921.34s -> 924.73s]  You go like, oh, have a good day.
[924.73s -> 926.73s]  I'm Spider-Man in the Hulk.
[926.73s -> 928.73s]  Why can I just fucking
[928.73s -> 940.70s]  blast that lady?
[940.70s -> 943.00s]  Why?
[971.02s -> 974.14s]  He's eating a candy stick.
[974.14s -> 976.14s]  Baby Hulk is upset.
[976.14s -> 1003.38s]  Why?
[1003.38s -> 1005.38s]  It's so funny.
[1005.38s -> 1007.38s]  It's fucking hilarious.
[1007.38s -> 1011.48s]  In a building?
[1011.48s -> 1014.04s]  Wait, I can't
[1014.04s -> 1016.04s]  battlefield this building.
[1016.04s -> 1018.04s]  Can I?
[1018.04s -> 1020.04s]  And all you motherfuckers wanted me to change
[1020.04s -> 1032.90s]  the game.
[1032.90s -> 1037.83s]  Can I?
[1037.83s -> 1045.96s]  I lost my pole.
[1045.96s -> 1055.62s]  What do I have to go?
[1062.78s -> 1067.19s]  I'm going to go this way.
[1067.19s -> 1070.39s]  Pick somebody up.
[1070.39s -> 1095.19s]  Help him.
[1095.19s -> 1097.19s]  I'm the reason why he needed
[1097.19s -> 1101.86s]  to be helped.
[1101.86s -> 1106.79s]  It's fucking unbelievable.
[1106.79s -> 1109.48s]  I don't care if I don't even play
[1109.48s -> 1111.48s]  this game for another 20 fucking minutes.
[1111.48s -> 1117.56s]  Who gives a shit if it's worth it?
[1117.56s -> 1122.30s]  The other Hulk game is better.
[1122.30s -> 1124.30s]  Those don't look like army forces.
[1124.30s -> 1126.30s]  They're attacking the city.
[1126.30s -> 1128.30s]  It looks strong, but Hulk is stronger.
[1128.30s -> 1136.94s]  Show them just how strong he is.
[1136.94s -> 1139.56s]  Holy shit.
[1139.56s -> 1142.25s]  It's just this
[1142.25s -> 1144.25s]  but better?
[1144.25s -> 1151.54s]  Is it?
[1151.54s -> 1153.54s]  Alright, I'll get it.
[1153.54s -> 1155.54s]  I'll get it immediately. It'll be here in fucking two days.
[1155.54s -> 1170.46s]  It'll be here in
[1170.46s -> 1180.95s]  two days. Guaranteed.
[1180.95s -> 1182.95s]  Wait, this is not a bad guy?
[1182.95s -> 1185.83s]  This is not a bad guy.
[1185.83s -> 1195.94s]  This it was? Look,
[1195.94s -> 1203.82s]  it was on the minimap.
[1203.82s -> 1210.98s]  That guy was already dead.
[1210.98s -> 1212.98s]  I can't wait. You're telling me it's just a better version of the
[1212.98s -> 1214.98s]  other one? Oh man, I can't wait.
[1214.98s -> 1218.63s]  I can't pick this shit up?
[1218.63s -> 1248.18s]  It looks like broke the guy's neck.
[1248.18s -> 1250.18s]  Why did it explode?
[1250.18s -> 1252.18s]  Oh shit.
[1252.18s -> 1264.28s]  Stand next to buildings and jump by pressing
[1264.28s -> 1266.28s]  to cling to the side of a building.
[1266.28s -> 1269.99s]  Wait, I can jump up here too?
[1269.99s -> 1271.99s]  Okay, I can't wait to play the new one.
[1271.99s -> 1274.74s]  I get to experience the new one.
[1274.74s -> 1276.74s]  Fuck your AC.
[1276.74s -> 1288.97s]  It's actually older.
[1288.97s -> 1298.81s]  It is older.
[1298.81s -> 1308.52s]  It's seen us.
[1308.52s -> 1310.52s]  Jump higher or farther, hold down A.
[1310.52s -> 1336.55s]  I fucking love this.
[1336.55s -> 1338.55s]  It's Mario Sunshine all over again.
[1338.55s -> 1360.18s]  How durable is this guy?
[1360.18s -> 1362.18s]  Uh, pretty durable.
[1362.18s -> 1364.18s]  No, they're playing laser tag.
[1364.18s -> 1375.56s]  I don't think he's...
[1375.56s -> 1396.04s]  He had a health bar.
[1396.04s -> 1400.20s]  Dude, you're telling me to do like a charge.
[1400.20s -> 1402.20s]  I don't even need to do that. Alright, where are they at?
[1402.20s -> 1404.20s]  I'm ready for them.
[1404.20s -> 1419.37s]  How do you move the camera?
[1419.37s -> 1428.65s]  Holy fuck, that move is so ridiculous.
[1428.65s -> 1442.14s]  Climb!
[1442.14s -> 1459.34s]  Climb!
[1459.34s -> 1461.90s]  Okay, we're good. Probably lose to the helicopter.
[1461.90s -> 1465.85s]  Oh, we're good. No, I did it.
[1465.85s -> 1471.93s]  This looks like a mobile game.
[1471.93s -> 1473.93s]  Oh, plot armor.
[1473.93s -> 1475.93s]  That makes sense.
[1475.93s -> 1480.22s]  I've never even seen this movie.
[1485.14s -> 1493.82s]  Dude, they're like baseball swing
[1493.82s -> 1495.82s]  with the telephone pole.
[1500.18s -> 1502.18s]  So unnecessary.
[1502.18s -> 1504.18s]  They use Manhattan as a giant test site.
[1504.18s -> 1506.18s]  The jokesters on the roof?
[1506.18s -> 1508.18s]  Specialists in artificial intelligence
[1508.18s -> 1510.18s]  that's morphed into mind control.
[1510.18s -> 1512.18s]  I came across some stuff that I shouldn't have.
[1512.18s -> 1514.18s]  I know these guys have to be stopped.
[1514.18s -> 1516.18s]  Whatever you were about to say.
[1516.18s -> 1518.18s]  Full on face scan.
[1518.18s -> 1520.18s]  It isn't on anyone's side.
[1520.18s -> 1522.18s]  He helped me, right?
[1522.18s -> 1524.18s]  I guarantee you there is a video that you unlock
[1524.18s -> 1526.18s]  where it's Ed Norton
[1526.18s -> 1528.18s]  getting his face scanned.
[1528.18s -> 1532.09s]  Put this transmitter in your ear.
[1532.09s -> 1534.09s]  Hopefully it'll survive your transformation.
[1534.09s -> 1536.09s]  Where'd you get this?
[1536.09s -> 1538.09s]  You'd be amazed at what you can find in places you shouldn't be looking.
[1538.09s -> 1540.09s]  Watch your back, by the way.
[1540.09s -> 1542.09s]  There's a large military presence in town.
[1542.09s -> 1544.09s]  It's gonna be like a Viggo Mortensen
[1544.09s -> 1546.09s]  Lord of the Rings interview.
[1562.02s -> 1564.02s]  What's the first thing you do in GTA?
[1564.02s -> 1566.02s]  I see all the D faces.
[1566.02s -> 1568.02s]  The first thing you do when you open up GTA
[1568.02s -> 1570.02s]  is you turn and you punch the closest person
[1570.02s -> 1573.16s]  in the face next to you.
[1573.16s -> 1575.16s]  That's the tutorial in GTA.
[1575.16s -> 1581.88s]  And when you do it, you go,
[1581.88s -> 1596.47s]  Oh, shit!
[1596.47s -> 1605.88s]  Oh, I gotta go this way.
[1605.88s -> 1609.98s]  Are there any other cars besides taxis and trucks?
[1609.98s -> 1611.98s]  Leon Clavin, Rick Jones, part 2.
[1611.98s -> 1614.92s]  Why am I just walking around like this?
[1614.92s -> 1616.92s]  Don't people know who the Hulk is?
[1616.92s -> 1619.10s]  Oh, no, this is the movie
[1619.10s -> 1621.10s]  licensed standalone movie.
[1621.10s -> 1630.82s]  This is pre-
[1630.82s -> 1632.82s]  stop frowning. I can't help it. I have a huge problem.
[1632.82s -> 1636.09s]  Fight the army.
[1636.09s -> 1651.45s]  I always
[1651.45s -> 1653.88s]  swing with it.
[1653.88s -> 1662.46s]  Give me one of the trees. I'm gonna get a tree.
[1662.46s -> 1676.52s]  Give me a tree.
[1676.52s -> 1687.21s]  I know those soldiers are bugging you, but
[1687.21s -> 1689.21s]  I just got a lead on an Enclave lab
[1689.21s -> 1691.21s]  hidden in a building. Thinking you'd knock
[1691.21s -> 1693.21s]  that sucker down. Giant toothpick.
[1693.21s -> 1697.24s]  The icon fades. The farther Hulk is from
[1697.24s -> 1699.24s]  the object, it indicates. As Hulk gets close
[1699.24s -> 1706.09s]  to the icon, it becomes more solid.
[1706.09s -> 1716.78s]  Hulk can't do
[1716.78s -> 1725.85s]  this.
[1725.85s -> 1727.85s]  By breaking an ATM? This is an
[1727.85s -> 1729.85s]  Enclave base. The Paragon Corporation
[1729.85s -> 1731.85s]  sign is a giveaway. Paragon
[1731.85s -> 1733.85s]  is the front company for the Enclave
[1733.85s -> 1735.85s]  and they leave buildings all over the city.
[1738.02s -> 1745.94s]  Open it. Hulk can destroy
[1745.94s -> 1747.94s]  buildings all around the city, but not without attracting
[1747.94s -> 1749.94s]  attention.
[1749.94s -> 1756.92s]  What are you doing?
[1756.92s -> 1758.92s]  Why are you driving directly?
[1758.92s -> 1760.92s]  I have no power
[1760.92s -> 1766.42s]  on this.
[1766.42s -> 1768.42s]  The ambulance isn't gonna do it, right? Of course, at least
[1768.42s -> 1788.65s]  the ambulance is smart. What is that?
[1788.65s -> 1790.89s]  What does the woman do over there?
[1790.89s -> 1792.89s]  What am I trying to grab? What is that thing?
[1792.89s -> 1799.59s]  Was this a person?
[1799.59s -> 1801.59s]  I still want to pick up a fucking rock.
[1801.59s -> 1804.34s]  Hulk can now perform combo attacks
[1804.34s -> 1823.16s]  with a shield. Okay.
[1823.16s -> 1825.66s]  Why would the Hulk need a shield?
[1825.66s -> 1835.45s]  I just bounced him. Let's go.
[1835.45s -> 1844.02s]  Down. Down. Swing down.
[1844.02s -> 1846.20s]  Swing down. Swing down.
[1846.20s -> 1848.20s]  This game being on the Wii,
[1848.20s -> 1850.20s]  was this game on PlayStation 2?
[1850.20s -> 1857.37s]  I feel like it probably was.
[1857.37s -> 1863.38s]  Yes, it was. I charged it up.
[1863.38s -> 1874.39s]  I can fly with this thing?
[1874.39s -> 1883.67s]  What am I supposed to be doing?
[1883.67s -> 1888.09s]  Boss has more men down here than you could believe.
[1888.09s -> 1890.09s]  This is the kill of these guys.
[1890.09s -> 1892.09s]  I think you're gonna be able to stop a strike team once it's activated.
[1892.09s -> 1894.09s]  Your only option is to lie low and wait
[1894.09s -> 1896.09s]  for things to blow over. Wait, there's like a
[1896.09s -> 1898.09s]  getaway from the cops? Get to the subway.
[1898.09s -> 1900.09s]  You should be able to lose the army in the tunnel.
[1900.09s -> 1902.09s]  Holy shit.
[1902.09s -> 1904.09s]  Hulk can use the subway to move around the city faster.
[1904.09s -> 1906.09s]  The yellow circle S
[1906.09s -> 1908.09s]  on the menu have the subway locations.
[1908.09s -> 1910.65s]  They get a new shield at any time.
[1910.65s -> 1912.65s]  Press A, B while unarmed.
[1912.65s -> 1921.67s]  And on the ground.
[1921.67s -> 1926.60s]  Get out of here. I gotta move. I gotta go.
[1926.60s -> 1931.59s]  You can also fly.
[1931.59s -> 1933.59s]  Hulk GTA on mobile.
[1933.59s -> 1940.31s]  This does look like one of those reskins.
[1940.31s -> 1942.31s]  Where the guy
[1942.31s -> 1944.31s]  made 10
[1944.31s -> 1946.31s]  GTA clones and they all have
[1946.31s -> 1948.31s]  licensed characters.
[1948.31s -> 1956.74s]  Did I make it? Wait.
[1956.74s -> 1958.74s]  I just had to walk in it.
[1958.74s -> 1962.26s]  Okay.
[1962.26s -> 1964.50s]  Mission complete.
[1964.50s -> 1967.51s]  Subway is open.
[1967.51s -> 1970.14s]  Oh shit. It costs
[1970.14s -> 1972.14s]  $5 on the app store.
[1972.14s -> 1978.22s]  Travel the New York subway system.
[1978.22s -> 1980.22s]  The map is kind of big.
[1980.22s -> 1982.78s]  It's kind of a big map.
[1982.78s -> 1988.66s]  How does Hulk ride the bus?
[1988.66s -> 1990.66s]  How does Hulk get on the train?
[1990.66s -> 2007.05s]  He walks in the tunnels.
[2007.05s -> 2012.79s]  Oh.
[2012.79s -> 2016.06s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[2016.06s -> 2018.06s]  Let's get as high as we can and we gotta get to the top
[2018.06s -> 2020.06s]  of the Empire State Building and look down like you do in
[2020.06s -> 2033.62s]  Spider-Man.
[2033.62s -> 2038.04s]  No fall damage.
[2038.04s -> 2040.04s]  The four enclave sectors have hidden their bases at key locations
[2040.04s -> 2042.22s]  in the city. Occasionally they will send out an assault group
[2042.22s -> 2044.22s]  to test the destructive power of their weapons.
[2044.22s -> 2048.81s]  Warning.
[2048.81s -> 2050.81s]  An enclave assault group is active.
[2050.81s -> 2053.88s]  Oh shit. I went too far.
[2053.88s -> 2062.25s]  This game came out before
[2062.25s -> 2066.15s]  prototype.
[2066.15s -> 2071.72s]  This game is actually kind of cool.
[2071.72s -> 2073.72s]  Is the stark tower
[2073.72s -> 2077.11s]  here? Where's stark
[2077.11s -> 2079.35s]  tower? Wait. What's this?
[2079.35s -> 2081.35s]  What was it? Did you see that? What was that?
[2081.35s -> 2083.85s]  It was like a little ring up here.
[2083.85s -> 2085.85s]  How do I move the camera?
[2085.85s -> 2100.68s]  Click the YouTube link.
[2100.68s -> 2102.68s]  Click the link. Wait, wait, wait.
[2102.68s -> 2110.68s]  What is it? What is it? This needs music.
[2110.68s -> 2113.88s]  Oh, I see.
[2113.88s -> 2147.59s]  Ground pound.
[2147.59s -> 2167.29s]  Skip.
[2167.29s -> 2171.88s]  Is it me talking?
[2171.88s -> 2174.12s]  We have to hurry. Can you
[2174.12s -> 2178.09s]  carry me? I'm carrying
[2178.09s -> 2185.11s]  this person?
[2185.11s -> 2187.11s]  You don't want to be here.
[2187.11s -> 2189.48s]  I'm wearing this. This guy's a human backpack.
[2189.48s -> 2202.22s]  Hulk found his first
[2202.22s -> 2204.22s]  fury canister.
[2204.22s -> 2207.86s]  There are another 99 hidden
[2207.86s -> 2209.86s]  throughout New York City. Collect more to increase
[2209.86s -> 2211.86s]  Hulk's rage.
[2211.86s -> 2213.86s]  Ugh.
[2213.86s -> 2230.44s]  Ultimate destruction.
[2230.44s -> 2233.45s]  Did somebody just fly?
[2233.45s -> 2236.97s]  Alright, get over here.
[2236.97s -> 2262.49s]  Oh, we're out of time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time.
[2262.49s -> 2264.49s]  Oh, it felt good.
[2264.49s -> 2286.63s]  This character is just like
[2286.63s -> 2291.24s]  I'm not, yeah.
[2291.24s -> 2293.24s]  Give me that.
[2293.24s -> 2302.71s]  Give me, give me, give me, give me,
[2302.71s -> 2311.80s]  give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[2311.80s -> 2313.80s]  He just got squashed.
[2313.80s -> 2319.50s]  Are they down below?
[2319.50s -> 2322.18s]  Done?
[2322.18s -> 2333.75s]  Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[2333.75s -> 2337.46s]  My sources, these bombs came from
[2337.46s -> 2339.46s]  a specific research facility.
[2339.46s -> 2355.06s]  Hmm.
[2355.06s -> 2357.06s]  Go on the top right.
[2357.06s -> 2365.32s]  Nice throw.
[2365.32s -> 2367.32s]  Ooh, it's stuck in the building.
[2367.32s -> 2376.73s]  You move with the game? Yes, I do.
[2376.73s -> 2379.03s]  I'm one of those fucking psychos.
[2379.03s -> 2391.26s]  Come here, come here, come here, come here,
[2391.26s -> 2393.26s]  come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[2393.26s -> 2408.41s]  You!
[2408.41s -> 2416.71s]  Hey, you!
[2416.71s -> 2418.71s]  This, this more?
[2418.71s -> 2425.30s]  That's it.
[2425.30s -> 2427.30s]  Defeat the remaining fuck.
[2427.30s -> 2443.11s]  Shit, canisters, a fanabase.
[2443.11s -> 2454.50s]  Punch him!
[2454.50s -> 2463.78s]  How many more are left?
[2463.78s -> 2466.09s]  Oh, this guy here.
[2466.09s -> 2480.73s]  See ya.
[2482.73s -> 2486.50s]  Top right, be like, what?
[2486.50s -> 2488.50s]  What are you talking about? Top right, what the fuck?
[2488.50s -> 2499.19s]  What? It's you.
[2499.19s -> 2507.58s]  I'm bringing a truck with me this time.
[2534.47s -> 2536.47s]  Alright, did he fall? Alright.
[2536.47s -> 2538.47s]  Don't forget about me, I won't.
[2538.47s -> 2541.10s]  Alright, here we go, down the bowl.
[2541.10s -> 2545.58s]  Get it all with the truck. Didn't work.
[2545.58s -> 2554.47s]  Top right of the screen is me.
[2554.47s -> 2556.47s]  I know, I know!
[2556.47s -> 2558.47s]  It's not though, it's this guy.
[2558.47s -> 2565.77s]  I always remember looking at the chat and the game at the same time.
[2565.77s -> 2567.77s]  You were right here!
[2567.77s -> 2571.67s]  Good throw.
[2571.67s -> 2592.02s]  Nice. Look at me, look at me.
[2592.02s -> 2594.02s]  Jervis Grumpy.
[2594.02s -> 2597.22s]  What? I'm not Grumpy, what are you talking about?
[2597.22s -> 2611.69s]  He's pissed, I'm not pissed, I'm happy.
[2613.69s -> 2615.69s]  Playing hold, ultimate destruction for the week.
[2615.69s -> 2617.69s]  How could I not be happy?
[2617.69s -> 2626.14s]  You know, give me, give me one of these.
[2626.14s -> 2630.42s]  Hit him in the fucking skull.
[2630.42s -> 2634.14s]  How could you not like it?
[2634.14s -> 2639.32s]  This isn't ultimate destruction, I know.
[2639.32s -> 2644.78s]  Alright, on a scale of one to ten, how much better of a game is ultimate destruction than licensed Hulk video games?
[2644.78s -> 2646.78s]  Ten.
[2646.78s -> 2655.02s]  Ten.
[2655.02s -> 2658.15s]  Oh wait, this one came out, this is the newer one.
[2658.15s -> 2660.15s]  Why is this one not as good?
[2660.15s -> 2662.15s]  Watch the trailer, nope.
[2662.15s -> 2666.89s]  I want to go in blind, completely blind.
[2666.89s -> 2669.06s]  I don't want to see a single thing.
[2669.06s -> 2671.30s]  This was a cash grab.
[2674.31s -> 2679.82s]  This is bootleg tie-in.
[2679.82s -> 2681.82s]  Bootleg license tie-in.
[2681.82s -> 2683.82s]  What else is over here?
[2683.82s -> 2689.24s]  What else is over here?
[2689.24s -> 2691.24s]  Oh, I have to break the door?
[2691.24s -> 2693.48s]  Is it the door?
[2693.48s -> 2695.85s]  Or is it just break the building?
[2695.85s -> 2699.18s]  This looks like a Minecraft creative level.
[2701.93s -> 2703.93s]  It does not look like that.
[2703.93s -> 2711.16s]  It actually kind of does.
[2711.16s -> 2715.45s]  It actually kind of does.
[2715.45s -> 2719.10s]  How come I can't do anything?
[2719.10s -> 2730.60s]  Oh.
[2748.46s -> 2755.50s]  Cause I destroyed it.
[2755.50s -> 2758.06s]  Ultimate destruction even looks better.
[2758.06s -> 2767.27s]  Really?
[2767.27s -> 2769.27s]  That scared the shit out of me.
[2769.27s -> 2780.09s]  I thought that was like somebody outside my window for a second.
[2780.09s -> 2782.09s]  Like I just heard it down here.
[2782.09s -> 2784.09s]  Like listen, like
[2784.09s -> 2786.39s]  Like somebody here in the house.
[2786.39s -> 2797.90s]  What's the next mission?
[2797.90s -> 2800.71s]  That sounds like Woody from Toy Story.
[2808.20s -> 2816.01s]  Help! Buzz!
[2816.01s -> 2820.74s]  How do you put somebody down?
[2820.74s -> 2822.74s]  I want to hear that. You're violating!
[2822.74s -> 2826.90s]  That actually does sound like Woody.
[2826.90s -> 2828.90s]  That could be like a Buzz Lightyear.
[2828.90s -> 2830.90s]  It sounds like Buzz Lightyear more than Woody.
[2833.78s -> 2843.00s]  How do I put people down?
[2843.00s -> 2845.00s]  I think they're going to be okay.
[2845.00s -> 2850.76s]  They're okay.
[2850.76s -> 2852.76s]  Holy shit.
[2852.76s -> 2854.76s]  That was like a super choke slam.
[2854.76s -> 2864.10s]  Alright, I'm going to do one more mission
[2864.10s -> 2866.10s]  in a Hulk tie-in movie game.
[2866.10s -> 2868.10s]  And then I'm going to
[2868.10s -> 2870.10s]  play the actual one
[2870.10s -> 2875.35s]  cause this is the wrong game.
[2875.35s -> 2877.35s]  But I feel like
[2877.35s -> 2879.35s]  we got some value from this.
[2879.35s -> 2881.35s]  I'm happy that I got to play this.
[2885.83s -> 2887.83s]  I'm very happy about this.
[2887.83s -> 2898.31s]  Alright, last mission.
[2898.31s -> 2900.31s]  How much did I pay?
[2900.31s -> 2902.31s]  I don't think this is more than like five dollars.
[2902.31s -> 2904.81s]  This is probably like six and a half dollars.
[2904.81s -> 2911.72s]  Maybe.
[2911.72s -> 2914.98s]  Choke slam somebody from the tallest building.
[2926.23s -> 2928.23s]  I can't. I don't think I can do that.
[2928.23s -> 2930.73s]  I have to jump there.
[2930.73s -> 2934.31s]  Choke slam from the highest possible place.
[2934.31s -> 2936.31s]  Cause I can't climb.
[2936.31s -> 2941.11s]  Alright, I can go from here to here.
[2941.11s -> 2944.89s]  Right here.
[2944.89s -> 2947.13s]  There.
[2947.13s -> 2953.72s]  We can jump up here.
[2953.72s -> 2955.72s]  And then I can go over this way.
[2955.72s -> 2958.66s]  Up to that building.
[2958.66s -> 2964.94s]  Okay.
[2964.94s -> 2968.65s]  Up here.
[2968.65s -> 2972.42s]  Any other buildings I can do?
[2972.42s -> 2977.93s]  Can I get up on this one?
[2977.93s -> 2983.22s]  Over there?
[2983.22s -> 2985.91s]  Might be too far.
[2985.91s -> 2991.03s]  I think it's too far to get over there.
[2991.03s -> 2997.82s]  It's not. Let's see.
[2997.82s -> 3005.94s]  No, over there.
[3005.94s -> 3022.06s]  Over here.
[3022.06s -> 3024.06s]  Rotate the camera a little bit.
[3024.06s -> 3026.06s]  How about this way?
[3026.06s -> 3031.82s]  I think this is as good as it's going to get.
[3031.82s -> 3041.80s]  Okay, we need a good spot.
[3041.80s -> 3043.80s]  That I can go all the way to the ground.
[3043.80s -> 3054.42s]  That was an elbow drop.
[3054.42s -> 3059.24s]  That was a full on landing with the elbow in his chest.
[3059.24s -> 3100.97s]  I broke his arm.
[3100.97s -> 3114.97s]  Still alive? Wow.
[3114.97s -> 3117.66s]  Didn't kill him. He's still alive.
[3118.66s -> 3137.06s]  Line up. This will kill him.
[3137.06s -> 3151.71s]  Holy shit.
[3151.71s -> 3153.71s]  Did I gamma ray this guy from the top rope?
[3153.71s -> 3159.20s]  He's invincible.
[3159.20s -> 3177.50s]  He's actually unkillable.
[3177.50s -> 3179.50s]  I knocked him over.
[3179.50s -> 3181.68s]  What if I run him over with a car?
[3181.68s -> 3199.92s]  That was brutal.
[3209.61s -> 3222.71s]  Stay right here for a second.
[3222.71s -> 3243.26s]  The cops?
[3243.26s -> 3251.05s]  He's still alive. He's still good.
[3251.05s -> 3258.41s]  How do I kill him?
[3258.41s -> 3263.40s]  That's it.
[3263.40s -> 3271.66s]  Here, punch this guy.
[3271.66s -> 3283.18s]  You can't do it either.
[3283.18s -> 3287.98s]  Throw him into the ocean.
[3287.98s -> 3289.98s]  You want me to throw him in the ocean?
[3289.98s -> 3292.34s]  I'm going to throw him in the ocean.
[3292.34s -> 3306.94s]  I was supposed to do a mission.
[3306.94s -> 3316.46s]  Ocean.
[3316.46s -> 3318.95s]  You're not coming back from this one.
[3318.95s -> 3321.13s]  Not a chance at health.
[3321.13s -> 3355.35s]  Definitely dead.
[3355.35s -> 3363.10s]  The game automatically does this to you.
[3363.10s -> 3375.83s]  He's dead.
[3375.83s -> 3384.09s]  Last mission.
[3384.09s -> 3390.34s]  He will return.
[3390.34s -> 3392.34s]  It's the same model.
[3392.34s -> 3394.34s]  It's the same model.
[3394.34s -> 3400.23s]  Let's go.
[3400.23s -> 3407.78s]  Final mission.
[3407.78s -> 3418.47s]  It was a GMod map.
[3418.47s -> 3423.46s]  GM city.
[3423.46s -> 3425.46s]  I took a shower and you're being psycho.
[3428.41s -> 3430.41s]  What did I do?
[3430.41s -> 3436.47s]  It really is big city.
[3438.47s -> 3440.47s]  Big city in GMod.
[3440.47s -> 3450.71s]  I can stand on them?
[3450.71s -> 3452.71s]  I can stand on cars.
[3452.71s -> 3455.02s]  This is important.
[3455.02s -> 3464.23s]  I can stand on shit.
[3464.23s -> 3466.23s]  I'm trying to get you to...
[3466.23s -> 3468.23s]  I need to make a traffic jam.
[3468.23s -> 3470.23s]  I want you to bump into each other.
[3470.23s -> 3478.10s]  Very gently and explode.
[3478.10s -> 3485.34s]  It's possible.
[3485.34s -> 3497.35s]  Let me save you here.
[3497.35s -> 3500.68s]  Get on the bus.
[3500.68s -> 3504.58s]  Just throw this and get on him.
[3504.58s -> 3506.58s]  I'm the Hulk. Of course it's going to break.
[3514.20s -> 3517.66s]  The Bachelor.
[3517.66s -> 3520.34s]  Quit streaming.
[3526.82s -> 3532.14s]  Nice flip phone, Bruce.
[3532.14s -> 3534.14s]  This is like 2003.
[3548.90s -> 3553.70s]  I'm right here, dude.
[3553.70s -> 3555.70s]  You're in a tank?
[3555.70s -> 3558.33s]  You need backup and you're in a tank.
[3562.63s -> 3581.32s]  Watch out for the cabs.
[3581.32s -> 3583.32s]  Whatever his name is.
[3585.32s -> 3587.32s]  Why was this a 3D movie?
[3598.46s -> 3602.74s]  Nice.
[3602.74s -> 3604.74s]  Perfect.
[3604.74s -> 3606.74s]  A railroad spike. Whatever it is.
[3606.74s -> 3618.33s]  A railroad stick.
[3618.33s -> 3620.33s]  Not that powerful, actually.
[3620.33s -> 3625.00s]  No!
[3625.00s -> 3630.12s]  I needed that bus.
[3630.12s -> 3647.00s]  Any more buses?
[3647.00s -> 3649.00s]  These things are so fragile.
[3649.00s -> 3651.43s]  They're blowing up in my hands.
[3651.43s -> 3653.43s]  They made it a paper mache.
[3653.43s -> 3659.88s]  I didn't do anything.
[3659.88s -> 3661.88s]  They made it a thin glass.
[3661.88s -> 3670.58s]  That one's still driving.
[3670.58s -> 3674.23s]  Alright, look for a bus.
[3674.23s -> 3681.40s]  That's all I care about.
[3681.40s -> 3683.40s]  Throw a truck in the air and then shoot it in the air with a car.
[3707.70s -> 3712.76s]  No!
[3712.76s -> 3722.17s]  You can't get these guys away from me.
[3722.17s -> 3727.59s]  Oh, my head.
[3727.59s -> 3730.22s]  That was like waking up
[3730.22s -> 3732.22s]  really early when you're on the top bunk
[3732.22s -> 3734.22s]  and you smash your head on the ceiling.
[3734.22s -> 3736.22s]  You guys have that problem?
[3736.22s -> 3754.31s]  Alright, I'm jumping.
[3754.31s -> 3764.87s]  Fox, get these guys off me.
[3764.87s -> 3769.86s]  I'm coming, Slippy.
[3769.86s -> 3782.60s]  I didn't even want to pick you up.
[3784.60s -> 3788.25s]  Everybody's Elmo.
[3788.25s -> 3790.25s]  Every character is Elmo.
[3790.25s -> 3792.25s]  Every single character is Elmo.
[3792.25s -> 3806.33s]  Don't you guys know that by now?
[3806.33s -> 3815.61s]  Bus. I need a bus.
[3815.61s -> 3817.61s]  I need a bus.
[3817.61s -> 3835.72s]  Good.
[3835.72s -> 3840.95s]  I'm coming.
[3840.95s -> 3842.95s]  What do you think I'm doing?
[3842.95s -> 3845.77s]  It's over. We win.
[3845.77s -> 3849.61s]  My eyes flashed.
[3849.61s -> 3852.55s]  Okay, bus.
[3852.55s -> 3856.58s]  Still alive.
[3856.58s -> 3867.34s]  Still alive.
[3867.34s -> 3869.34s]  Alright, let's move.
[3869.34s -> 3871.34s]  Go into the subway.
[3871.34s -> 3875.24s]  Go into the subway
[3875.24s -> 3877.24s]  is probably the idea.
[3877.24s -> 3884.33s]  My ear is itchy.
[3884.33s -> 3889.19s]  Try to break the game.
[3889.19s -> 3901.80s]  Well, I care about throwing a bus
[3901.80s -> 3903.80s]  into the ocean, so
[3903.80s -> 3905.80s]  I mean, that's a given.
[3905.80s -> 3915.85s]  This mission is long.
[3927.71s -> 3929.71s]  That's not a bad guy.
[3934.53s -> 3938.24s]  Die!
[3938.24s -> 3940.24s]  All the way down here. Get out of here.
[3940.24s -> 3942.24s]  Where the fuck are these super mutants
[3942.24s -> 3946.72s]  even coming from?
[3946.72s -> 3948.72s]  That guy just fucked himself up.
[3952.14s -> 3955.78s]  He's dead. He's dead.
[3955.78s -> 3960.71s]  Why did he turn into
[3960.71s -> 3962.71s]  seven other smaller
[3962.71s -> 3986.07s]  cars? That guy was driving
[3986.07s -> 3988.07s]  backwards faster than you could
[3988.07s -> 3993.32s]  drive forwards.
[3993.32s -> 4041.77s]  There's so many cabs.
[4041.77s -> 4043.77s]  Now we can fucking stop.
[4043.77s -> 4049.66s]  What do we got? Six hours?
[4049.66s -> 4068.60s]  Not sure when I could start right now
[4068.60s -> 4070.60s]  that wouldn't take at least four hours.
[4070.60s -> 4099.19s]  Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
[4099.19s -> 4107.51s]  I'll see you tomorrow. And then I'll see you Sunday too.
[4107.51s -> 4115.88s]  What are we doing tomorrow?
[4115.88s -> 4118.25s]  That's a really good...I kind of need to look at what
[4118.25s -> 4120.25s]  I need to...I have to look at what I have.
[4120.25s -> 4122.81s]  Wait, this is a new big thing to grab.
[4122.81s -> 4127.80s]  I need to look at what I got.
[4127.80s -> 4129.80s]  A real wink? It's been a while since we had one.
[4129.80s -> 4134.92s]  Community content night is Sunday.
[4134.92s -> 4137.42s]  We'll be live tomorrow.
[4137.42s -> 4139.42s]  And then...I want to do
[4139.42s -> 4141.42s]  something I can do in one stream.
[4141.42s -> 4143.42s]  I don't know if I want to do...I think I want to move away from like the
[4143.42s -> 4148.41s]  GUI in the GameCube for a little while.
[4148.41s -> 4150.41s]  I have a lot of stuff. So I gotta figure out
[4150.41s -> 4160.58s]  what I want to do. Hulk.
[4160.58s -> 4162.95s]  Well, the good one
[4162.95s -> 4164.95s]  won't be here for at least a couple days.
[4164.95s -> 4169.37s]  Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[4169.37s -> 4171.37s]  We'll do something. And then
[4171.37s -> 4173.37s]  the community content night is Sunday.
[4173.37s -> 4175.37s]  Also the last day for winks. We're gonna do
[4175.37s -> 4177.37s]  a wink apocalypse.
[4177.37s -> 4180.06s]  So, we'll see you tomorrow.
[4180.06s -> 4193.56s]  Putting the Wiimote down.
[4193.56s -> 4198.34s]  Wink. I got it.
[4198.34s -> 4200.58s]  Putting down the Wiimote. And we're gonna end
[4200.58s -> 4203.21s]  the stream here. I'm gonna stick around. We'll do the bits
[4203.21s -> 4205.38s]  and everything. We'll hang out. But
[4205.38s -> 4208.01s]  reliably, it's
[4208.01s -> 4210.01s]  not very much I think I would want to start that
[4210.01s -> 4212.01s]  would take less than 30 to 40 minutes.
[4212.01s -> 4214.01s]  And if we're gonna do that anyways, if I'm just gonna
[4214.01s -> 4216.01s]  stream for like 31 minutes, might as well just do
[4216.01s -> 4218.01s]  the 30 to 40 minute end of the stream.
[4218.01s -> 4220.38s]  And start fresh tomorrow
[4220.38s -> 4222.38s]  I'm gonna do something that can take
[4222.38s -> 4227.56s]  6 plus hours to do.
[4227.56s -> 4229.56s]  Did I finish Mario Sunshine?
[4229.56s -> 4233.14s]  I did. Play Mario Odyssey.
[4233.14s -> 4236.90s]  I probably will.
[4236.90s -> 4241.90s]  I probably will. Well, thanks for joining me.
[4241.90s -> 4249.43s]  I'll see you tomorrow. Take care guys.
[4249.43s -> 4255.58s]  Get the music going.
[4255.58s -> 4262.30s]  Turn it up a little bit.
[4262.30s -> 4264.30s]  Do a Frogger stream.
[4264.30s -> 4267.69s]  Remember, if you just sit there
[4267.69s -> 4269.69s]  motionless for 16 hours, why don't you
[4269.69s -> 4273.27s]  just keep the cam on?
[4273.27s -> 4275.27s]  Yeah, just keep the camera on.
[4275.27s -> 4279.56s]  Stream 24x7.
[4279.56s -> 4281.93s]  But let's go back to earlier.
[4281.93s -> 4283.93s]  We had 5 community subs from Never
[4283.93s -> 4285.93s]  Trust Nanners. I think that was before the stream even
[4285.93s -> 4288.62s]  started. So thanks for that.
[4288.62s -> 4292.33s]  Bulbaswag, thanks for the 500 bits.
[4292.33s -> 4294.33s]  I'm so happy I got to derail with
[4294.33s -> 4296.33s]  this neat glitch.
[4296.33s -> 4298.33s]  Yeah, that was at least
[4298.33s -> 4300.89s]  30 to 40 minutes
[4300.89s -> 4303.13s]  of stream time. Was that
[4303.13s -> 4305.94s]  whole scenario.
[4305.94s -> 4307.94s]  And I didn't even use it. Just did it the regular way.
[4307.94s -> 4314.73s]  I'm going to buy Hulk Ultimate
[4314.73s -> 4317.16s]  Destruction and get it here as soon as
[4317.16s -> 4320.04s]  possible. Don't worry.
[4320.04s -> 4322.54s]  If I bought the wrong game, I'd make mistakes.
[4322.54s -> 4325.10s]  It's okay.
[4325.10s -> 4327.10s]  Jaxx with a bunch of X's thanks for the 500
[4327.10s -> 4329.10s]  bits. Jeremy, long time listener, first time caller.
[4329.10s -> 4331.10s]  Hope I did this right. Thanks for doing the Mario.
[4331.10s -> 4333.34s]  It was really fun.
[4333.34s -> 4335.83s]  Glad I finally got to experience
[4335.83s -> 4339.35s]  the
[4339.35s -> 4341.35s]  mainline Mario game
[4341.35s -> 4343.35s]  for the Gamecube. I didn't play it.
[4343.35s -> 4349.22s]  Thanks a lot. Cold Warhol
[4349.22s -> 4351.22s]  gave $20, 2000 bits
[4351.22s -> 4353.59s]  from Cold Warhol. Thanks for the 20 bucks.
[4353.59s -> 4356.15s]  Appreciate it. Howdy, Jeremy. Hope you're doing
[4356.15s -> 4358.15s]  well. Today's my 21st birthday, which means I'm
[4358.15s -> 4360.15s]  finally legally old enough to watch your streams.
[4360.15s -> 4362.15s]  Here's some of that birthday
[4362.15s -> 4364.15s]  card money for your own, for
[4364.15s -> 4367.93s]  your e-clown services.
[4367.93s -> 4369.93s]  Our rated movie is 17, isn't it?
[4369.93s -> 4379.64s]  What is PG-13?
[4379.64s -> 4381.64s]  What if PG-13 was 16 or something?
[4381.64s -> 4391.05s]  That would make no sense. It would just be PG-16.
[4391.05s -> 4395.02s]  But happy birthday,
[4395.02s -> 4397.02s]  Cold Warhol. Thanks for the 20 bucks.
[4397.02s -> 4405.32s]  Appreciate it. Peaceful
[4405.32s -> 4407.32s]  Haley. Thanks for the 250, Jeremy. Hope you liked
[4407.32s -> 4409.32s]  the game so far. I was wondering, which are your favorite
[4409.32s -> 4411.32s]  worlds, so far at least?
[4411.32s -> 4413.32s]  Mine is Serena Beach.
[4413.32s -> 4415.32s]  My least favorite is probably Noki Bay
[4415.32s -> 4417.32s]  because it gets annoying. Also, yeah, the only
[4417.32s -> 4419.32s]  complaint I have on this game is the camera.
[4419.32s -> 4421.32s]  The best world
[4421.32s -> 4423.32s]  in Mario Sunshine was
[4423.32s -> 4429.78s]  I think I like that
[4429.78s -> 4435.29s]  first world. Either the first
[4435.29s -> 4437.29s]  world or
[4437.29s -> 4441.70s]  yeah, probably the first world.
[4441.70s -> 4443.70s]  That first introduction world I think is really
[4443.70s -> 4446.46s]  nice. I like the
[4446.46s -> 4448.46s]  lake. I like the big windmill.
[4448.46s -> 4450.46s]  That's probably where I would like the most.
[4450.46s -> 4452.46s]  Bianco Hills, yeah.
[4452.46s -> 4456.81s]  That one reminded me the most of
[4456.81s -> 4458.81s]  Mario 64.
[4458.81s -> 4460.81s]  It was a very Mario 64-esque
[4460.81s -> 4467.78s]  level.
[4467.78s -> 4469.78s]  Are you excited for Resident Evil 3? Yep. I mean, Resident Evil 2
[4469.78s -> 4471.78s]  I thought was the best game that came out last year, so I
[4471.78s -> 4473.78s]  definitely can't wait for the next in
[4473.78s -> 4483.26s]  the series to be remade. What about
[4483.26s -> 4485.26s]  the Chalksters? Oh, that wasn't a world.
[4485.26s -> 4487.26s]  That was a secret level.
[4487.26s -> 4491.99s]  Thanks a lot, Haley. I thought it was
[4491.99s -> 4494.49s]  great. We had five
[4494.49s -> 4496.49s]  community subs from Oath Horse and
[4496.49s -> 4498.49s]  2,000 bits
[4498.49s -> 4500.98s]  from Oath Horse as well.
[4500.98s -> 4502.98s]  So thank you, Oath Horse, for your $20 and
[4502.98s -> 4506.06s]  five community subs. Back
[4506.06s -> 4508.06s]  to back. And they say awesome Mario
[4508.06s -> 4510.06s]  streams when my daughter had introduced
[4510.06s -> 4512.06s]  me to you and your content was a baby.
[4512.06s -> 4514.06s]  She watched her cousin playing
[4514.06s -> 4516.06s]  this game and when he collected a shine
[4516.06s -> 4518.06s]  she threw up her
[4518.06s -> 4520.06s]  fat baby arms and yelled
[4520.06s -> 4522.06s]  Woo Cha Chao.
[4522.06s -> 4524.36s]  It's a family
[4524.36s -> 4528.20s]  meme to this day.
[4528.20s -> 4531.85s]  Woo Cha Chao. If you get a
[4531.85s -> 4533.85s]  chance, our family would love to hear one from
[4533.85s -> 4538.46s]  you. Woo Cha Chao.
[4538.46s -> 4541.90s]  Did I do it right?
[4541.90s -> 4543.90s]  This is a sitcom plot line.
[4543.90s -> 4551.96s]  Nobody does better
[4551.96s -> 4553.96s]  gaming-related improv and sketch comedy
[4553.96s -> 4555.96s]  than you do. That's very nice of you.
[4555.96s -> 4559.03s]  Huge fans and love your content.
[4559.03s -> 4561.03s]  I told you there was kids watching. That's why
[4561.03s -> 4564.04s]  I had to be careful today.
[4564.04s -> 4566.04s]  I tried to not swear as much, but I
[4566.04s -> 4568.04s]  think I've removed
[4568.04s -> 4570.86s]  two or three swears today.
[4570.86s -> 4572.86s]  If I typically swear four to five thousand
[4572.86s -> 4574.86s]  times a stream, I took
[4574.86s -> 4576.86s]  maybe
[4576.86s -> 4579.16s]  0.2%. I'm not a kid.
[4579.16s -> 4581.16s]  You're not a kid, but
[4581.16s -> 4583.16s]  kids probably watching. There were kids potentially
[4583.16s -> 4595.83s]  in the audience.
[4595.83s -> 4597.83s]  But thanks for the
[4597.83s -> 4599.83s]  big drop and the community subs.
[4599.83s -> 4602.39s]  Appreciate that. Thank you.
[4602.39s -> 4604.39s]  Captain Sharkbait gave five community
[4604.39s -> 4606.39s]  subs, but the difference between these five
[4606.39s -> 4608.39s]  community subs and
[4608.39s -> 4610.39s]  standard community subs is these five
[4610.39s -> 4612.89s]  were tier three. They gave
[4612.89s -> 4614.89s]  five tier three community
[4614.89s -> 4616.89s]  subs, which are $25
[4616.89s -> 4619.38s]  each. Aren't they?
[4619.38s -> 4621.38s]  How much are they? $24.99, right?
[4621.38s -> 4624.26s]  Wait, how much are they?
[4624.26s -> 4632.12s]  Okay, that's expensive.
[4632.12s -> 4634.12s]  Five tier three subs.
[4634.12s -> 4636.94s]  That's $125 in subs.
[4636.94s -> 4640.07s]  So that's insane.
[4640.07s -> 4645.56s]  Thank you, Captain Sharkbait.
[4645.56s -> 4647.56s]  There's not even a tier three emote.
[4647.56s -> 4650.31s]  Do I still have 10k subs? No, I do
[4650.31s -> 4655.69s]  not. Hitting it and crossing it
[4655.69s -> 4657.69s]  was a fucking crazy thing.
[4657.69s -> 4661.72s]  I could never expect
[4661.72s -> 4663.72s]  to keep 10,000
[4663.72s -> 4665.72s]  fucking subs on this channel.
[4665.72s -> 4667.72s]  That is an unbelievable
[4667.72s -> 4670.22s]  number.
[4670.22s -> 4672.97s]  That's alright.
[4672.97s -> 4683.34s]  That does not bother me.
[4683.34s -> 4685.34s]  But thank you, Captain Sharkbait, for your
[4685.34s -> 4687.34s]  ridiculous tier three subs.
[4687.34s -> 4689.34s]  Hoj, fast thanks for the 500 bits. They just
[4689.34s -> 4691.34s]  say hype. I must have done something
[4691.34s -> 4693.34s]  cool. Thank you, HojFest.
[4693.34s -> 4696.73s]  SticksRenegade250
[4696.73s -> 4698.73s]  HeyiiGerma, I'm five.
[4698.73s -> 4700.73s]  What's a 69?
[4700.73s -> 4708.07s]  It's
[4708.07s -> 4710.07s]  a 69 is
[4710.07s -> 4712.07s]  the way to write out
[4712.07s -> 4714.07s]  how a battery connects.
[4714.07s -> 4718.17s]  How some of your devices work.
[4718.17s -> 4720.17s]  That's what they mean. That's why they think it's a cool number.
[4720.17s -> 4737.58s]  Thanks for the 250, just in case you're curious.
[4737.58s -> 4739.58s]  BraptonB
[4739.58s -> 4741.58s]  Thanks for the five community subs, Brapton.
[4741.58s -> 4743.88s]  Earlier today.
[4743.88s -> 4746.18s]  WembleyTTV
[4746.18s -> 4749.30s]  250
[4749.30s -> 4751.30s]  Hey, Germa, I took into account
[4751.30s -> 4753.30s]  what you said.
[4753.30s -> 4755.30s]  I did dream about you and Spongebob crossing swords.
[4755.30s -> 4757.30s]  You made it even worse.
[4757.30s -> 4759.30s]  I still got you naked with
[4759.30s -> 4761.30s]  Defoe while you and Spongebob
[4761.30s -> 4763.30s]  you know, nevermind that. Thanks for the help.
[4763.30s -> 4765.86s]  What? I still got
[4765.86s -> 4769.38s]  naked?
[4769.38s -> 4780.84s]  Why are we naked? Wait.
[4780.84s -> 4782.84s]  PeacefulHailey, thanks for the 250. Germa, please let
[4782.84s -> 4785.78s]  me simp you.
[4785.78s -> 4791.03s]  What does that mean?
[4791.03s -> 4802.04s]  What does that mean? Turn the stream
[4802.04s -> 4806.46s]  off now.
[4806.46s -> 4808.46s]  Thank you. I don't
[4808.46s -> 4813.26s]  know what that is. KeithKingKrimz
[4813.26s -> 4815.26s]  Thanks for the 250. Hey, Germa, this is Keith.
[4815.26s -> 4817.26s]  The NPC from The Bachelor. I deserved
[4817.26s -> 4819.26s]  that rose, not you, fucker.
[4819.26s -> 4822.20s]  Well, you didn't get enough hearts.
[4822.20s -> 4827.77s]  I did.
[4827.77s -> 4829.77s]  YharnamTouristShop, thanks for the
[4829.77s -> 4831.77s]  300 bits.
[4831.77s -> 4833.77s]  Germa, how much do I have to pay you to stop playing
[4833.77s -> 4835.77s]  this bachelor game and come beat
[4835.77s -> 4837.77s]  Orphan of Kos
[4837.77s -> 4839.77s]  with me? Name your price.
[4839.77s -> 4842.39s]  Oh, there is
[4842.39s -> 4844.39s]  none. Price is
[4844.39s -> 4846.39s]  n-slash-a, not applicable.
[4846.39s -> 4856.63s]  Hey, many rabbits, thanks for the 300
[4856.63s -> 4858.63s]  bits. In the span of about three weeks, I lost my job
[4858.63s -> 4860.63s]  and now I'm losing my home. That's
[4860.63s -> 4863.26s]  terrible. Sorry to hear
[4863.26s -> 4865.56s]  that. Meanwhile, I'm watching your
[4865.56s -> 4867.56s]  JumpKingBots and there's something kind of therapeutic
[4867.56s -> 4869.56s]  about watching you fail so intensely
[4869.56s -> 4871.56s]  over and over again while I'm dealing with this.
[4871.56s -> 4875.72s]  Love you, 5ever.
[4875.72s -> 4877.72s]  I don't know your exact scenario, but that's
[4877.72s -> 4880.86s]  that sounds fucking horrible.
[4880.86s -> 4883.99s]  Hopefully you get that figured out.
[4883.99s -> 4891.22s]  I cannot imagine something like that happening.
[4891.22s -> 4899.22s]  Yeah, hope everything turns out
[4899.22s -> 4908.44s]  okay. Thanks for the $3
[4908.44s -> 4919.11s]  and good luck.
[4919.11s -> 4921.11s]  We also had TheManWithTheBabyHands
[4921.11s -> 4924.50s]  for 1000 bits
[4924.50s -> 4926.50s]  $10 teddy bear streamer
[4926.50s -> 4929.38s]  No, I'm not a teddy bear. I'm not a teddy bear.
[4929.38s -> 4938.90s]  Let me tell you, I'm a bull.
[4938.90s -> 4940.90s]  What's the world's sleepiest animal?
[4940.90s -> 4946.22s]  Okay, for like one hour a day
[4946.22s -> 4949.48s]  I'm a bull.
[4949.48s -> 4951.48s]  And then for 23 more hours I'm a koala.
[4951.48s -> 4954.04s]  That's like
[4954.04s -> 4956.41s]  two to three hours I'm a bull.
[4956.41s -> 4958.41s]  For 22 to 21 hours a day
[4958.41s -> 4961.16s]  I'm a koala. What does that make me?
[4961.16s -> 4973.51s]  An idiot.
[4973.51s -> 4977.61s]  Hey
[4977.61s -> 4979.61s]  Lazy Luke, thanks for the 250.
[4979.61s -> 4981.61s]  Last stream we talked about something like this.
[4981.61s -> 4983.61s]  So I made a page which randomly
[4983.61s -> 4985.61s]  picks a moment out of about
[4985.61s -> 4987.61s]  3200 hours of archived streams
[4987.61s -> 4989.61s]  and main channeled videos.
[4989.61s -> 4991.61s]  Are you kidding me? You did this in one day?
[4991.61s -> 4993.61s]  Click the button at the top
[4993.61s -> 4995.61s]  center to play a random moment out of
[4995.61s -> 4997.61s]  3200 hours of Jerma videos
[4997.61s -> 5000.62s]  and streams.
[5000.62s -> 5002.62s]  You fucking legend.
[5002.62s -> 5004.62s]  You are legendary. Are you serious?
[5004.62s -> 5006.92s]  You actually did this?
[5006.92s -> 5014.92s]  Oh my god.
[5014.92s -> 5018.31s]  Unfucking believable.
[5018.31s -> 5021.77s]  It works. This is
[5021.77s -> 5024.14s]  unbelievable. This is amazing.
[5024.14s -> 5029.45s]  Holy shit.
[5029.45s -> 5031.94s]  Well, okay.
[5031.94s -> 5033.94s]  So for those that have need context here
[5033.94s -> 5036.50s]  talked about how funny it would be
[5036.50s -> 5038.50s]  on a stream if
[5038.50s -> 5040.94s]  we took every
[5040.94s -> 5042.94s]  stream I've ever done.
[5042.94s -> 5044.94s]  Or at least the ones that are available.
[5044.94s -> 5046.94s]  The archive channel has 80
[5046.94s -> 5048.94s]  to 90% or so of every
[5048.94s -> 5051.56s]  stream I've ever done. And every
[5051.56s -> 5054.18s]  10 minutes we change
[5054.18s -> 5056.18s]  to a random stream
[5056.18s -> 5058.18s]  at a random time. And watch
[5058.18s -> 5068.04s]  for 10 minutes and see what happens.
[5068.04s -> 5075.14s]  That would be pretty fun.
[5075.14s -> 5077.90s]  Compact duration.
[5077.90s -> 5079.90s]  Do that tomorrow.
[5079.90s -> 5081.90s]  I mean, it's
[5081.90s -> 5086.57s]  ready to use.
[5086.57s -> 5088.57s]  That's unbelievable. I did not think
[5088.57s -> 5090.57s]  this was going to be ready to use as of now.
[5090.57s -> 5096.14s]  Easy content.
[5096.14s -> 5098.14s]  Easy content.
[5098.14s -> 5100.70s]  Hold on. Let me think about this.
[5100.70s -> 5104.86s]  Do it now. No, no, no, no, no.
[5104.86s -> 5106.86s]  We have to sit there. We have to be ready for this.
[5106.86s -> 5108.86s]  I don't want to do one right now.
[5108.86s -> 5114.49s]  I don't want to give that away.
[5114.49s -> 5119.93s]  Lazy Luke. Holy shit.
[5119.93s -> 5121.93s]  Lazy Luke, what's your Discord name? What's your name on Discord?
[5121.93s -> 5125.06s]  Are you using Lazy Luke
[5125.06s -> 5127.06s]  on Discord?
[5127.06s -> 5137.94s]  Do I have you on Discord?
[5137.94s -> 5139.94s]  Alright, somebody get a hold of that guy.
[5139.94s -> 5141.94s]  One of the mods. Get a hold of Lazy Luke.
[5141.94s -> 5143.94s]  I want to talk to Lazy Luke.
[5143.94s -> 5148.68s]  One on one.
[5148.68s -> 5150.68s]  What? No, I...
[5150.68s -> 5155.54s]  No! And I'll tell you a couple of reasons
[5155.54s -> 5158.17s]  why. First,
[5158.17s -> 5160.17s]  very importantly,
[5160.17s -> 5162.17s]  Lazy Luke has made
[5162.17s -> 5164.17s]  a better stream dashboard
[5164.17s -> 5167.35s]  than all the ones
[5167.35s -> 5172.54s]  that are currently available.
[5172.54s -> 5174.78s]  It's five times better than Streamlabs.
[5174.78s -> 5179.77s]  And they've also
[5179.77s -> 5181.77s]  got a couple of the little website things.
[5181.77s -> 5183.77s]  I want to have a couple
[5183.77s -> 5185.77s]  of words with Lazy Luke
[5185.77s -> 5194.02s]  about some stuff. Yeah, I mean,
[5194.02s -> 5200.04s]  we're doing this too.
[5200.04s -> 5204.65s]  This sounds ominous.
[5204.65s -> 5206.65s]  Ominous.
[5206.65s -> 5208.65s]  What's their exact username?
[5208.65s -> 5221.45s]  They sent their info. Okay, cool.
[5221.45s -> 5227.19s]  There we go.
[5227.19s -> 5229.19s]  The newest VIP of the channel is Lazy Luke.
[5229.19s -> 5232.71s]  I mean, this is so good.
[5232.71s -> 5234.71s]  We talked about this
[5234.71s -> 5238.04s]  just off the cuff.
[5238.04s -> 5240.04s]  Randomly. Yesterday.
[5240.04s -> 5242.04s]  And it's already done and ready to be used?
[5242.04s -> 5244.04s]  That's unfucking believable.
[5244.04s -> 5246.04s]  Talk to me on Discord. We've got some stuff to talk about.
[5246.04s -> 5256.46s]  I'll put you up in the next day or two.
[5256.46s -> 5259.14s]  Anyways, we have...
[5259.14s -> 5269.05s]  Where are we?
[5269.05s -> 5271.05s]  We have Leroy Brown for $5.
[5271.05s -> 5273.05s]  Jerma, this stream has been amazing.
[5273.05s -> 5275.05s]  I love this stream so much that I made a JPG
[5275.05s -> 5279.72s]  to remember it by.
[5279.72s -> 5288.49s]  Wait, why am I green?
[5288.49s -> 5300.46s]  Why am I green in this picture?
[5300.46s -> 5309.10s]  Can you see it? Wait, what's going on?
[5309.10s -> 5315.56s]  Oh, sorry.
[5315.56s -> 5320.42s]  Oh, cause the Hulk.
[5320.42s -> 5322.42s]  Alright. What am I thinking of the
[5322.42s -> 5332.73s]  slide level?
[5332.73s -> 5334.73s]  He thought I was a Teletubby.
[5334.73s -> 5336.73s]  Thank you
[5336.73s -> 5338.90s]  for the $5 Leroy. Appreciate it.
[5338.90s -> 5340.90s]  Zaru, thanks for the 300 bits.
[5340.90s -> 5342.90s]  My friends and I occasionally play Happy Rock.
[5342.90s -> 5344.90s]  And reminds you...
[5344.90s -> 5346.90s]  Reminds me of your hilarious
[5346.90s -> 5348.90s]  Grab That Auto 5 video and many more.
[5348.90s -> 5350.90s]  Thanks for being a hilarious entertainer
[5350.90s -> 5352.90s]  and genuine human being.
[5352.90s -> 5355.85s]  Oh, thank you.
[5355.85s -> 5360.78s]  Happy Rock. Thank you, Zaru.
[5360.78s -> 5362.78s]  Zaru. For the $5.
[5362.78s -> 5364.78s]  Re dollars.
[5364.78s -> 5366.78s]  The nibs. Thanks for the $5.
[5366.78s -> 5368.78s]  Can you wish my friend Justin
[5368.78s -> 5370.78s]  a happy birthday? Sure.
[5370.78s -> 5372.78s]  Happy birthday, Justin.
[5372.78s -> 5375.27s]  From me, Jerma985.
[5375.27s -> 5379.43s]  I hope you have
[5379.43s -> 5381.43s]  a healthy day
[5381.43s -> 5383.43s]  and things look great.
[5383.43s -> 5385.86s]  And I hope that you get cool.
[5385.86s -> 5389.58s]  Don't overdo it. Don't overdo it.
[5389.58s -> 5391.58s]  Yeah, this is turning into
[5391.58s -> 5393.58s]  a cameo.com video.
[5393.58s -> 5395.58s]  Yeah, sorry about that. Happy birthday, Justin.
[5395.58s -> 5406.33s]  Thanks for the $5.
[5406.33s -> 5412.41s]  Hunter Johnson.
[5412.41s -> 5414.41s]  Thanks for the $5. Can't wait for you to see my video
[5414.41s -> 5416.41s]  for Community Content Night.
[5416.41s -> 5421.38s]  Neither can I. 500 bits.
[5421.38s -> 5424.97s]  Jay Bong. Thanks for the $2.50.
[5424.97s -> 5426.97s]  Hey man, is your body ready for VR yet?
[5426.97s -> 5428.97s]  Or are you going to have to wear your boomer brace for a few more weeks?
[5428.97s -> 5430.97s]  I can't wait for you to play Boneworks
[5430.97s -> 5432.97s]  and Half-Life Alex.
[5432.97s -> 5434.97s]  Maybe invest in those index controllers.
[5434.97s -> 5438.10s]  Yeah, we talked about this in
[5438.10s -> 5440.10s]  pre-stream chat a little bit today, but
[5440.10s -> 5442.47s]  anything that requires
[5442.47s -> 5445.35s]  tilting, rotating,
[5445.35s -> 5447.35s]  and moving around and jumping
[5447.35s -> 5450.23s]  around, I could do it for
[5450.23s -> 5452.23s]  20 minutes or 30 minutes
[5452.23s -> 5454.47s]  or so, but it's really the
[5454.47s -> 5456.47s]  tilting and the leaning and the move
[5456.47s -> 5458.47s]  with that thing on my head
[5458.47s -> 5460.47s]  adding weight
[5460.47s -> 5462.47s]  to kind of my
[5462.47s -> 5464.47s]  cervical, whatever it is, spine,
[5464.47s -> 5466.47s]  whatever it is, the top part of your spine,
[5466.47s -> 5469.48s]  it might not be a great
[5469.48s -> 5474.34s]  idea. And
[5474.34s -> 5476.34s]  I kind of have to just try to
[5476.34s -> 5478.34s]  take care of this
[5478.34s -> 5484.23s]  and do it as best as I can.
[5484.23s -> 5489.16s]  But, cervical spine.
[5489.16s -> 5493.64s]  The cervical spine is where your
[5493.64s -> 5495.64s]  neck, that's the part, that's the spine where
[5495.64s -> 5497.64s]  your neck is, it's your neck bones.
[5497.64s -> 5505.11s]  What are you guys talking about?
[5505.11s -> 5509.91s]  What did you think I was talking about?
[5509.91s -> 5511.91s]  Cerebral? No, it's your
[5511.91s -> 5517.99s]  cervical spine.
[5517.99s -> 5519.99s]  You guys, what are you on about?
[5519.99s -> 5521.99s]  But, uh, Grain Screen
[5521.99s -> 5523.99s]  Part 2 is just
[5523.99s -> 5525.99s]  on indefinite hold.
[5525.99s -> 5527.99s]  Doing extensive VR is on
[5527.99s -> 5529.99s]  hold. I still have Connect
[5529.99s -> 5531.99s]  Games to play that, but I'm like, I can't
[5531.99s -> 5533.99s]  like run around my room and shit like I
[5533.99s -> 5535.99s]  just can't right now. That's the unfortunate
[5535.99s -> 5537.99s]  truth, they all have to be on indefinite hold
[5537.99s -> 5539.99s]  until
[5539.99s -> 5541.99s]  I have a real good permanent
[5541.99s -> 5543.99s]  solution for what's going on.
[5543.99s -> 5545.99s]  Right now it's physical therapy, and if
[5545.99s -> 5547.99s]  physical therapy doesn't work over the next
[5547.99s -> 5549.99s]  month or two, then I
[5549.99s -> 5551.99s]  have to go get an intercostal nerve block
[5551.99s -> 5553.99s]  injection into my body.
[5553.99s -> 5556.36s]  So, I'm sure
[5556.36s -> 5558.36s]  I'll probably be fine after that,
[5558.36s -> 5560.36s]  but that has to happen, but I don't want to do it yet.
[5560.36s -> 5566.89s]  That was a big word,
[5566.89s -> 5568.89s]  yeah, it was a very big word.
[5568.89s -> 5575.86s]  So, can't really do a whole lot of movement.
[5575.86s -> 5578.30s]  I'm not
[5578.30s -> 5580.30s]  hopefully not making a sound like a
[5580.30s -> 5582.30s]  I can't move like oil, oil
[5582.30s -> 5584.30s]  like
[5584.30s -> 5586.30s]  No, no, it's not like that,
[5586.30s -> 5588.30s]  but I don't want to aggravate anything.
[5588.30s -> 5590.30s]  Sudden movements can be like
[5590.30s -> 5592.73s]  ooh, ow, and
[5592.73s -> 5594.73s]  obviously if I'm doing physical therapy, I don't want to go to
[5594.73s -> 5596.73s]  my physical therapist and be like, oh hey, yeah
[5596.73s -> 5598.73s]  my like chest and back hurt really
[5598.73s -> 5600.73s]  bad today. I did a bunch of VR shit
[5600.73s -> 5602.73s]  and was like spinning around in circles.
[5602.73s -> 5604.73s]  Oh, are we starting at zero again
[5604.73s -> 5606.73s]  with physical therapy? Whoops.
[5606.73s -> 5612.94s]  I'm just concerned about it.
[5612.94s -> 5618.76s]  There you go.
[5618.76s -> 5621.70s]  Oylixes
[5621.70s -> 5623.70s]  or oylixes, thanks for the
[5623.70s -> 5627.86s]  thousand bits. Ten dollars.
[5627.86s -> 5630.23s]  Appreciate it. Hey, Jeremy,
[5630.23s -> 5632.23s]  I just wanted to say that after seeing
[5632.23s -> 5634.23s]  taxi after taxi drive into a building and
[5634.23s -> 5636.23s]  explode on contact, that was some of the
[5636.23s -> 5638.23s]  funny you should have seen in a long time.
[5638.23s -> 5640.23s]  And my diaphragm and cheeks still hurt from laughing.
[5640.23s -> 5642.23s]  I really needed to pick me up like that.
[5642.23s -> 5644.23s]  You're a perfect antidepressant.
[5644.23s -> 5646.23s]  Thank you for all you do, and I wish you the absolute
[5646.23s -> 5648.23s]  best on your road to recovery.
[5648.23s -> 5650.23s]  I can speak for everyone present when I say that we're all here to support
[5650.23s -> 5652.23s]  you as you've supported us.
[5652.23s -> 5654.23s]  There were a couple things
[5654.23s -> 5656.23s]  today that really got me going.
[5656.23s -> 5658.73s]  And yesterday too.
[5658.73s -> 5663.85s]  Now that
[5663.85s -> 5665.85s]  it wasn't even, it was the cars was funny.
[5665.85s -> 5667.85s]  The first like I hit the guy in the face
[5667.85s -> 5669.85s]  with polos, like I just didn't think he would even do that in
[5669.85s -> 5672.28s]  these games. They,
[5672.28s -> 5674.28s]  I don't think I want like the Marvel super heroes
[5674.28s -> 5676.28s]  to be the good guys.
[5676.28s -> 5678.28s]  That's what I'm saying in Spider-Man. You just walk up
[5678.28s -> 5680.28s]  and wave to people. You can't like blast
[5680.28s -> 5682.28s]  people in the face as hard as you can.
[5682.28s -> 5687.85s]  It's the Hulk. Yeah, I know.
[5687.85s -> 5689.85s]  But the Hulk doesn't like fucking hit people
[5689.85s -> 5695.74s]  with wrenches and shit.
[5695.74s -> 5697.74s]  Hulk does bad stuff.
[5697.74s -> 5701.90s]  I guess, but
[5701.90s -> 5703.90s]  I really appreciate that. And thanks for the $10.
[5703.90s -> 5707.61s]  The man with the baby hands thanks for
[5707.61s -> 5709.61s]  500 bits. Remember when Jerma One Guy
[5709.61s -> 5711.61s]  was the tier 3 emote?
[5711.61s -> 5714.62s]  Yep. But then we
[5714.62s -> 5716.62s]  found a really really good use for it.
[5716.62s -> 5718.62s]  So it had to become baseline.
[5718.62s -> 5721.88s]  I can't hide that behind
[5721.88s -> 5723.88s]  a $25 a month, are you serious?
[5723.88s -> 5726.57s]  That's one of the most important
[5726.57s -> 5729.19s]  ways for chat to communicate
[5729.19s -> 5732.65s]  with me. It's really
[5732.65s -> 5734.65s]  easy for you guys to spam that and I know
[5734.65s -> 5736.65s]  that I got one guide.
[5736.65s -> 5740.62s]  That's incredible communication
[5740.62s -> 5747.53s]  tool. But yeah, I do
[5747.53s -> 5753.67s]  remember that. Uh, Hallulu.
[5753.67s -> 5755.67s]  Hallulu. Thanks for the
[5755.67s -> 5758.36s]  350. Hi Jerma, the last time
[5758.36s -> 5760.36s]  I gave you bits I asked you for streaming advice and I
[5760.36s -> 5762.36s]  watched the VOD the next day
[5762.36s -> 5764.36s]  and watched stunned to find that this led
[5764.36s -> 5766.36s]  to you eating baby food on camera.
[5766.36s -> 5768.92s]  It was a little extra weird
[5768.92s -> 5770.92s]  because earlier that week I was in the market
[5770.92s -> 5772.92s]  and was eyeing the flavors they had
[5772.92s -> 5774.92s]  and wished they made adult versions
[5774.92s -> 5776.92s]  of some of them. You get it.
[5776.92s -> 5778.92s]  Sweet potato, carrot, and mango
[5778.92s -> 5780.92s]  why wouldn't I eat that?
[5780.92s -> 5782.92s]  Anyway, thanks and much love to you and chat.
[5782.92s -> 5787.53s]  It's a tip. It's a
[5787.53s -> 5792.70s]  real tip.
[5792.70s -> 5797.30s]  The whole gang is here.
[5797.30s -> 5803.83s]  It's real. I do that.
[5803.83s -> 5805.83s]  Alright, let's get the credits to roll. We have
[5805.83s -> 5808.97s]  only a few more bits to do. Let's actually
[5808.97s -> 5810.97s]  change the scenery here.
[5810.97s -> 5813.40s]  Watch your head.
[5813.40s -> 5822.47s]  Here we go. Oh wait, am I
[5822.47s -> 5824.78s]  am I not
[5824.78s -> 5826.78s]  logged in?
[5826.78s -> 5828.78s]  I'm not logged in.
[5828.78s -> 5831.34s]  I got de-logged out.
[5831.34s -> 5834.60s]  Gotta log back in.
[5834.60s -> 5840.17s]  Hold on.
[5840.17s -> 5844.97s]  Nobody subbed. Imagine.
[5844.97s -> 5846.97s]  Why do I feel like one of these days you guys are gonna coordinate
[5846.97s -> 5848.97s]  to make it so nobody does so that it just scrolls by
[5848.97s -> 5850.97s]  and just like thanks for subbing
[5850.97s -> 5852.97s]  and there's just no names. There's one or two.
[5852.97s -> 5861.21s]  There they come. All of you, thank you
[5861.21s -> 5865.75s]  again. I will see you tomorrow.
[5865.75s -> 5868.06s]  For...I don't know.
[5868.06s -> 5870.23s]  There are a few
[5870.23s -> 5872.41s]  very good options now.
[5872.41s -> 5879.26s]  We'll see which one we do. Thanks for all the subs.
[5879.26s -> 5886.60s]  You guys fucking rock.
[5886.60s -> 5888.60s]  We have a few more bits. We have Keith King Crimson
[5888.60s -> 5891.42s]  for 250. By the way,
[5891.42s -> 5893.42s]  to simp someone is like to
[5893.42s -> 5895.42s]  white knight them or like do
[5895.42s -> 5897.42s]  anything for them. It's a meme.
[5897.42s -> 5901.26s]  No, that was Peaceful Hayley.
[5901.26s -> 5904.33s]  It skipped up on me.
[5904.33s -> 5906.50s]  Peaceful, that was Peaceful Hayley. Did I say Peaceful
[5906.50s -> 5908.50s]  Hayley? Am I losing my mind?
[5908.50s -> 5911.38s]  It's just a meme. It's just a
[5911.38s -> 5916.38s]  meme. Hey, you said
[5916.38s -> 5918.38s]  it. You said it.
[5918.38s -> 5923.03s]  Thanks for the 250.
[5923.03s -> 5925.03s]  Thanks for the 250. I saw someone bring this up
[5925.03s -> 5927.03s]  and all the memories came back.
[5927.03s -> 5929.03s]  Remember clown in the town.
[5929.03s -> 5931.03s]  Now that you're a millionaire, this
[5931.03s -> 5933.03s]  project becomes much more reasonable, doesn't
[5933.03s -> 5935.03s]  it? Now gather star and MLC
[5935.03s -> 5937.03s]  Stealth and make it reality. Looking forward
[5937.03s -> 5942.22s]  to it. That's
[5942.22s -> 5944.22s]  one of the best ideas.
[5944.22s -> 5948.38s]  And we have that
[5948.38s -> 5950.38s]  conversation stamped.
[5950.38s -> 5952.38s]  It's like ours, you know what I mean?
[5952.38s -> 5954.38s]  If somebody does clown in the town, it's like, no, no, excuse
[5954.38s -> 5956.38s]  me. You took that from us.
[5956.38s -> 5961.56s]  That whole explanation of how
[5961.56s -> 5963.56s]  that would work is just, that would be
[5963.56s -> 5966.82s]  an amazing TV show. It'd be
[5966.82s -> 5972.84s]  fucking incredible. Keith King Crimson
[5972.84s -> 5974.84s]  thanks for the 250. Look, Jerma, I may
[5974.84s -> 5976.84s]  not be good at catching feathers or oysters
[5976.84s -> 5978.84s]  or tracing zodiac signs, but at least
[5978.84s -> 5981.14s]  I have to get
[5981.14s -> 5985.24s]  back to you on that one. What's clown
[5985.24s -> 5987.24s]  in the town? Clown in the town is one of those
[5987.24s -> 5989.24s]  things that it would take 45
[5989.24s -> 5991.24s]  minutes for me to explain it to you.
[5991.24s -> 5993.54s]  I think there are a couple of YouTube videos
[5993.54s -> 5995.54s]  that have the full thing
[5995.54s -> 6000.98s]  and it is the full explanation
[6000.98s -> 6004.31s]  of clown in the town. I have
[6004.31s -> 6006.31s]  it on my Soundcloud. Let me. Really?
[6006.31s -> 6012.58s]  Thank you, Keith King Crimson.
[6012.58s -> 6014.89s]  Anson is a copter.
[6014.89s -> 6016.89s]  I don't know.
[6016.89s -> 6018.89s]  I like doing things,
[6018.89s -> 6020.89s]  but I don't know if that thing is possible.
[6020.89s -> 6024.09s]  I don't know.
[6024.09s -> 6026.09s]  Hey, Tar Alecran, thanks for the 250. Just use the random Jerma
[6026.09s -> 6028.09s]  moment feature from that website and got one of those
[6028.09s -> 6030.09s]  10 minute stretches where you didn't talk
[6030.09s -> 6032.09s]  from rhythm heaven.
[6032.09s -> 6034.09s]  Alright, don't tell me
[6034.09s -> 6036.09s]  these things. Don't tell me these things.
[6036.09s -> 6038.09s]  This is like 3500 hours
[6038.09s -> 6042.76s]  of videos and streams. I wonder
[6042.76s -> 6044.76s]  what the algorithm, where it can pull
[6044.76s -> 6046.76s]  from? Is it possible to get pull from all of it?
[6046.76s -> 6052.33s]  I can't wait.
[6052.33s -> 6055.21s]  This is going to be so much fun.
[6055.21s -> 6057.21s]  I got one. It was a sim getting hit by a car.
[6060.22s -> 6062.22s]  Oh man, that's going to be so
[6062.22s -> 6066.57s]  funny. How does it determine
[6066.57s -> 6068.57s]  a moment? It just picks a random
[6068.57s -> 6070.57s]  timestamp on a random
[6070.57s -> 6072.57s]  stream.
[6072.57s -> 6080.36s]  And there are
[6080.36s -> 6082.36s]  uploaded and documented
[6082.36s -> 6084.36s]  about 3500 hours, which is probably
[6084.36s -> 6086.54s]  it's probably 70
[6086.54s -> 6088.54s]  to 80% of every stream I've ever done.
[6088.54s -> 6090.54s]  I think this is probably like streams
[6090.54s -> 6092.54s]  that have been lost that have not been uploaded
[6092.54s -> 6094.54s]  or that have got deleted somehow
[6094.54s -> 6096.54s]  over the last four or five years.
[6096.54s -> 6100.18s]  But I look forward to this.
[6100.18s -> 6104.73s]  This is going to be fun. There are
[6104.73s -> 6106.73s]  133 days.
[6106.73s -> 6109.22s]  That's a lot of content
[6109.22s -> 6111.22s]  to randomly generate.
[6111.22s -> 6121.32s]  I'm excited for this.
[6121.32s -> 6123.32s]  We're going to go channel surfing
[6123.32s -> 6126.52s]  from every stream I've ever done.
[6126.52s -> 6130.47s]  It'll be fun.
[6130.47s -> 6132.47s]  Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 250.
[6132.47s -> 6135.86s]  It's a time for new beginnings.
[6135.86s -> 6137.86s]  Garfield's full animated Sonic film
[6137.86s -> 6139.86s]  just premiered.
[6139.86s -> 6141.86s]  I'm sure there were a few delays, but it's out.
[6141.86s -> 6143.86s]  This is some drawn out joke about how I directed
[6143.86s -> 6145.86s]  the Sonic movie.
[6145.86s -> 6147.86s]  There's currently an hour long reanimated
[6147.86s -> 6149.86s]  Sonic film called Sonic Rebuilt for free
[6149.86s -> 6151.86s]  on YouTube. I know I can't
[6151.86s -> 6153.86s]  send links anymore, but it'd mean the world to me
[6153.86s -> 6157.13s]  if you checked some of it out.
[6157.13s -> 6159.13s]  Big shout out to all the animators who helped
[6159.13s -> 6162.14s]  directed it for you in chat.
[6162.14s -> 6169.37s]  This thing's an hour long? Link banned.
[6169.37s -> 6171.37s]  Hey, sorry, I'm fucking
[6171.37s -> 6173.37s]  Link banned.
[6173.37s -> 6180.92s]  That's cool that you
[6180.92s -> 6182.92s]  that's done. I didn't know it was going to be
[6182.92s -> 6184.92s]  that long. I thought this was like a
[6184.92s -> 6186.92s]  10 minute project.
[6186.92s -> 6188.92s]  Like a full hour long feature.
[6188.92s -> 6200.31s]  Holy shit. When's the rat movie
[6200.31s -> 6202.31s]  reanimated thing coming out?
[6202.31s -> 6206.15s]  Oh, I've heard about that.
[6206.15s -> 6208.46s]  Can we get a link? Yeah, check it out.
[6208.46s -> 6210.46s]  I can't really watch that right now.
[6210.46s -> 6212.70s]  But I will definitely
[6212.70s -> 6215.00s]  click it and I will watch it.
[6215.00s -> 6217.00s]  I don't think I
[6217.00s -> 6219.00s]  don't even watch TV shows for an hour.
[6219.00s -> 6227.64s]  I'll be honest with you. You know how long it's
[6227.64s -> 6229.64s]  taken for people to try to get me to watch Joel's
[6229.64s -> 6231.64s]  3D movie, Baker movie, that's like 26
[6231.64s -> 6234.07s]  minutes long?
[6234.07s -> 6236.07s]  Ah, fuck, I don't have
[6236.07s -> 6238.38s]  I'll watch it, I will.
[6238.38s -> 6245.78s]  But yeah, he still wants
[6245.78s -> 6247.78s]  you to watch it. I know, I know, I know,
[6247.78s -> 6249.78s]  I know. I have watched it. I've got a lot of
[6249.78s -> 6255.48s]  things to watch. Just watch it two minutes
[6255.48s -> 6258.17s]  at a time. No,
[6258.17s -> 6260.17s]  you can't just watch it one minute at a time.
[6260.17s -> 6263.88s]  Watch Joel's movie. Do it
[6263.88s -> 6265.88s]  on community content night. But it's not community
[6265.88s -> 6267.88s]  content night because Joel didn't make that
[6267.88s -> 6269.88s]  for community content night.
[6269.88s -> 6277.05s]  That's why you have to watch it two minutes.
[6277.05s -> 6279.42s]  Rip the Band-Aid off. He watches
[6279.42s -> 6281.42s]  your movies and you won't watch his?
[6281.42s -> 6285.37s]  Who cares? Watch it anyway. Yeah,
[6285.37s -> 6287.61s]  he did. It's not how it worked.
[6287.61s -> 6289.61s]  It's still content from the
[6289.61s -> 6293.00s]  community. Alright, well
[6293.00s -> 6295.00s]  we're gonna watch Joel's movie
[6295.00s -> 6297.00s]  not on Sunday. Not on Sunday.
[6297.00s -> 6299.00s]  We're gonna watch
[6299.00s -> 6301.00s]  Joel's 3D movie maker movie.
[6301.00s -> 6309.51s]  I'm gonna give you a date.
[6309.51s -> 6313.29s]  Thursday the
[6313.29s -> 6319.50s]  Hold on. Thursday the 12th.
[6319.50s -> 6321.67s]  On the shoe eating stream.
[6321.67s -> 6325.26s]  I'm gonna watch
[6325.26s -> 6327.26s]  Joel's movie maker movie
[6327.26s -> 6333.02s]  while I eat a shoe.
[6333.02s -> 6338.26s]  In fact, that's gonna be the first
[6338.26s -> 6340.50s]  stream after
[6340.50s -> 6342.94s]  coming back from
[6342.94s -> 6344.94s]  being off for a few days.
[6344.94s -> 6346.94s]  We're streaming tomorrow,
[6346.94s -> 6348.94s]  we're doing Sunday community content night, and
[6348.94s -> 6350.94s]  then I'm gonna be off for a few days.
[6350.94s -> 6352.94s]  When I come back on Thursday the 12th,
[6352.94s -> 6354.94s]  I'm gonna eat a fucking shoe.
[6354.94s -> 6357.37s]  And we're gonna watch that movie.
[6357.37s -> 6361.53s]  It's too much candy?
[6361.53s -> 6368.49s]  Don't worry. He needs a few days
[6368.49s -> 6370.49s]  to make an edible shoe.
[6370.49s -> 6383.42s]  I didn't say what kind
[6383.42s -> 6385.42s]  of shoe it had to be. It's just
[6385.42s -> 6387.42s]  a shoe or a
[6387.42s -> 6389.42s]  shoe-like substance.
[6393.77s -> 6396.58s]  What was that laugh?
[6396.58s -> 6398.58s]  I hated that.
[6398.58s -> 6401.34s]  That was a horrible laugh.
[6401.34s -> 6409.34s]  But we had 250 from
[6409.34s -> 6412.79s]  Goo Berry Juice.
[6412.79s -> 6414.79s]  If you want to find out if you're a bull or a koala,
[6414.79s -> 6416.79s]  try this quiz. It's not bad, I promise.
[6416.79s -> 6419.03s]  I think it'd be interesting to do it on stream.
[6419.03s -> 6421.03s]  Also, can I know which animal
[6421.03s -> 6423.03s]  to photoshop your face onto?
[6423.03s -> 6425.83s]  A lion.
[6425.83s -> 6427.83s]  Animalinu.com
[6427.83s -> 6429.83s]  Somebody remember that? Because we're doing that
[6429.83s -> 6432.84s]  on Thursday the 12th.
[6432.84s -> 6435.98s]  Thursday the 12th is gonna be
[6435.98s -> 6437.98s]  an absolute dog shit stream.
[6437.98s -> 6444.38s]  Thursday the 12th is gonna be the worst stream
[6444.38s -> 6446.38s]  of the year.
[6446.38s -> 6455.72s]  It's the fulfilled promise stream.
[6455.72s -> 6465.58s]  Okay, so look.
[6465.58s -> 6467.58s]  Let's be real.
[6467.58s -> 6469.58s]  I'm gonna watch a 3D movie maker movie
[6469.58s -> 6471.58s]  that's 30 minutes long, eat a
[6471.58s -> 6473.58s]  shoe on camera, and
[6473.58s -> 6477.22s]  do an animal quiz.
[6477.22s -> 6479.22s]  That's what's planned for the 12th.
[6479.22s -> 6487.21s]  So, sounds fun.
[6487.21s -> 6493.22s]  It sounds bad when you say it
[6493.22s -> 6495.53s]  like that. You mean saying it
[6495.53s -> 6501.99s]  out loud?
[6501.99s -> 6503.99s]  Wow, well thanks for the 400 bits.
[6503.99s -> 6507.13s]  Jerma Grinch.
[6507.13s -> 6510.01s]  With some snowmen emotes.
[6510.01s -> 6512.01s]  Don't eat a shoe. If you think I'm
[6512.01s -> 6514.01s]  gonna eat, like, a
[6514.01s -> 6516.50s]  Skechers shoe.
[6516.50s -> 6518.50s]  I don't know what to tell you.
[6518.50s -> 6523.05s]  I'm gonna eat a
[6523.05s -> 6527.77s]  shoe.
[6527.77s -> 6530.39s]  Shooo
[6530.39s -> 6543.88s]  on camera. Yes.
[6543.88s -> 6545.88s]  Awfutz.
[6545.88s -> 6548.63s]  Thanks for the 500 bits, Awfutz.
[6548.63s -> 6550.63s]  Five dollars, thanks a lot. Haven't been able to watch
[6550.63s -> 6552.63s]  the streams lately because of school, and I feel
[6552.63s -> 6554.63s]  incredibly behind, and I'm like missing out on all the
[6554.63s -> 6556.63s]  fun. The other day I started calling
[6556.63s -> 6558.63s]  you King, and you noticed that
[6558.63s -> 6560.63s]  three streams in a row, and kind of
[6560.63s -> 6562.63s]  seemed Monka-esque out.
[6562.63s -> 6564.63s]  It's just a reminder that you're
[6564.63s -> 6566.87s]  King. Thanks for the lulz.
[6566.87s -> 6572.25s]  Wait, so when I've been saying
[6572.25s -> 6574.25s]  You know, I've been seeing somebody
[6574.25s -> 6576.25s]  I've been seeing a lot of King. What's a King?
[6576.25s -> 6578.25s]  It was the same person.
[6578.25s -> 6584.12s]  And I just caught it three
[6584.12s -> 6586.12s]  times in a row. It's literally
[6586.12s -> 6590.73s]  just me.
[6590.73s -> 6594.36s]  Wow.
[6594.36s -> 6596.36s]  I thought it was if people write in it.
[6596.36s -> 6598.86s]  It's only been one person.
[6598.86s -> 6600.86s]  No one else has been doing it.
[6600.86s -> 6605.21s]  It's literally just
[6605.21s -> 6609.05s]  me. I thought it was a shit load
[6609.05s -> 6611.42s]  of people.
[6611.42s -> 6615.00s]  That's fucking funny.
[6615.00s -> 6617.00s]  Thanks for the five dollars, dude.
[6617.00s -> 6620.07s]  Opster Narwhal, again, thanks
[6620.07s -> 6622.07s]  for 253. Have you heard of the PlayStation
[6622.07s -> 6624.07s]  2 classic Muppets Party Cruise?
[6624.07s -> 6626.76s]  It's a true hidden gem, and must
[6626.76s -> 6628.76s]  be played on stream. So do it.
[6628.76s -> 6630.76s]  That or RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.
[6630.76s -> 6632.76s]  Also, people be paying
[6632.76s -> 6634.76s]  75,000 channel points for
[6634.76s -> 6636.76s]  Winx when I have an infinite amount
[6636.76s -> 6638.94s]  of German Wink, German Wink,
[6638.94s -> 6644.70s]  German Wink, German Wink. What does that mean?
[6644.70s -> 6651.03s]  Muppets Party Cruise.
[6651.03s -> 6660.06s]  Garfield the Monday Killer,
[6660.06s -> 6662.06s]  thanks for the 250. You don't have to watch the whole
[6662.06s -> 6664.06s]  thing on stream. Just skip around.
[6664.06s -> 6666.36s]  I just wanted some raw German commentary.
[6666.36s -> 6668.79s]  I don't know.
[6668.79s -> 6672.38s]  We'll do it on Sunday.
[6672.38s -> 6674.87s]  That's like a community piece of content
[6674.87s -> 6676.87s]  that qualifies.
[6676.87s -> 6678.87s]  I'll skip through and watch a couple of
[6678.87s -> 6686.87s]  pieces of it on Sunday.
[6686.87s -> 6688.87s]  What are you going to do? Don't starve together.
[6688.87s -> 6693.02s]  I don't think I am.
[6693.02s -> 6702.04s]  Winx are going to be half off on Sunday?
[6702.04s -> 6705.05s]  They might even be lower than that.
[6705.05s -> 6707.05s]  FutureGamer, thanks for 250. How is FTK
[6707.05s -> 6709.05s]  coming along? Any time frame yet?
[6709.05s -> 6711.93s]  Um, not
[6711.93s -> 6715.38s]  before German
[6715.38s -> 6718.01s]  Rumble charity.
[6718.01s -> 6720.01s]  There's going to be a charity German Rumble stream
[6720.01s -> 6722.01s]  that happens over the next few weeks.
[6722.01s -> 6730.65s]  A buddy of mine is running
[6730.65s -> 6733.27s]  in the Boston Marathon
[6733.27s -> 6735.27s]  and we are going to do a charity stream
[6735.27s -> 6738.02s]  to sponsor
[6738.02s -> 6740.58s]  his run.
[6740.58s -> 6742.58s]  And all the money that,
[6742.58s -> 6744.58s]  every cent that
[6744.58s -> 6746.58s]  comes into that stream
[6746.58s -> 6748.89s]  is going to be a couple of places to make it easy.
[6748.89s -> 6750.89s]  We'll go directly to
[6750.89s -> 6752.89s]  the foundation
[6752.89s -> 6755.06s]  that is going to sponsor
[6755.06s -> 6761.91s]  his run.
[6761.91s -> 6763.91s]  A lot of people were talking about charity
[6763.91s -> 6765.91s]  stuff and charity streams
[6765.91s -> 6767.91s]  and I've never really done one
[6767.91s -> 6769.91s]  on my own, on my own
[6769.91s -> 6772.22s]  channel.
[6772.22s -> 6774.22s]  I've been a part of a lot of other
[6774.22s -> 6776.22s]  great projects
[6776.22s -> 6778.22s]  and great charity events, right?
[6778.22s -> 6780.22s]  The Blind Saw stuff
[6780.22s -> 6782.22s]  the last couple of years has been
[6782.22s -> 6784.22s]  somewhat involved with some of it.
[6784.22s -> 6786.78s]  Obviously the Tip of the Hat stuff
[6786.78s -> 6788.78s]  in years past.
[6788.78s -> 6790.78s]  I've never done one, I've never
[6790.78s -> 6792.78s]  done one. I'm always on somebody
[6792.78s -> 6794.78s]  else's thing and I think it just,
[6794.78s -> 6796.78s]  it's time to try to do one. I just want to
[6796.78s -> 6798.78s]  try it and see if we can do some.
[6798.78s -> 6808.76s]  So there will be,
[6808.76s -> 6810.94s]  there will be a lot more information on that
[6810.94s -> 6813.88s]  a week or two before it
[6813.88s -> 6815.88s]  happens because I'm not just going to like do
[6815.88s -> 6817.88s]  a, hey here it, German Rumble,
[6817.88s -> 6819.88s]  here it is. At least two
[6819.88s -> 6821.88s]  or three weeks before that stream happens, which it has
[6821.88s -> 6823.88s]  to happen before
[6823.88s -> 6826.50s]  the, when's the Boston Marathon?
[6826.50s -> 6828.50s]  April like 10th? April 20th or something?
[6828.50s -> 6834.14s]  April 20th.
[6834.14s -> 6836.50s]  So before April 20th
[6836.50s -> 6839.38s]  it will be a stream.
[6839.38s -> 6841.69s]  And it's going to be the German Rumble.
[6841.69s -> 6843.86s]  I know it's a little late
[6843.86s -> 6845.86s]  but it'll be there.
[6845.86s -> 6852.31s]  It should be good.
[6852.31s -> 6854.31s]  But that is the end.
[6854.31s -> 6856.31s]  I will see you guys later.
[6856.31s -> 6859.38s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[6859.38s -> 6861.38s]  We got some options and I'll be in
[6861.38s -> 6863.38s]  pre-stream chat before the stream turns on.
[6863.38s -> 6865.38s]  So we can kind of discuss it,
[6865.38s -> 6868.39s]  talk about it. I am going to go, I am
[6868.39s -> 6870.39s]  very hungry. So I'm going to get out of here.
[6870.39s -> 6873.21s]  Have a good night, take care,
[6873.21s -> 6876.14s]  and goodbye. See you soon.
[6876.14s -> 6906.92s]  Right at the buzzer we had 250
[6906.92s -> 6908.92s]  from GooBerryJuice. Hey
[6908.92s -> 6910.92s]  King985, remember that game I talked about a few
[6910.92s -> 6912.92s]  streams ago? AlphaChimp, who is only
[6912.92s -> 6914.92s]  available on Xbox Live. Turns out it's free
[6914.92s -> 6916.92s]  on PC now. Please play it, it's so good.
[6916.92s -> 6923.06s]  Please God.
[6923.06s -> 6925.88s]  Thanks. Uh, maybe.
[6925.88s -> 6927.88s]  Not tomorrow and not the next day.
[6927.88s -> 6932.17s]  I'm
[6932.17s -> 6934.17s]  begging.
[6934.17s -> 6936.17s]  Please God in all
[6936.17s -> 6938.86s]  capitals. That means
[6938.86s -> 6940.86s]  never. No it doesn't. It means not immediately,
[6940.86s -> 6943.42s]  which means never.
[6943.42s -> 6945.42s]  But never on this channel doesn't actually mean never.
[6945.42s -> 6947.42s]  It means maybe a
[6947.42s -> 6949.59s]  year. You might just see it,
[6949.59s -> 6951.59s]  I don't think I was going to ever play Super Mario
[6951.59s -> 6953.59s]  Sunshine on this stream. I think like
[6953.59s -> 6956.79s]  two years ago, people
[6956.79s -> 6958.79s]  were like, hey dude, you should,
[6958.79s -> 6960.79s]  you're thinking about doing GameCube streams.
[6960.79s -> 6962.79s]  You're doing like PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 stuff.
[6962.79s -> 6964.79s]  You would love the GameCube stuff.
[6964.79s -> 6966.79s]  And I'm like, yeah, I don't know, maybe like in a few months.
[6966.79s -> 6968.79s]  You should play Mario Sunshine.
[6968.79s -> 6970.79s]  Yeah, I don't know. Probably not.
[6970.79s -> 6972.79s]  Here we are. It's been two years.
[6972.79s -> 6979.32s]  Never doesn't mean never on
[6979.32s -> 6981.50s]  this channel. It means like
[6981.50s -> 6983.50s]  probably not. For a long time.
[6983.50s -> 6991.48s]  But I did
[6991.48s -> 6993.48s]  not say that I was never going to play
[6993.48s -> 6995.48s]  AlphaChimp.
[6995.48s -> 7005.62s]  So don't worry. Don't worry.
[7005.62s -> 7007.62s]  Uh, then finally I have Obstinawal
[7007.62s -> 7009.62s]  for five dollars. So I'm going to ask this and I thought it
[7009.62s -> 7011.62s]  should be answered. Will the rumble be pushed
[7011.62s -> 7013.62s]  back if the marathon gets canceled due
[7013.62s -> 7015.62s]  to Corona? Or will we just
[7015.62s -> 7017.62s]  do it to get it out of the way?
[7017.62s -> 7019.62s]  Um, I, that's a
[7019.62s -> 7021.62s]  really, really, really good question.
[7021.62s -> 7023.62s]  Because I don't really have an answer for that.
[7023.62s -> 7028.68s]  Because I, I don't know
[7028.68s -> 7030.68s]  what, if that would happen or if it's
[7030.68s -> 7033.69s]  possible or what would
[7033.69s -> 7036.18s]  probably end up happening
[7036.18s -> 7039.00s]  is, hmm.
[7039.00s -> 7041.24s]  If something like that
[7041.24s -> 7043.42s]  does happen, which
[7043.42s -> 7045.42s]  God forbid, hopefully not, right?
[7045.42s -> 7047.42s]  I mean, hopefully this can be contained
[7047.42s -> 7049.42s]  and it's not, doesn't turn into
[7049.42s -> 7051.42s]  anything super serious.
[7051.42s -> 7053.42s]  Uh, but
[7053.42s -> 7055.42s]  in the event for some reason it does
[7055.42s -> 7057.42s]  turn into something like that.
[7057.42s -> 7060.68s]  Um, we'll probably
[7060.68s -> 7062.68s]  if it gets moved
[7062.68s -> 7065.05s]  we'll probably just do the same and move it.
[7065.05s -> 7069.21s]  And I might do a
[7069.21s -> 7071.21s]  sort of like a pre
[7071.21s -> 7073.21s]  not like a full rumble. Maybe I'll do
[7073.21s -> 7075.21s]  like a little like wrestling card
[7075.21s -> 7077.21s]  that's not the rumble but just maybe
[7077.21s -> 7079.21s]  introduces some of the new characters maybe.
[7079.21s -> 7081.21s]  Just for fun for like maybe like an hour or two.
[7081.21s -> 7086.31s]  We'll see.
[7086.31s -> 7088.31s]  There's no way that that's gonna happen.
[7088.31s -> 7090.31s]  I mean, what the probability
[7090.31s -> 7092.31s]  maybe, but I mean there's always a
[7092.31s -> 7094.31s]  chance that something bad could happen, right? There's always
[7094.31s -> 7096.31s]  a chance that something like this
[7096.31s -> 7098.49s]  is not contained and
[7098.49s -> 7100.49s]  for some reason it gets out of control
[7100.49s -> 7102.49s]  and it has to be lots of closings
[7102.49s -> 7104.49s]  and stuff. I mean it's, it's possible.
[7104.49s -> 7106.49s]  Is it probable? No.
[7106.49s -> 7108.49s]  But it's possible.
[7108.49s -> 7110.92s]  A lot of huge things have been cancelled recently.
[7110.92s -> 7112.92s]  Yeah, it's, I mean
[7112.92s -> 7116.06s]  some of them, yeah. Twitchcon
[7116.06s -> 7118.06s]  Amsterdam, ECCC.
[7118.06s -> 7123.22s]  Yeah.
[7123.22s -> 7125.22s]  I don't know. I guess that's kind of have to be
[7125.22s -> 7127.22s]  gonna have to be a wait and see scenario to see what actually
[7127.22s -> 7131.45s]  happens. It's
[7131.45s -> 7136.04s]  not a bad thing to think about though.
[7136.04s -> 7138.04s]  SXSW was cancelled, yeah.
[7138.04s -> 7140.71s]  That's true.
[7140.71s -> 7142.71s]  FutureGamer for 250, thanks a lot dude for the 250.
[7142.71s -> 7146.23s]  My school shut down
[7146.23s -> 7148.23s]  a
[7148.23s -> 7150.23s]  school shut down, a Rome travel study
[7150.23s -> 7152.23s]  and everyone was sent home and told to
[7152.23s -> 7154.23s]  self quarantine for 14 days. Jesus.
[7154.23s -> 7157.05s]  Yeah, this shit's no joke.
[7157.05s -> 7166.39s]  But we'll cross that bridge if we have to.
[7166.39s -> 7170.30s]  And I'll figure it out from there.
[7170.30s -> 7172.30s]  I'm gonna go. Before I
[7172.30s -> 7174.30s]  go, I'm going to
[7174.30s -> 7176.30s]  I'm gonna turn on
[7176.30s -> 7178.30s]  the voice
[7178.30s -> 7180.30s]  changer to low and echoey
[7180.30s -> 7182.30s]  and make a bunch of noises.
[7182.30s -> 7184.30s]  How you feel about that? Do you guys feel pretty good about that I think?
[7184.30s -> 7186.30s]  Right, that's
[7186.30s -> 7188.30s]  what I'm going for. And I'll see you tomorrow.
[7188.30s -> 7190.30s]  Have a good night.
[7190.30s -> 7199.11s]  Bye!
