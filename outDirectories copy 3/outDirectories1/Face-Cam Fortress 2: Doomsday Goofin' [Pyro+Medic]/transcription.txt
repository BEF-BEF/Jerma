[0.31s -> 15.74s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[15.74s -> 22.74s]  And today you're gonna be playing as the Pyro Scout. I don't think so. Maybe I do. Maybe you do think so.
[22.74s -> 29.82s]  Oh, it's a rabbit and a goose. There's a lot of people here. Oh my word! There's a lot of people here.
[32.14s -> 40.44s]  Oh my god! I only... Can I take on everybody? That's the real question. Absolutely no.
[40.44s -> 46.50s]  Can I get it? No, somebody already got it. Crap, he did.
[46.50s -> 52.12s]  Oh yeah, playing as the Pyro on the new game mode. This is Doomsday.
[53.12s -> 59.18s]  Give me that, Medic. Give me that, Medic!
[59.18s -> 65.18s]  I actually... I kinda like this mode. It's... It's hard to play, but at the same time, it's...
[65.18s -> 70.79s]  No, it was a spy. It's hard to play, but at the same time, it's just total chaos.
[70.79s -> 77.79s]  This entire mode is just pure chaos. I don't even know how the mode works still. I mean, I do, but I don't.
[77.79s -> 83.10s]  You pick up the thing, you put the suitcase on. Only one person can have the suitcase.
[83.10s -> 92.45s]  And you stand on the point, and you cap it, and then... I'm pretty sure I still don't know how this works after like 5,000 times playing it.
[92.45s -> 99.99s]  You have to put it in there. I'll do a more thorough review of this another time, but for now, it's just crazy. It's just absolute chaos.
[99.99s -> 103.81s]  And they got it again. We can't have that, baby.
[103.81s -> 109.44s]  Hmm, looking for someone to smoke. Like this guy!
[117.23s -> 122.31s]  Oh, boy. Where is he? Where is he?
[122.31s -> 126.19s]  Alright, he dropped it. He dropped it. He dropped it. We're good.
[126.19s -> 132.46s]  Come here, get healed. Oh... I'm gonna need that health.
[132.46s -> 136.47s]  Gotten this thing like it's my job. Because it is.
[136.47s -> 144.17s]  Alright, can we get the australium? And can we stuff it in that rocket and send Poopy Joe to hell?
[144.17s -> 149.61s]  A lot of scouts.
[153.41s -> 163.10s]  Oh, no. I'm trying to catch him with a flare gun. I can't even hit him. I can't even light him on fire!
[163.10s -> 167.72s]  My god, what's my ping? Pretty good. I don't know what's going on with that.
[167.72s -> 170.72s]  This sniper is probably gonna kill me. No, he's not.
[170.72s -> 178.21s]  Oh, wait. Is this the sniper? My brain cannot handle these situations.
[178.21s -> 181.21s]  And I missed again. And I missed again.
[181.21s -> 184.21s]  Not this time! Yeah, this time. You know, I'm just going in for this.
[184.21s -> 189.60s]  If the flare gun shot's not there today, then you might as well just go for the chaos smash.
[189.60s -> 191.97s]  Where's that spy?
[191.97s -> 195.68s]  Oh, here we go. We're gonna cap it.
[195.68s -> 199.05s]  Come on, cap it! No! No! Somebody get up there!
[199.05s -> 205.58s]  That was a random critter, I think.
[205.58s -> 208.82s]  Oh, now I got auto-balanced.
[208.82s -> 212.72s]  Well, that's one way for your recording to crash.
[212.72s -> 216.02s]  I'm sure there are other ways, but that's definitely one way.
[216.02s -> 220.03s]  Whoa. Let's start this again. I'm gonna actually...
[220.03s -> 224.03s]  I'm gonna get the Australian this time, and I'm gonna miss this sniper over and over again.
[224.03s -> 226.21s]  Maybe not this time. This time!
[226.21s -> 228.21s]  Nope. Scout.
[228.21s -> 230.21s]  Come on, come get it.
[230.21s -> 232.21s]  Come get it, you shut-up-a-bitch!
[232.21s -> 234.77s]  Spy? Spy? No.
[234.77s -> 237.65s]  No, no, I got it. I got it.
[237.65s -> 239.65s]  Burgaphone's got it.
[239.65s -> 241.65s]  You know what? We're gonna fake him out!
[241.65s -> 246.88s]  No, there's nobody there. All right, let's go.
[246.88s -> 250.21s]  Let's take it down the tunnel.
[250.21s -> 253.71s]  I'm gonna cap this, and Poopy Joe is gonna meet his maker.
[253.71s -> 255.71s]  Let's sneak around this way.
[255.71s -> 259.10s]  I got the bomb, guys!
[259.10s -> 262.05s]  I got the bomb!
[262.05s -> 264.05s]  Protect me, please. You're not a spy. Get on here, let's do it.
[264.05s -> 267.25s]  Come on, dudes. Everyone hop on this point.
[267.25s -> 271.66s]  I'm gonna cap this right now.
[271.66s -> 274.10s]  It's all about the dodging. It's all about the weaving.
[274.10s -> 277.23s]  Get out of here!
[277.23s -> 279.23s]  Get out of town! Get out of town!
[279.23s -> 281.23s]  Open up! Open up! Come on!
[281.23s -> 283.23s]  Open up! Open up, you son-of-a-bitch!
[283.23s -> 285.79s]  Open up! Open up! Please open up!
[285.79s -> 287.79s]  Please open up!
[287.79s -> 289.79s]  Oh my god!
[289.79s -> 292.67s]  That takes so long!
[292.67s -> 294.67s]  Holy crap, that takes a thousand years to open.
[294.67s -> 299.15s]  All right, let's try this again.
[299.15s -> 302.67s]  This thing's a toad. That was a lot.
[302.67s -> 305.87s]  Get out of here.
[305.87s -> 307.87s]  Poopy Joe. Poopy Joe.
[307.87s -> 309.87s]  Poopy Joe, start the chant.
[309.87s -> 312.62s]  Maybe it'll actually open this time.
[312.62s -> 315.74s]  Come on, open up.
[315.74s -> 318.56s]  I wanna send Poopy Joe to hell.
[318.56s -> 320.56s]  Oh god, it takes so long.
[320.56s -> 322.56s]  Get in there! Get in there!
[322.56s -> 324.56s]  Get inside!
[324.56s -> 326.56s]  Oh, here we go. Everyone's in the rocket.
[326.56s -> 328.56s]  Hey, oh my god!
[330.56s -> 332.56s]  Somebody please help me!
[332.56s -> 334.80s]  That was definitely the noise they were making when they were in that rocket.
[334.80s -> 336.80s]  Hell, that's pretty cool. I did it.
[336.80s -> 338.80s]  Go in there and dump it into the thing.
[338.80s -> 340.80s]  That's a smart idea.
[340.80s -> 342.80s]  You know, I'm not gonna stand up there.
[342.80s -> 345.81s]  That's a bad move.
[345.81s -> 348.56s]  I'm gonna sit right here and heal.
[348.56s -> 350.56s]  Because nobody will shoot at me.
[350.56s -> 352.56s]  I'll be able to sit down here and then I'm gonna get up top.
[352.56s -> 355.06s]  I'm gonna hit this heavy in the face.
[355.06s -> 357.23s]  Like this.
[357.23s -> 359.23s]  And like this.
[359.23s -> 361.23s]  And like this. Oh my god!
[364.42s -> 366.42s]  Hey everybody!
[366.42s -> 368.42s]  What's your name? My name is Jerma.
[368.42s -> 370.42s]  And you're gonna get smashed!
[370.42s -> 374.06s]  Oh my dear god!
[374.06s -> 376.06s]  I got an uber again.
[376.06s -> 378.62s]  Who can I do it to?
[382.34s -> 384.58s]  I just have uber forever right now.
[384.58s -> 388.93s]  Who can I do it to? There's gotta be somebody here!
[388.93s -> 391.81s]  Oh come on!
[391.81s -> 395.01s]  No! Run, run, run!
[395.01s -> 397.89s]  Wow!
[397.89s -> 401.79s]  Can't believe I'm still alive.
[401.79s -> 403.79s]  You wanna talk about combat medic?
[403.79s -> 405.79s]  He's almost had three ubers in a row right there.
[405.79s -> 408.80s]  I'll miss again.
[408.80s -> 411.10s]  Oh, he's running now. He wants none of this.
[411.10s -> 416.03s]  He wants none of this.
[416.03s -> 418.98s]  Who can I heal?
[418.98s -> 421.92s]  Whoa, bad idea, bad idea!
[424.35s -> 428.51s]  I thought...
[428.51s -> 430.82s]  They're gonna cap it.
[430.82s -> 433.95s]  Unless Derpy Dash can do something insane.
[433.95s -> 441.30s]  Let's move.
[441.30s -> 443.30s]  I think I've said that like five times coming out of spawn.
[443.30s -> 454.11s]  Let's do this!
[454.11s -> 462.61s]  That was so close!
[462.61s -> 464.61s]  That was so close to being a taunt kill.
[464.61s -> 468.13s]  But, it's the end.
[468.13s -> 477.14s]  They're gonna get it. I'm just waiting.
[477.14s -> 479.50s]  I got him! Did I get him?
[479.50s -> 481.50s]  Oh come on! This guy ruined everything!
[484.38s -> 486.38s]  Well, that's gonna wrap it up guys.
[486.38s -> 488.75s]  I'll see you guys all soon.
[488.75s -> 490.75s]  Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[490.75s -> 493.18s]  And of course, take care everybody.
[493.18s -> 495.18s]  I just spilt this.
