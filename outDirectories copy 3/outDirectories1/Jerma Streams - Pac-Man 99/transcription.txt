[10.87s -> 23.17s]  Black man 99. A 99 man battle royale against players from around the world.
[23.17s -> 26.90s]  Let's do it.
[26.90s -> 81.39s]  Fucking forgot the wood. I'll be right back.
[81.39s -> 84.83s]  Okay. I got it.
[84.83s -> 90.44s]  Alright, so. It's this thing.
[90.44s -> 94.69s]  Okay, here we go.
[94.69s -> 99.17s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[99.17s -> 103.54s]  It's this weird like tree trunk.
[103.54s -> 111.18s]  And I'm not gonna smell it, cause it smells like my dog's mouth.
[111.18s -> 114.93s]  But when this is out of the package, brand new.
[114.93s -> 120.05s]  It smells fantastic.
[120.05s -> 122.22s]  Right out of the package.
[122.22s -> 124.22s]  It smells like this awesome wood smell.
[124.22s -> 126.22s]  This has been in my dog's mouth.
[126.22s -> 128.22s]  Here it is. I'm not gonna put it in my mouth.
[128.22s -> 134.29s]  Mustache Ark?
[134.29s -> 146.45s]  Why is that so cool? It's not.
[146.45s -> 148.69s]  Alright. Pac-Man.
[148.69s -> 149.99s]  Let's go.
[149.99s -> 155.47s]  I'm pretty rusty. I haven't played Pac-Man in a long time.
[155.47s -> 165.22s]  I have played this though. Maybe like once.
[165.22s -> 167.91s]  Stream snipe his ass.
[167.91s -> 172.90s]  I don't know how this works.
[172.90s -> 174.90s]  You look like every math teacher in America.
[174.90s -> 179.62s]  That's kind of like, I'll take this as a compliment.
[179.62s -> 181.98s]  Alright, I want to do speed.
[181.98s -> 182.98s]  Speed.
[182.98s -> 188.81s]  Go. Knockout.
[188.81s -> 189.81s]  I don't even know what that means.
[189.81s -> 196.77s]  Oh shit.
[196.77s -> 197.77s]  Get these, right?
[197.77s -> 201.82s]  Speed and knockout.
[201.82s -> 205.47s]  What do these little things do?
[205.47s -> 212.06s]  Get it. Okay, get it. Go, go, go.
[212.06s -> 221.43s]  Pac-Man master.
[221.43s -> 223.43s]  I bet you I make it to the top ten.
[223.43s -> 225.43s]  I bet you I make it to the top five.
[225.43s -> 239.47s]  Look at that cherry.
[239.47s -> 250.14s]  What place am I in?
[250.14s -> 251.14s]  What place am I in?
[251.14s -> 259.27s]  Oh, it slowed up.
[259.27s -> 263.84s]  You're in last place?
[263.84s -> 264.84s]  I am not in last place.
[264.84s -> 266.84s]  I'm definitely in the top five.
[266.84s -> 275.38s]  Ah, it was risky.
[275.38s -> 276.38s]  I'm in trouble.
[276.38s -> 277.38s]  I'm in deep shit.
[277.38s -> 278.38s]  I'm dead.
[278.38s -> 280.38s]  Alright, I got to top fifty.
[280.38s -> 289.53s]  What did I get? I was top fifty?
[289.53s -> 292.18s]  That's still...
[292.18s -> 294.18s]  Hey, look, number fifty-one.
[294.18s -> 299.32s]  Alright, again.
[299.32s -> 300.32s]  Let's do it again.
[300.32s -> 303.78s]  I just had to warm up.
[303.78s -> 306.94s]  You suck.
[306.94s -> 309.94s]  I was fifty percent better than a hundred people.
[309.94s -> 311.24s]  What are you talking about?
[311.24s -> 313.24s]  I'm part of the curve.
[313.24s -> 315.24s]  I'm right in the middle.
[315.24s -> 324.20s]  You were bottom fifty percent.
[324.20s -> 331.77s]  I'm still better than half of the people that queued up.
[331.77s -> 334.77s]  Yes, I'm even including the people that queued up
[334.77s -> 337.58s]  and left their switch
[337.58s -> 341.02s]  and walked into the bathroom.
[341.02s -> 345.57s]  I did that at least a few times.
[345.57s -> 346.57s]  Alright, I'm going to do better this time.
[346.57s -> 347.57s]  Here we go.
[347.57s -> 350.77s]  I'm going to do stronger and...
[350.77s -> 352.77s]  stronger and...
[352.77s -> 353.77s]  and counter.
[353.77s -> 354.77s]  Alright, let's go.
[354.77s -> 356.77s]  I almost just fucking was the first person out.
[356.77s -> 371.94s]  That would have been embarrassing.
[371.94s -> 372.94s]  I need to get that.
[372.94s -> 373.94s]  Whoa!
[373.94s -> 374.94s]  Don't touch it.
[374.94s -> 378.35s]  Whoa!
[378.35s -> 383.66s]  I got to get all these guys.
[383.66s -> 384.66s]  There we are.
[384.66s -> 385.66s]  Alright, good, good, good, good, good.
[385.66s -> 389.46s]  Oh my god.
[389.46s -> 391.46s]  You can't even fuck with me.
[391.46s -> 393.46s]  I'm so good.
[393.46s -> 396.67s]  Damn it!
[396.67s -> 400.67s]  I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I got too cocky.
[400.67s -> 412.19s]  I have to finish in the top ten.
[412.19s -> 415.58s]  At least the top twenty.
[415.58s -> 419.34s]  Otherwise, I'm not allowed to leave the stream.
[419.34s -> 421.34s]  I need to get to top twenty-five
[421.34s -> 424.34s]  or I'm not allowed to turn off the stream.
[424.34s -> 439.55s]  Sound fair?
[439.55s -> 441.92s]  Sometimes you got to go for it immediately.
[441.92s -> 443.92s]  Knock out like ten people right now.
[443.92s -> 456.62s]  Alright, alright, whatever.
[456.62s -> 458.75s]  I fucked up.
[458.75s -> 459.75s]  I fucked up.
[459.75s -> 466.43s]  Whatever.
[466.43s -> 476.38s]  I fucked up.
[476.38s -> 477.38s]  It's alright.
[477.38s -> 483.35s]  Eighty-four.
[483.35s -> 484.35s]  Your license is going to get revoked.
[484.35s -> 485.35s]  I'm going to be fine.
[485.35s -> 490.13s]  I'm going to get top twenty-five right now.
[490.13s -> 493.13s]  I lost so quickly it took a while to get me another game.
[493.13s -> 515.94s]  I don't even really know how this works.
[515.94s -> 516.94s]  There we go.
[516.94s -> 517.94s]  Alright, good, good, good, good, good.
[517.94s -> 523.14s]  Go, go, go, go.
[523.14s -> 524.14s]  Come up here.
[524.14s -> 525.14s]  Follow me up here.
[525.14s -> 533.10s]  Go.
[533.10s -> 534.10s]  There it is.
[534.10s -> 546.54s]  Go.
[546.54s -> 550.86s]  Go for it.
[550.86s -> 551.86s]  Oh, come on.
[551.86s -> 556.68s]  What?
[556.68s -> 557.68s]  Guys, don't blow it.
[557.68s -> 558.68s]  Don't blow it.
[558.68s -> 565.36s]  Just chill.
[565.36s -> 566.36s]  Get it?
[566.36s -> 567.36s]  Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[567.36s -> 568.36s]  Help me.
[568.36s -> 582.45s]  Help me.
[582.45s -> 583.45s]  Help me.
[583.45s -> 587.18s]  I need new ones.
[587.18s -> 588.18s]  Come on.
[588.18s -> 589.18s]  Come on.
[589.18s -> 592.47s]  Come on.
[592.47s -> 598.77s]  Come on.
[598.77s -> 599.77s]  Come on.
[599.77s -> 600.77s]  Where's my stuff?
[600.77s -> 601.77s]  Where is it?
[601.77s -> 606.08s]  Come on.
[606.08s -> 607.08s]  Give me my pill.
[607.08s -> 609.09s]  Where's the pills?
[609.09s -> 611.03s]  Where's my pills?
[611.03s -> 612.03s]  The strawberry.
[612.03s -> 613.03s]  I don't even know how this works.
[613.03s -> 614.03s]  You have to get the fruit?
[614.03s -> 615.03s]  I don't even know how this works.
[615.03s -> 621.33s]  You have to get the fruit.
[621.33s -> 622.70s]  What?
[622.70s -> 626.11s]  I had so many opportunities to get it.
[626.11s -> 629.11s]  I didn't even know that's how the game was played.
[629.11s -> 630.11s]  What does the fruit do?
[630.11s -> 632.42s]  This is the first time I've ever been to that point.
[632.42s -> 635.72s]  This is like the eighth time I've played this game.
[635.72s -> 636.96s]  I'm sorry.
[636.96s -> 637.96s]  I don't know what to do.
[637.96s -> 644.68s]  The fruit refills the board.
[644.68s -> 647.68s]  That would have been fucking nice to know 100 years ago.
[647.68s -> 648.68s]  All right.
[648.68s -> 649.68s]  I'm going to win.
[649.68s -> 650.68s]  Let's go.
[650.68s -> 659.92s]  I was just lost.
[659.92s -> 663.22s]  That would have been really embarrassing.
[663.22s -> 674.19s]  I only get the fruit when I need to, right?
[674.19s -> 682.22s]  Oh, what's with the fucking controller?
[683.22s -> 693.29s]  Why am I not?
[693.29s -> 694.29s]  I'm not getting like any stuff.
[694.29s -> 696.55s]  Where's the...
[696.55s -> 698.05s]  What's going on?
[698.05s -> 706.09s]  Oh, the fruit just refills the whole board.
[706.09s -> 707.09s]  I get it.
[707.09s -> 716.78s]  All right.
[716.78s -> 718.40s]  I don't get that.
[718.40s -> 719.40s]  I don't need it.
[719.40s -> 726.85s]  Holy shit.
[726.85s -> 727.85s]  They're going to turn.
[727.85s -> 728.85s]  This is risky.
[728.85s -> 746.47s]  This is risky, but I'm going to do it.
[746.47s -> 747.71s]  Get out of here.
[747.71s -> 748.71s]  See that move?
[748.71s -> 749.71s]  Did you see those moves?
[749.71s -> 750.71s]  Are you paying attention?
[750.71s -> 777.30s]  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[777.30s -> 786.54s]  Go down and get it.
[786.54s -> 787.54s]  Oh, I'm so slow.
[787.54s -> 797.61s]  Oh.
[797.61s -> 798.61s]  Come on.
[798.61s -> 806.89s]  Come on.
[806.89s -> 808.70s]  Come on.
[808.70s -> 809.70s]  I didn't know that's what that did.
[809.70s -> 810.70s]  I didn't know that's what that...
[810.70s -> 812.70s]  I didn't know that's what that did.
[812.70s -> 814.18s]  I didn't know the red ones where it could kill you.
[814.18s -> 815.18s]  I didn't know that's what that did.
[815.18s -> 818.45s]  I thought it was just the ghosts.
[818.45s -> 819.97s]  I always had a chance there.
[819.97s -> 822.94s]  What?
[822.94s -> 824.94s]  I didn't know that was what happened.
[824.94s -> 825.94s]  It's all right.
[825.94s -> 826.94s]  I win.
[826.94s -> 827.94s]  Oh, what?
[827.94s -> 830.84s]  Oh, my God.
[830.84s -> 832.84s]  I thought I could just walk by them.
[832.84s -> 834.84s]  I thought this made you extra slow.
[834.84s -> 837.42s]  Okay.
[837.42s -> 838.42s]  Now I know.
[838.42s -> 839.42s]  Now I know.
[839.42s -> 840.66s]  I'm ready.
[840.66s -> 845.10s]  Let's go.
[845.10s -> 847.88s]  I'm going to win.
[847.88s -> 848.88s]  I got top 25.
[848.88s -> 849.88s]  It sounds so different playing this game.
[849.88s -> 850.88s]  I'm talking like this.
[850.88s -> 851.88s]  I'm talking like this.
[851.88s -> 865.28s]  I don't know why.
[865.28s -> 866.28s]  Gary Seinfeld.
[866.28s -> 867.28s]  Yeah.
[867.28s -> 869.35s]  Relax.
[869.35s -> 870.35s]  I'm going to get to first.
[870.35s -> 871.35s]  At least top 10.
[871.35s -> 872.35s]  Now that I understand how the game works.
[872.35s -> 882.50s]  It took me a little while.
[882.50s -> 883.50s]  That train over here.
[883.50s -> 885.10s]  I'm going to get my own train.
[885.10s -> 886.10s]  Check this out.
[886.10s -> 890.29s]  Oh, I just...
[890.29s -> 893.45s]  I think I just fucking messed up everybody's game.
[893.45s -> 917.98s]  I just knocked out like 30 people and I'm both...
[917.98s -> 927.06s]  Oh, yeah.
[927.06s -> 928.06s]  So many ghosts.
[928.06s -> 936.02s]  Ooh.
[936.02s -> 937.02s]  That was close.
[937.02s -> 949.42s]  I got to go up top right.
[956.06s -> 957.06s]  Wow.
[957.06s -> 966.87s]  This bit rate.
[966.87s -> 967.87s]  Is it bad?
[967.87s -> 980.98s]  Oh, that didn't last very long.
[980.98s -> 981.98s]  Now it does it.
[981.98s -> 992.18s]  Do it again.
[992.18s -> 998.66s]  Watch it.
[998.66s -> 1006.94s]  He's going to turn.
[1006.94s -> 1007.94s]  Okay.
[1007.94s -> 1013.02s]  This is going to be a monster.
[1013.02s -> 1014.02s]  Oh, my God.
[1014.02s -> 1032.54s]  Out of my way.
[1032.54s -> 1040.44s]  Oh, shit.
[1040.44s -> 1047.76s]  Oh, no.
[1047.76s -> 1048.76s]  My finger.
[1048.76s -> 1049.76s]  It went down.
[1049.76s -> 1050.76s]  That stupid thing.
[1050.76s -> 1053.16s]  I didn't want it to go down that way.
[1053.16s -> 1063.56s]  It just like went down that way because the analog sucks.
[1063.56s -> 1064.56s]  Like it just...
[1064.56s -> 1065.56s]  I go down that way.
[1065.56s -> 1074.86s]  All right.
[1074.86s -> 1075.86s]  All right.
[1075.86s -> 1083.06s]  I'm good.
[1083.46s -> 1084.82s]  Fucking analog.
[1084.82s -> 1087.65s]  Oh, this game is actually pretty fun.
[1087.65s -> 1093.11s]  All right.
[1093.11s -> 1094.11s]  No more analog.
[1094.11s -> 1095.11s]  It sucks.
[1095.11s -> 1096.11s]  It never does what I want it to do.
[1096.11s -> 1097.11s]  Use the buttons.
[1097.11s -> 1098.11s]  I can't use the buttons.
[1098.11s -> 1099.11s]  You have to use the analog.
[1099.11s -> 1101.76s]  Well, that's unfortunate.
[1101.76s -> 1104.28s]  Every time you see me just like go to the left for no reason, it's because the analog
[1104.28s -> 1105.28s]  sucks.
[1105.28s -> 1108.03s]  I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[1108.03s -> 1111.19s]  I can give myself an excuse to lose every time.
[1111.19s -> 1125.46s]  I'm building up this shit.
[1125.46s -> 1128.02s]  I'm going to destroy somebody.
[1128.02s -> 1148.06s]  Somebody is so fucked right here.
[1148.06s -> 1149.06s]  Wow.
[1149.06s -> 1150.06s]  Careful.
[1153.54s -> 1154.54s]  Again.
[1154.54s -> 1158.79s]  I want to go down.
[1158.79s -> 1159.79s]  It's not what I wanted to do.
[1159.79s -> 1165.06s]  Oh, fuck.
[1165.06s -> 1176.10s]  Down here.
[1176.10s -> 1177.10s]  Let's go.
[1177.10s -> 1187.04s]  Counter.
[1187.04s -> 1188.41s]  All right.
[1188.41s -> 1192.46s]  What do these do?
[1192.46s -> 1193.46s]  I have no idea.
[1193.46s -> 1196.62s]  Hopefully, it's good.
[1196.62s -> 1197.62s]  That was absurd what just happened.
[1197.62s -> 1198.62s]  That's all right.
[1198.62s -> 1213.62s]  Watch out for the red ones.
[1213.62s -> 1214.62s]  Here they come.
[1214.62s -> 1218.17s]  Oh, there's so many over there.
[1218.17s -> 1220.62s]  Careful.
[1220.62s -> 1221.62s]  Oh, I need a fruit.
[1221.62s -> 1222.62s]  I need a fruit right now.
[1222.62s -> 1227.64s]  I need a fruit right now.
[1227.64s -> 1229.39s]  Risky move.
[1229.39s -> 1230.39s]  Got it.
[1230.39s -> 1231.39s]  Oh, eat shit.
[1231.39s -> 1232.95s]  Everyone is so strong.
[1232.95s -> 1233.95s]  I need a fruit right now.
[1233.95s -> 1236.09s]  I need a fruit right now.
[1236.09s -> 1237.09s]  Risky move.
[1237.09s -> 1243.38s]  Got it.
[1243.38s -> 1244.38s]  Oh, eat shit.
[1244.94s -> 1248.36s]  Everyone is so screwed here.
[1248.36s -> 1249.36s]  Oh.
[1249.36s -> 1275.13s]  Going out of my way.
[1275.13s -> 1276.13s]  No.
[1276.13s -> 1278.07s]  No.
[1278.07s -> 1279.07s]  Did I win?
[1279.07s -> 1282.68s]  Oh.
[1282.68s -> 1283.68s]  Top eight.
[1283.68s -> 1287.61s]  Damn it.
[1287.61s -> 1289.74s]  I got trapped.
[1289.74s -> 1290.74s]  Yeah.
[1290.74s -> 1291.74s]  Damn it.
[1291.74s -> 1297.98s]  This is fun.
[1297.98s -> 1298.98s]  This is a lot of fun.
[1298.98s -> 1304.18s]  Change of control scheme.
[1304.18s -> 1305.18s]  I'll get used to it.
[1305.18s -> 1306.18s]  This game really woke me up.
[1306.18s -> 1308.19s]  Good.
[1308.19s -> 1309.19s]  I got top ten.
[1309.19s -> 1322.53s]  Let's see if I can get top five.
[1322.53s -> 1323.53s]  Should I just do stronger speed?
[1323.53s -> 1324.53s]  I don't know.
[1324.53s -> 1326.34s]  What's the play?
[1326.34s -> 1327.34s]  I don't even know what the play is.
[1327.34s -> 1328.34s]  I'm going to do stronger.
[1328.34s -> 1331.44s]  I'm going to do stronger.
[1331.44s -> 1337.05s]  This is a really bad idea, but I did it anyways.
[1337.05s -> 1347.38s]  Already?
[1347.38s -> 1348.38s]  Off already?
[1348.38s -> 1358.90s]  What are you talking about?
[1358.90s -> 1360.74s]  Dude, that shit is not lasting at all.
[1360.74s -> 1362.38s]  That's lasting not at all.
[1362.38s -> 1363.38s]  What's going on with that time?
[1363.38s -> 1365.13s]  Look at this.
[1365.13s -> 1366.13s]  Why is it lasting so infrequent?
[1366.13s -> 1367.62s]  Look at that.
[1367.62s -> 1377.36s]  What's going on with this?
[1377.36s -> 1378.36s]  Take off stronger.
[1378.36s -> 1379.36s]  Speed.
[1379.36s -> 1380.36s]  Oh, my God.
[1380.36s -> 1381.36s]  I'm not even looking.
[1381.36s -> 1387.39s]  What was going on there?
[1387.39s -> 1388.39s]  Because you're...
[1388.39s -> 1389.39s]  All right.
[1389.39s -> 1396.09s]  Before I do anything, what the hell does all this stuff do?
[1396.09s -> 1398.06s]  What is speed?
[1398.78s -> 1406.42s]  What does strong...
[1406.42s -> 1407.42s]  What does mean?
[1407.42s -> 1408.42s]  Should I just stay on the one I had on?
[1408.42s -> 1416.35s]  The right side is who you attack.
[1416.35s -> 1417.83s]  Yeah, I just keep it on random.
[1417.83s -> 1423.17s]  You need to clear the board to upgrade the stat on the left.
[1423.17s -> 1457.02s]  I'm keeping on speed down this way.
[1457.02s -> 1459.18s]  Clear the board before doing anything else.
[1459.18s -> 1461.50s]  So I should clear the whole board.
[1461.50s -> 1464.09s]  All right.
[1464.09s -> 1467.06s]  I cleared it.
[1467.06s -> 1468.06s]  Speed up.
[1468.06s -> 1469.06s]  Oh, okay.
[1469.06s -> 1475.35s]  I get it.
[1475.35s -> 1476.35s]  Shit.
[1476.35s -> 1481.18s]  I didn't want to do that.
[1481.18s -> 1482.18s]  Fucking analog.
[1482.18s -> 1484.89s]  My God.
[1484.89s -> 1485.89s]  The analog sucks.
[1485.89s -> 1486.89s]  Back to the drawing board, Nintendo.
[1487.73s -> 1488.73s]  An awful controller.
[1488.73s -> 1505.65s]  All right.
[1505.65s -> 1506.95s]  Everybody's dead.
[1506.95s -> 1528.54s]  Speed up.
[1528.54s -> 1542.01s]  What?
[1542.01s -> 1543.01s]  Get away from me.
[1543.01s -> 1548.02s]  I got to clear the board.
[1548.02s -> 1555.09s]  You're still alive.
[1555.09s -> 1556.09s]  You have to die.
[1556.09s -> 1557.09s]  No.
[1557.09s -> 1588.86s]  Fucking analog.
[1588.86s -> 1589.86s]  Watch it.
[1589.86s -> 1590.86s]  Watch it.
[1590.86s -> 1591.86s]  Wow.
[1591.86s -> 1593.22s]  And they moved.
[1593.22s -> 1594.53s]  I didn't know they moved.
[1594.53s -> 1595.53s]  What?
[1595.53s -> 1596.53s]  I thought they stood still.
[1596.53s -> 1597.53s]  Oh, my God.
[1597.53s -> 1599.21s]  If I only just knew the fucking rules, I'd be number one.
[1599.21s -> 1612.09s]  Clear the pellets, not the ghosts.
[1612.09s -> 1615.63s]  Oh.
[1615.63s -> 1616.63s]  Calm down.
[1616.63s -> 1617.63s]  Yeah.
[1617.63s -> 1618.63s]  All right.
[1618.63s -> 1619.63s]  I need to, like, honestly...
[1619.63s -> 1621.26s]  Like, I need to shut the hell up.
[1622.18s -> 1623.18s]  Wow.
[1623.18s -> 1624.18s]  Wee.
[1624.18s -> 1625.18s]  Wow.
[1625.18s -> 1626.18s]  Like, what?
[1626.18s -> 1627.18s]  Would you fucking inject caffeine into your jugular vein?
[1627.18s -> 1628.18s]  Like, sit down.
[1628.18s -> 1630.76s]  What the hell am I doing?
[1630.76s -> 1631.76s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[1631.76s -> 1644.58s]  All right.
[1644.58s -> 1654.02s]  This is the one.
[1654.02s -> 1661.40s]  Get rid of these pellets.
[1661.40s -> 1667.89s]  All right.
[1667.89s -> 1668.89s]  That's a full clear.
[1668.89s -> 1669.89s]  Did I not...
[1669.89s -> 1670.89s]  Was it one of the...
[1670.89s -> 1671.89s]  Oh.
[1671.89s -> 1672.89s]  Fuck.
[1672.89s -> 1673.89s]  There's one on the top left.
[1673.89s -> 1674.89s]  Shit.
[1674.89s -> 1692.83s]  All right.
[1692.83s -> 1694.39s]  Stop paying attention to that and just be a good Pac-Man gamer.
[1694.39s -> 1695.39s]  Did that not work?
[1695.39s -> 1696.39s]  Am I losing my mind?
[1696.39s -> 1703.84s]  What's going on?
[1703.84s -> 1704.84s]  Oh.
[1704.84s -> 1706.84s]  Every pellet needs to be cleared, not just the big ones.
[1707.76s -> 1708.76s]  I thought you meant, like, the big pellets.
[1708.76s -> 1715.18s]  That kind of sucks.
[1715.18s -> 1723.21s]  Don't touch that.
[1723.21s -> 1724.21s]  All right.
[1724.21s -> 1731.46s]  Let's go.
[1731.46s -> 1747.68s]  Speed up.
[1747.68s -> 1752.95s]  Kill.
[1752.95s -> 1753.95s]  Excuse me.
[1753.95s -> 1763.51s]  Thank you.
[1763.51s -> 1778.64s]  Oh.
[1778.64s -> 1779.64s]  You just totally screwed me here.
[1779.64s -> 1791.18s]  Oh.
[1791.18s -> 1792.18s]  I'm in trouble.
[1792.18s -> 1793.18s]  Down.
[1793.18s -> 1796.15s]  I'm in trouble.
[1796.15s -> 1797.15s]  Shit.
[1797.15s -> 1799.80s]  It's hard.
[1799.80s -> 1812.86s]  Is that the right one to counter?
[1812.86s -> 1813.86s]  Maybe.
[1813.86s -> 1817.66s]  This is the one.
[1817.66s -> 1818.66s]  All right.
[1818.66s -> 1820.22s]  I'm going to do...
[1820.22s -> 1821.22s]  I'm going to do 10 more attempts.
[1821.22s -> 1822.22s]  Okay.
[1822.22s -> 1827.04s]  This is attempt number one of 10.
[1828.84s -> 1830.84s]  Let's focus on getting huge ghost combos.
[1830.84s -> 1832.53s]  Yeah.
[1832.53s -> 1833.53s]  I wonder what the other ones...
[1833.53s -> 1834.53s]  If the other ones are better.
[1834.53s -> 1836.60s]  So, I'm doing speed.
[1836.60s -> 1837.60s]  What are the other ones?
[1837.60s -> 1839.86s]  Like, train?
[1839.86s -> 1840.86s]  I wonder what train is.
[1840.86s -> 1841.86s]  Should I do train?
[1841.86s -> 1842.86s]  I'm going to try train.
[1842.86s -> 1846.02s]  I like train.
[1846.02s -> 1871.41s]  I don't want to pick up the...
[1871.41s -> 1881.46s]  Groot.
[1881.46s -> 1882.46s]  Yeah.
[1882.46s -> 1891.06s]  How bad is the bitrate?
[1891.06s -> 1892.06s]  All right.
[1892.06s -> 1893.06s]  Speed up.
[1893.06s -> 1901.98s]  It's not on train?
[1901.98s -> 1902.98s]  Let's go for a huge train here.
[1902.98s -> 1917.86s]  I'm just going to try to survive.
[1917.86s -> 1919.86s]  I'm not going to go for, like, clearing the whole board.
[1921.02s -> 1923.02s]  I mean, I'm probably going to need it.
[1923.02s -> 1924.02s]  I know.
[1924.02s -> 1928.41s]  But after a couple of times, I'm just going to go for skill only.
[1928.41s -> 1944.11s]  Watch out.
[1944.11s -> 1945.86s]  Oh, mistake.
[1945.86s -> 1946.86s]  Big mistake.
[1946.86s -> 1947.86s]  I'm good.
[1947.86s -> 1948.86s]  Wow.
[1948.86s -> 1966.81s]  That was lucky.
[1966.81s -> 1967.81s]  That was very close.
[1967.81s -> 1985.82s]  Get out of here.
[1985.82s -> 1993.65s]  Jeremy!
[1993.65s -> 1994.65s]  The game bugged.
[1994.65s -> 1995.65s]  I just got a free...
[1995.65s -> 1996.65s]  I cheated.
[1996.65s -> 1997.65s]  I don't even know how I did that.
[1997.65s -> 1998.65s]  I don't know what happened.
[1998.65s -> 2007.12s]  I think I may have just cheated.
[2007.12s -> 2008.12s]  Huge train.
[2008.12s -> 2021.07s]  Let's go.
[2021.07s -> 2022.07s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[2022.07s -> 2033.74s]  Risky.
[2034.66s -> 2078.46s]  What happened?
[2078.46s -> 2092.82s]  Did I win?
[2092.82s -> 2097.52s]  Did I get to...
[2097.52s -> 2112.97s]  Did I win?
[2112.97s -> 2113.97s]  Did I win?
[2113.97s -> 2116.94s]  Did I just win?
[2116.94s -> 2118.94s]  I won.
[2118.94s -> 2120.12s]  What happened?
[2120.12s -> 2121.12s]  Oh, no.
[2121.12s -> 2122.36s]  I touched the red one.
[2122.36s -> 2126.61s]  It spawned on me.
[2126.61s -> 2127.61s]  Oh, come on.
[2127.61s -> 2128.61s]  No.
[2128.61s -> 2129.61s]  Oh, what?
[2129.61s -> 2130.61s]  Oh, that sucks.
[2130.61s -> 2131.61s]  Did it spawn, like, right there?
[2131.61s -> 2132.61s]  Damn it.
[2132.61s -> 2133.61s]  Oh, I thought I had that one.
[2133.61s -> 2134.61s]  Damn it.
[2134.61s -> 2135.61s]  Oh, no.
[2135.61s -> 2136.61s]  Oh, no.
[2136.61s -> 2139.32s]  Oh, no.
[2139.32s -> 2140.32s]  Oh, no.
[2140.32s -> 2141.69s]  Oh, no.
[2141.69s -> 2142.69s]  Oh, no.
[2142.69s -> 2145.21s]  Oh, no.
[2145.21s -> 2146.21s]  Oh, no.
[2146.33s -> 2147.33s]  I thought I had that one.
[2147.33s -> 2148.33s]  Damn it.
[2148.33s -> 2164.75s]  That was a good run.
[2164.75s -> 2165.75s]  Number two, Victory Royale.
[2165.75s -> 2172.22s]  The red ones don't disappear, yeah.
[2172.22s -> 2173.22s]  That's true.
[2173.22s -> 2176.18s]  Oh.
[2176.18s -> 2182.50s]  That's what fucks with me more than anything.
[2182.50s -> 2183.50s]  I'm not...
[2183.50s -> 2184.50s]  What was train even doing?
[2184.50s -> 2185.68s]  Stay speed.
[2185.68s -> 2195.43s]  All right, that was...
[2195.43s -> 2196.43s]  That was a...
[2196.43s -> 2197.43s]  I really...
[2197.43s -> 2198.43s]  I kind of fucked that one up.
[2198.43s -> 2199.43s]  Sorry.
[2199.43s -> 2200.43s]  I'm still...
[2200.43s -> 2201.43s]  My nerves are up from the last run.
[2201.43s -> 2202.43s]  I'm almost winning.
[2202.43s -> 2203.80s]  My nerves...
[2203.80s -> 2205.80s]  I'm, like, still a little shaky.
[2205.80s -> 2206.80s]  All right?
[2206.80s -> 2216.62s]  It's okay.
[2216.62s -> 2217.62s]  I thought I had that, too.
[2219.10s -> 2223.86s]  All right.
[2223.86s -> 2224.86s]  We'll get the next one.
[2224.86s -> 2225.86s]  Poor thing.
[2225.86s -> 2226.86s]  He's shaking.
[2226.86s -> 2244.94s]  No, it's just when you come that close, you just, like, start to go, like, oh, shit.
[2244.94s -> 2245.94s]  All right.
[2245.94s -> 2259.60s]  Let's knock some people up.
[2259.60s -> 2260.60s]  These early levels, you got to build it up.
[2260.60s -> 2276.30s]  Let's go.
[2276.30s -> 2281.06s]  This is risky, but I'm doing it.
[2281.06s -> 2289.26s]  Now, you're not going to fool me with that one.
[2289.26s -> 2298.64s]  I'm the king of that move.
[2298.64s -> 2311.34s]  Whoa.
[2311.34s -> 2312.34s]  Jinda got that.
[2312.34s -> 2313.34s]  That was stupid.
[2313.34s -> 2314.34s]  That was really dumb to pick that up.
[2314.34s -> 2324.66s]  What was I thinking?
[2324.66s -> 2333.39s]  Clear it out.
[2333.39s -> 2341.05s]  Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[2341.05s -> 2357.98s]  That almost just absolutely just decimated me.
[2369.64s -> 2370.64s]  Get that shit out of here.
[2370.64s -> 2371.64s]  Get that shit out of here.
[2371.64s -> 2372.64s]  Get it out of here.
[2372.64s -> 2385.85s]  What the hell?
[2385.85s -> 2386.85s]  You just hit dad in the other room.
[2386.85s -> 2390.43s]  Dad, will you stop?
[2390.43s -> 2396.98s]  Relax.
[2396.98s -> 2402.46s]  I'm trying to study reused material.
[2402.46s -> 2404.79s]  Yeah, I know.
[2404.79s -> 2406.79s]  Big pellet freezes the red guys.
[2406.79s -> 2408.22s]  I'm learning.
[2408.22s -> 2409.66s]  I'm learning.
[2409.66s -> 2410.66s]  I'm learning.
[2410.66s -> 2416.12s]  Oh, my God.
[2416.12s -> 2417.12s]  You just joked me.
[2417.12s -> 2419.06s]  Whatever.
[2419.06s -> 2421.06s]  I, this is, I love this game.
[2421.06s -> 2428.68s]  This is a lot of fun.
[2428.68s -> 2436.22s]  What a fun game.
[2436.22s -> 2439.48s]  This is way better than the Mario one.
[2439.48s -> 2442.48s]  I played the Mario once or twice and I was just like, I don't like this.
[2442.48s -> 2452.42s]  Let's go.
[2452.42s -> 2453.73s]  Focus.
[2453.73s -> 2468.83s]  I'm just going to build up a huge train.
[2468.83s -> 2472.61s]  See if I can do that.
[2472.61s -> 2474.61s]  Am I good enough to build up a gigantic train?
[2474.61s -> 2479.14s]  Find out.
[2479.14s -> 2494.56s]  Just destroy somebody.
[2494.56s -> 2496.56s]  I'm about to fucking ruin somebody's lunch right now.
[2496.56s -> 2497.56s]  Here we go.
[2497.56s -> 2505.88s]  How do I have speed one?
[2505.88s -> 2517.46s]  When did I miss a pellet?
[2517.46s -> 2524.63s]  I'm in trouble.
[2524.63s -> 2535.41s]  All right.
[2535.41s -> 2553.74s]  Back up here.
[2553.74s -> 2555.81s]  Safety.
[2555.81s -> 2556.81s]  I need safety.
[2556.81s -> 2572.00s]  Here we go.
[2583.86s -> 2584.86s]  Why?
[2584.86s -> 2596.73s]  How do I send those to people?
[2596.73s -> 2601.27s]  This is the German that I came to see.
[2601.27s -> 2603.27s]  No, I'm not going to make those noises anymore.
[2603.27s -> 2604.27s]  I'm going to relax.
[2604.27s -> 2612.87s]  You need to put it on train.
[2612.87s -> 2617.48s]  So what happened in the beginning there?
[2617.48s -> 2621.17s]  I didn't, I didn't get the first speed increase.
[2621.17s -> 2622.17s]  Why?
[2622.17s -> 2624.56s]  What happened?
[2624.56s -> 2625.56s]  It wasn't my fault.
[2625.56s -> 2626.56s]  It's the game's fault.
[2626.56s -> 2650.78s]  The game is broken.
[2650.78s -> 2651.78s]  Let's destroy this here.
[2651.78s -> 2661.70s]  It's flying over me.
[2661.70s -> 2662.70s]  What was that?
[2662.70s -> 2692.89s]  Don't get collapsed on.
[2692.89s -> 2693.89s]  That's fine.
[2693.89s -> 2698.01s]  It's okay.
[2698.01s -> 2700.01s]  Don't worry about this because I'm going to kill everybody right here.
[2700.01s -> 2707.90s]  I didn't get everybody.
[2707.90s -> 2711.90s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2711.90s -> 2712.90s]  Okay.
[2712.90s -> 2713.90s]  I'm okay.
[2713.90s -> 2727.11s]  I'm okay.
[2727.11s -> 2740.45s]  Down.
[2740.45s -> 2741.45s]  Just get it.
[2741.45s -> 2759.07s]  Just get it.
[2759.07s -> 2771.77s]  Fuck it.
[2771.77s -> 2787.92s]  I don't need the speed.
[2787.92s -> 2799.72s]  Oh, fuck.
[2799.72s -> 2806.14s]  Watch that red.
[2806.14s -> 2807.58s]  Watch that red.
[2807.58s -> 2808.58s]  Don't fucking analog.
[2808.58s -> 2827.93s]  You piece of fucking dog shit.
[2827.93s -> 2836.66s]  Get it.
[2836.66s -> 2837.66s]  There's a.
[2838.66s -> 2839.66s]  Wow.
[2839.66s -> 2840.66s]  It was so fast.
[2840.66s -> 2852.58s]  Oh, my God.
[2852.58s -> 2853.58s]  What happened?
[2853.58s -> 2854.58s]  It was two seconds.
[2854.58s -> 2855.58s]  It wasn't even one second.
[2855.58s -> 2856.58s]  Oh, my God.
[2856.58s -> 2857.58s]  It was just like, there you go.
[2857.58s -> 2858.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[2858.58s -> 2859.58s]  Oh, my God.
[2859.58s -> 2862.17s]  It was so close.
[2862.17s -> 2863.17s]  When I grabbed the pellet, it was like, oh, a full second went by.
[2863.17s -> 2864.17s]  Shit.
[2864.17s -> 2865.17s]  You don't have to use analog.
[2865.17s -> 2869.43s]  I know, but I'm so used to it now, even though I hate it.
[2869.43s -> 2870.43s]  Damn it.
[2870.43s -> 2872.06s]  This is too much.
[2872.06s -> 2873.06s]  Oh, my God.
[2873.06s -> 2874.06s]  Oh, my God.
[2874.06s -> 2875.06s]  Oh, my God.
[2875.06s -> 2876.06s]  Oh, my God.
[2880.11s -> 2881.11s]  You don't have to use analog.
[2881.11s -> 2883.11s]  I know, but I'm so used to it now, even though I hate it.
[2883.11s -> 2896.32s]  Damn it.
[2896.32s -> 2899.75s]  This is too much fun, and I keep getting so close.
[2899.75s -> 2919.68s]  Give me all the pellets.
[2919.68s -> 2939.33s]  Watch out for this guy.
[2939.33s -> 2960.54s]  All right, let's go.
[2960.54s -> 2969.52s]  I'm going to get that other side.
[2969.52s -> 2987.59s]  Come on.
[2987.59s -> 2988.59s]  Come on.
[2988.59s -> 2999.18s]  Come on.
[2999.18s -> 3000.80s]  Come on.
[3000.80s -> 3005.88s]  Don't fuck it up here.
[3005.88s -> 3030.22s]  Get it.
[3030.22s -> 3033.38s]  I'm good.
[3033.38s -> 3034.38s]  Eat shit.
[3034.38s -> 3037.29s]  Down.
[3037.29s -> 3038.29s]  Down here, all the way around.
[3038.29s -> 3047.78s]  That was a risky move, but it was worth it.
[3047.78s -> 3050.05s]  Let's go dump this on somebody.
[3050.05s -> 3051.05s]  Shit.
[3051.05s -> 3056.58s]  I got to change the analog.
[3056.58s -> 3057.58s]  It's so bad.
[3057.58s -> 3062.66s]  It's painfully bad.
[3062.66s -> 3065.83s]  This could be the worst analog of any controller.
[3065.83s -> 3068.33s]  Didn't they just get sued for this shit?
[3068.33s -> 3071.83s]  Didn't they just lose a lawsuit about how shitty the analog was?
[3071.83s -> 3073.44s]  They did, right?
[3073.44s -> 3086.19s]  That happened, right?
[3086.19s -> 3087.19s]  Movement I want here.
[3087.19s -> 3089.58s]  How do I change this?
[3089.58s -> 3090.58s]  Turn on fucking vibration.
[3090.58s -> 3091.58s]  What is this?
[3091.58s -> 3092.58s]  1993?
[3092.58s -> 3097.89s]  Is this like 1996?
[3097.89s -> 3098.89s]  Why the fuck?
[3098.89s -> 3099.89s]  Turn it off.
[3099.89s -> 3100.89s]  Nobody uses.
[3100.89s -> 3101.89s]  Nobody cares.
[3101.89s -> 3112.09s]  All right.
[3112.09s -> 3116.14s]  Now I want to go.
[3116.14s -> 3121.74s]  What are you doing?
[3121.74s -> 3126.05s]  Movement I want.
[3126.05s -> 3127.05s]  This is strategy.
[3127.05s -> 3128.54s]  I'm so good.
[3128.54s -> 3133.28s]  This is the shittiest menu I've ever seen, by the way.
[3133.28s -> 3147.02s]  Let me fucking move.
[3147.02s -> 3149.86s]  I'm trying to move.
[3149.86s -> 3150.86s]  If you know, you know.
[3150.86s -> 3151.86s]  And you know.
[3151.86s -> 3153.66s]  A lot of you that play this game, you went to that menu and like, this menu sucks.
[3153.66s -> 3158.36s]  All right.
[3158.36s -> 3166.45s]  Let's go.
[3166.45s -> 3167.45s]  If you know, you know.
[3167.45s -> 3170.33s]  Oh, I got so close.
[3170.33s -> 3172.02s]  Okay.
[3172.02s -> 3173.02s]  New controls.
[3173.02s -> 3176.11s]  Let's see what happens.
[3176.11s -> 3177.99s]  Are we going to get two meltdown screens back to back?
[3177.99s -> 3180.19s]  No.
[3180.19s -> 3181.19s]  By the way, how many?
[3181.19s -> 3182.75s]  I said it was 10 more games, right?
[3185.15s -> 3188.55s]  No, I can't just like stream once a week and have like freakouts once a week.
[3188.55s -> 3189.55s]  I'm not.
[3189.55s -> 3191.82s]  No.
[3191.82s -> 3194.38s]  Well, that makes the game fucking easy.
[3194.38s -> 3195.82s]  This is a guaranteed win right here.
[3195.82s -> 3224.66s]  What should I have it on?
[3224.66s -> 3225.66s]  Where's the last one?
[3225.66s -> 3226.66s]  Where's the last one?
[3226.66s -> 3227.66s]  Where's the last little pellet?
[3227.66s -> 3228.66s]  I don't see one.
[3228.66s -> 3230.47s]  Where was it?
[3230.47s -> 3231.47s]  I didn't even see it.
[3231.47s -> 3244.55s]  Already got it?
[3244.55s -> 3259.04s]  Oh.
[3259.04s -> 3264.82s]  Heat it up.
[3264.82s -> 3267.47s]  This is going to be big.
[3267.47s -> 3268.47s]  Don't do that.
[3268.47s -> 3297.31s]  Got to kill that guy and the guy behind him.
[3297.31s -> 3298.95s]  This awkward movement there, but whatever.
[3298.95s -> 3303.46s]  I got it.
[3303.46s -> 3306.04s]  I'm dead.
[3306.04s -> 3307.73s]  Close.
[3308.57s -> 3309.57s]  Very close.
[3309.57s -> 3310.57s]  That was shit.
[3310.57s -> 3322.50s]  Don't make a risky move like that again.
[3322.50s -> 3324.12s]  My hand hurts.
[3324.12s -> 3325.12s]  Oh, no.
[3325.12s -> 3326.12s]  This is a bad idea.
[3326.12s -> 3327.12s]  Why did I switch from the analog?
[3327.12s -> 3337.32s]  Ah, that was risky.
[3337.32s -> 3347.01s]  I...
[3347.01s -> 3348.01s]  No!
[3348.01s -> 3349.76s]  Ah!
[3349.76s -> 3351.76s]  And you saw what fucking happened.
[3351.76s -> 3352.76s]  And I...
[3352.76s -> 3354.00s]  Oh, shit.
[3354.00s -> 3355.00s]  My hand.
[3355.00s -> 3359.01s]  That just threw me off so bad.
[3359.01s -> 3369.21s]  I have to change it back.
[3369.21s -> 3370.21s]  It actually hurts.
[3370.21s -> 3386.10s]  He's going to rage put and never play it again.
[3386.10s -> 3387.10s]  This is just...
[3387.10s -> 3389.38s]  This is just the insanity of Nintendo consoles.
[3390.34s -> 3393.52s]  This is the insanity.
[3393.52s -> 3396.64s]  No other console on Earth...
[3396.64s -> 3397.64s]  It's been almost...
[3397.64s -> 3401.84s]  It's been the last three generations of Nintendo fucking consoles.
[3401.84s -> 3408.44s]  You buy the console and then you replace the shit controller that comes with it.
[3408.44s -> 3410.50s]  No other console has this problem.
[3410.50s -> 3413.93s]  Well, just get the better controller.
[3413.93s -> 3416.33s]  So the Switch is not $249.
[3416.33s -> 3417.33s]  It's $310.
[3417.73s -> 3419.73s]  Because you got to buy the fucking pro controller.
[3419.73s -> 3435.29s]  Because it's the only fucking consoles that have this problem.
[3435.29s -> 3440.26s]  It's been like this for 25 years.
[3440.26s -> 3448.01s]  And it's crazy to me because the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube controllers were phenomenal.
[3448.01s -> 3449.53s]  They were the best controllers.
[3449.53s -> 3451.25s]  They were probably the best controllers.
[3451.25s -> 3452.25s]  Are we...
[3452.25s -> 3453.25s]  Am I wrong?
[3453.25s -> 3457.71s]  They went from making the best controllers to...
[3457.71s -> 3460.59s]  You got to buy another controller because these ones suck so bad.
[3460.59s -> 3473.31s]  What happened?
[3473.31s -> 3474.31s]  Fuck Nintendo.
[3474.31s -> 3475.31s]  Fuck the Nintendo network.
[3475.31s -> 3476.31s]  They don't have any good TV.
[3476.31s -> 3478.94s]  They don't have any good games anymore.
[3478.94s -> 3479.94s]  Mario Odyssey now.
[3479.94s -> 3486.18s]  I'm kidding.
[3486.18s -> 3487.18s]  I got to do the theme, right?
[3487.18s -> 3490.99s]  I'm like the guy that has the meltdowns once a week.
[3490.99s -> 3497.90s]  I bottle up all of my anger all week and I just lay it out on all of you guys.
[3497.90s -> 3502.30s]  Everybody that cuts me off on the highway, every time I drop a coffee on the ground,
[3502.30s -> 3503.30s]  you guys are hearing it.
[3503.30s -> 3504.30s]  This comes out once a week.
[3504.30s -> 3508.50s]  And before it was like three or four times a week and it was diluted over the course
[3508.50s -> 3509.50s]  of a week.
[3522.43s -> 3535.70s]  It's the evil mustache.
[3535.70s -> 3536.70s]  Toxic arc.
[3542.02s -> 3543.02s]  This is the one.
[3543.02s -> 3544.02s]  No more fucking around.
[3544.02s -> 3559.40s]  I'm going.
[3559.40s -> 3571.90s]  Oh dear.
[3571.90s -> 3577.22s]  That was dumb, but I did it anyways.
[3577.22s -> 3579.22s]  That was dumb, but I just did it anyways.
[3579.22s -> 3586.06s]  That guy was the guy that wasn't going to kill me.
[3586.06s -> 3598.38s]  Guarantee it.
[3598.38s -> 3609.60s]  Went up.
[3609.60s -> 3616.98s]  Down.
[3616.98s -> 3623.34s]  Round.
[3623.34s -> 3624.34s]  THE DRAWING CONS!
[3625.34s -> 3626.97s]  It's console!
[3626.97s -> 3628.97s]  It's the worst console.
[3628.97s -> 3630.97s]  It's the worst console.
[3630.97s -> 3651.50s]  They've got to make them little fucking hamburger slices.
[3651.50s -> 3653.50s]  Oh look, it's cute.
[3653.50s -> 3655.50s]  Oh, it's the switch.
[3655.50s -> 3658.50s]  Oh yeah, it fits in a baby's hand.
[3658.50s -> 3668.70s]  Collect them all.
[3668.70s -> 3670.70s]  Here's a bunch of colors.
[3670.70s -> 3695.91s]  No, I will not.
[3695.91s -> 3696.91s]  It's over.
[3696.91s -> 3697.91s]  I had to.
[3697.91s -> 3701.88s]  These actual meltdowns.
[3701.88s -> 3704.88s]  What happened to my speed increase?
[3704.88s -> 3720.70s]  No, I very much enjoy pressing all the face buttons with my one thumb.
[3721.50s -> 3723.74s]  I really love it.
[3723.74s -> 3725.37s]  It's awesome.
[3725.37s -> 3743.52s]  These things are smaller than chicklets.
[3743.52s -> 3744.52s]  Yay!
[3744.52s -> 3755.98s]  Alright, I'm out of here.
[3755.98s -> 3756.98s]  I'm done.
[3756.98s -> 3758.98s]  I am unraveling right now.
[3758.98s -> 3760.79s]  I'm unraveling.
[3760.79s -> 3762.79s]  No more unraveling, okay?
[3762.79s -> 3767.74s]  I'm going to play, and I'm going to try to get to top ten again.
[3767.74s -> 3780.22s]  Maybe this is motion controllers, Nintendo.
[3780.22s -> 3782.22s]  I'd be able to do it, right?
[3782.22s -> 3788.30s]  Put that in fucking everything.
[3788.30s -> 3790.30s]  We all wanted that ever since the Kinect.
[3799.40s -> 3803.73s]  Some streamers are like,
[3803.73s -> 3808.10s]  Oh man, I'm looking forward to going to that Nintendo mixer.
[3808.10s -> 3810.10s]  At TwitchCon, I go Nintendo.
[3810.10s -> 3811.10s]  I'm not invited to that.
[3811.10s -> 3815.10s]  I'm going to get side-eyed at every conference I go to now.
[3815.10s -> 3817.10s]  Like, right?
[3817.10s -> 3830.86s]  I'm burning every bridge in the bridge before the cement was even dry.
[3830.86s -> 3835.86s]  The work hadn't even been done on the bridge, and I'm already burning them.
[3835.86s -> 3848.81s]  Play smart.
[3848.81s -> 3855.60s]  Counter.
[3855.60s -> 3856.60s]  I don't even know how to select counter.
[3857.40s -> 3872.08s]  What did I do?
[3872.08s -> 3883.73s]  I made it out with that one.
[3883.73s -> 3896.04s]  Get off me.
[3896.04s -> 3901.38s]  Down here?
[3901.38s -> 3902.38s]  This is very risky.
[3902.38s -> 3916.78s]  I need the speed, though, otherwise I ain't making it.
[3916.78s -> 3917.78s]  Oh dear.
[3917.78s -> 3925.66s]  God.
[3925.66s -> 3931.12s]  I'm dead.
[3931.12s -> 3932.12s]  They're all coming for me.
[3932.12s -> 3935.66s]  No, it...
[3935.66s -> 3937.66s]  I spent $60 to play this game.
[3937.66s -> 3951.17s]  So you need the other controller.
[3951.17s -> 3953.17s]  I just got my microwave, my favorite one.
[3953.17s -> 3955.75s]  Could I survive there?
[3955.75s -> 3956.75s]  Well, yes.
[3956.75s -> 3961.75s]  You see, what I did was I pressed right on the Joy-Con.
[3961.75s -> 3963.75s]  What a fun name that is.
[3964.55s -> 3965.55s]  Joy-Con.
[3965.55s -> 3970.69s]  And when I pressed right, the character went down.
[3970.69s -> 3998.04s]  It's the mustache.
[3998.04s -> 3999.04s]  Peter.
[3999.04s -> 4025.22s]  Peter, it's the mustache.
[4025.22s -> 4045.46s]  Kill it.
[4045.46s -> 4049.78s]  Kill.
[4049.78s -> 4056.52s]  Pipe it.
[4056.52s -> 4073.76s]  That's enough speed.
[4073.76s -> 4075.00s]  I don't need to mind my size.
[4075.00s -> 4076.00s]  I sound so angry.
[4076.00s -> 4099.13s]  Go.
[4099.13s -> 4108.05s]  Hopefully I got it in time.
[4108.05s -> 4114.47s]  Wow.
[4114.47s -> 4116.47s]  Oh, I'm in trouble.
[4116.47s -> 4194.70s]  Yeah!
[4194.70s -> 4211.54s]  It just keeps going.
[4211.54s -> 4217.83s]  Did I win?
[4217.83s -> 4221.67s]  Oh my God.
[4221.67s -> 4222.67s]  No.
[4222.67s -> 4224.67s]  I was so close again.
[4226.22s -> 4227.22s]  Oh, no.
[4227.22s -> 4229.22s]  I was so sad.
[4229.22s -> 4233.78s]  It's like you're bringing me up to the top of the roller coaster.
[4233.78s -> 4237.78s]  It's the most intense, fun roller coaster in the world.
[4237.78s -> 4240.78s]  And then right when I get to the peak where you're about to drop me,
[4240.78s -> 4242.78s]  you hit the brakes and you say,
[4242.78s -> 4244.78s]  Sorry, the ride is closed today.
[4244.78s -> 4245.78s]  Come back tomorrow.
[4245.78s -> 4250.78s]  And I keep coming back every day and you keep stopping me right at the top.
[4250.78s -> 4253.34s]  That sucks.
[4253.34s -> 4259.94s]  No.
[4261.10s -> 4263.10s]  That's not what I'm talking about.
[4265.69s -> 4271.37s]  What the fuck?
[4275.68s -> 4276.68s]  Okay.
[4276.68s -> 4277.68s]  I have to win.
[4277.68s -> 4278.68s]  I have to win.
[4278.68s -> 4283.14s]  Please let me just beat this.
[4283.14s -> 4286.14s]  It's because everybody that's number one is just like...
[4286.14s -> 4287.14s]  They're just unbeatable.
[4287.14s -> 4290.14s]  Everyone that's number one is always just unstoppable.
[4290.14s -> 4296.54s]  God damn it.
[4296.54s -> 4297.78s]  It's too fun.
[4297.78s -> 4299.78s]  I can't stop playing it.
[4299.78s -> 4313.94s]  Okay.
[4313.94s -> 4314.94s]  Buy me some time.
[4314.94s -> 4315.94s]  Buy me some time.
[4315.94s -> 4317.94s]  There's so many on me.
[4318.74s -> 4335.94s]  I should have just grabbed it when I had a fucking chance.
[4345.43s -> 4346.43s]  I thought that was the one.
[4346.43s -> 4347.43s]  I was moving.
[4347.43s -> 4348.43s]  I was dodging.
[4348.43s -> 4350.12s]  I was moving around.
[4350.12s -> 4351.12s]  I just burped.
[4351.12s -> 4372.20s]  That was like stress burp.
[4372.20s -> 4388.65s]  That's so ridiculous.
[4388.65s -> 4397.82s]  Clear.
[4397.82s -> 4398.82s]  Paint the dots.
[4398.82s -> 4415.68s]  Paint them.
[4415.68s -> 4420.63s]  Whoa.
[4420.63s -> 4431.34s]  There it is.
[4431.34s -> 4453.26s]  Good.
[4453.26s -> 4454.26s]  Just get it.
[4454.26s -> 4462.47s]  Just get it.
[4462.47s -> 4463.47s]  Don't be an idiot.
[4463.47s -> 4466.31s]  Round town.
[4466.31s -> 4491.17s]  There it is.
[4491.17s -> 4492.17s]  Oh my God.
[4492.17s -> 4493.17s]  Turn around.
[4493.17s -> 4495.94s]  Go back.
[4495.94s -> 4496.94s]  No.
[4497.74s -> 4532.97s]  Bad spawn.
[4532.97s -> 4535.94s]  Hmm.
[4535.94s -> 4536.94s]  Ah.
[4536.94s -> 4537.94s]  Ah.
[4537.94s -> 4539.30s]  I can't get it.
[4539.30s -> 4540.30s]  Did you see that bullshit?
[4540.30s -> 4541.30s]  I couldn't go.
[4541.30s -> 4542.30s]  I couldn't.
[4542.30s -> 4561.02s]  It was touching it.
[4561.02s -> 4562.50s]  I need to calm down.
[4562.50s -> 4563.50s]  I am calm.
[4563.50s -> 4571.46s]  I just turn and just whip a glass into the back of the wall.
[4571.46s -> 4573.34s]  All right.
[4573.34s -> 4574.34s]  Ten more.
[4574.34s -> 4576.23s]  This is it.
[4576.23s -> 4578.58s]  This is one out of ten.
[4578.58s -> 4579.58s]  Ten more.
[4579.58s -> 4592.40s]  This is it.
[4592.40s -> 4611.60s]  Left that here for safety.
[4611.60s -> 4616.44s]  A huge train over there.
[4616.44s -> 4617.68s]  I'm ready to destroy it.
[4617.68s -> 4620.05s]  I'm going to do a monster train.
[4620.09s -> 4621.09s]  Ready?
[4621.09s -> 4623.10s]  Watch this one.
[4623.10s -> 4630.61s]  Ready?
[4630.61s -> 4663.91s]  That one felt good.
[4663.91s -> 4665.19s]  Going for one more clear and that's it.
[4665.19s -> 4670.72s]  Go down.
[4670.72s -> 4671.72s]  Down.
[4671.72s -> 4672.72s]  I'm good.
[4672.72s -> 4674.54s]  I'm good.
[4674.54s -> 4675.54s]  I'm good.
[4675.54s -> 4676.54s]  I'm good.
[4676.54s -> 4677.54s]  Eat them.
[4677.54s -> 4678.54s]  Eat them all.
[4678.54s -> 4682.40s]  I enjoy.
[4682.40s -> 4683.40s]  I'm having lots of joy from these things.
[4683.40s -> 4701.92s]  I get so happy when I hit a direction and I go the other way.
[4701.92s -> 4703.16s]  Um.
[4703.16s -> 4707.38s]  You guys are doing predictions every round.
[4707.38s -> 4709.81s]  That's guaranteed losing points.
[4709.81s -> 4712.60s]  I can't believe you're betting for me.
[4712.60s -> 4715.40s]  I can't believe you're betting for me.
[4715.40s -> 4722.06s]  Stat wise that's a very bad odds right now. Let's try to go through down three times
[4727.90s -> 4733.65s]  Just just just complain about things and don't like solve them even though you're in even though you're annoyed that you have to solve it
[4733.65s -> 4740.05s]  Just just keep making sure they understand the joy-con sucks Jeremy keeps saying it over and over again. Maybe they'll
[4740.77s -> 4742.77s]  Have they heard it yet? Oh
[4743.37s -> 4747.81s]  They couldn't you just just just repeat yourself a thousand times. Maybe they'll maybe they're here at one time
[4748.45s -> 4783.49s]  Load it up load it up too risky
[4784.41s -> 4801.50s]  It's a stupid move, but I have to do it
[4806.15s -> 4855.29s]  Good I'll go that way. Oh Jerry. This is gonna be big
[4877.94s -> 4907.80s]  The red thing on the left scared the shit out of me and I tried to stop betting for me you're gonna lose
[4908.44s -> 4925.23s]  Some of you guys are gonna end up with nothing left. Wait, he was for top 10. Oh
[4926.27s -> 4928.58s]  Okay in that case cool. I
[4933.90s -> 4937.70s]  Made this so stupid these the setup that I have here is so backwards
[4938.58s -> 4983.86s]  I'm teching. I'm tell let me tech first. I'm gonna I'm teching for a little while this shit out of here
[4983.86s -> 5018.98s]  Get rid of that guy go to the left move. Good move. Good move. Good move up. I just ate all those things
[5018.98s -> 5021.66s]  All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Perfect. That's actually perfect
[5048.79s -> 5160.26s]  Oh shit get over there. Don't screw me over. Just calling a pineapple. Don't do it. Where am I?
[5160.66s -> 5182.43s]  Did I win oh my god, what the fuck I just I lost track of where even was I was just surrounded by earth
[5182.43s -> 5199.16s]  There's so much shit. That's the third time. I've gotten to number two. What are they doing?
[5199.16s -> 5201.72s]  What test that guy that just went for drugs?
[5202.24s -> 5206.94s]  These can't like do drugs and they play this game so they get to first place every time
[5207.50s -> 5236.72s]  We should all of us that got into this game should have to do mandatory drug testing
[5236.72s -> 5245.89s]  So I sit there take to drop blood from all of us and then run it and see who's on drugs
[5260.66s -> 5262.82s]  Shit, I'm on drugs
[5264.10s -> 5270.28s]  No, I'm gonna get booted from the tournament
[5273.04s -> 5285.54s]  No, no, I know what I meant to say was only performance enhancing drugs
[5286.18s -> 5294.18s]  That's what I meant to say
[5294.34s -> 5310.91s]  That makes you like be able to like lightning reflect. It's me
[5313.31s -> 5340.62s]  Play like the curb your enthusiasm music. Oh dear. Oh my god
[5342.66s -> 5364.59s]  I don't even know I have to go over this way. I have really shit speed really shit speed
[5365.33s -> 5367.09s]  really shit speed
[5367.09s -> 5372.59s]  What was it supposed to do there? Nothing. I got locked in in every direction
[5372.59s -> 5379.11s]  I got I I went back like 10 games of chess in 10 seconds and I saw that I was checkmate at every single angle
[5379.83s -> 5410.83s]  Hmm. Oh shit. It's this wasn't playing Pokemon. I changed that whoops. We all know that would be impossible for you. I
[5413.54s -> 5448.54s]  I'm so close. I'm so close in another universe. I won one of those games. Let's go. Come on
[5449.06s -> 5458.31s]  That was this is a really bad start. Oh, this is a awful start. It's okay. I can make it work
[5458.89s -> 5488.29s]  Guys gotta die. Yeah, you would screw everything up. He would have and through this guy good
[5488.47s -> 5541.62s]  What does this mean when this happened? I gotta get these all before the next batch comes out. Oh shit
[5541.80s -> 5548.55s]  Don't go that way. Oh, I got trapped because the fucking
[5549.55s -> 5551.55s]  little white things I
[5552.31s -> 5555.61s]  Just had to go a little before the left and it slows you down so much
[5556.39s -> 5571.08s]  You didn't commit. Yeah, cuz I thought he was gonna beat me cuz I two of those little like white Pac-man's
[5571.88s -> 5573.88s]  like just for biting me and
[5574.88s -> 5577.12s]  Hi, I feel like I'm getting interrogated
[5577.56s -> 5598.92s]  What happened? He's alive. Let's go. I'm obsessed with this game. I just can't stop playing it
[5599.48s -> 5602.80s]  Because it's just that these dumb battle royale games
[5602.80s -> 5607.36s]  I know why they're so popular now doesn't matter if it's Pac-man fortnight pub G
[5607.68s -> 5609.68s]  They dangle a carrot in front of your face
[5610.08s -> 5611.60s]  forever
[5611.60s -> 5615.20s]  Chances are for the most part you're not gonna come in first place
[5615.20s -> 5619.90s]  You are not gonna be in first place ever it might not even ever happen one fucking time
[5620.44s -> 5644.90s]  But the carrot is just here. It's just dangling permanently in front of your face. I gotta clear these guys out
[5645.62s -> 5664.47s]  There my grandma come out this way. All right now go
[5692.66s -> 5706.62s]  Very risky, but I'm gonna do it for it. All right. I don't care about speed anymore. I don't I really don't
[5707.14s -> 5715.08s]  If I can get it, I get it if I can I can
[5741.14s -> 5799.91s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. This joy con. I'm in dead. Ah
[5800.55s -> 5816.61s]  I couldn't go that way. I couldn't go to the right. I couldn't go to the right
[5816.61s -> 5820.25s]  It was too blocked off and I couldn't I should have saved the pellet on the left side
[5820.77s -> 5823.78s]  I'm never gonna win the carrot will be there forever
[5826.21s -> 5831.66s]  Oh
[5831.66s -> 5833.86s]  Number two, it's so close
[5835.66s -> 5842.74s]  They consider getting the Nintendo switch pro controller I
[5843.26s -> 5849.62s]  Can't wait for the next Nintendo controller. It's an IV bag
[5849.86s -> 5867.33s]  That's gonna be real fun. And like when you shimmy in your seat
[5868.19s -> 5871.43s]  You can like move your character around so it's incredibly innovative
[5898.78s -> 5903.41s]  And the IVs in your arm and it's given I don't know like Nintendo slash
[5904.11s -> 5908.35s]  Nintendo, you know, and you fucking fuck me up. I was trying to explain myself
[5909.03s -> 5913.73s]  All right. I'm done after three more. I'm literally running out of this. I'm running out of my office
[5913.73s -> 5915.73s]  I'm sprinting as fast I can after three more
[5916.09s -> 5930.00s]  Okay, silver is gonna be more valuable than gold. Anyways, we're like two decades. I don't care about getting the gold. I got silver
[5930.60s -> 5981.85s]  That cherry, let's go. Come on
[5982.25s -> 6018.10s]  Let's make a train. It was sloppy. It was really sloppy. I'm not happy with this
[6018.78s -> 6022.82s]  Not happy with this at all. I can't I'm not gonna get this. I gotta go back around. I have to get it
[6023.46s -> 6025.64s]  I'm not happy about that. That was sloppy
[6026.00s -> 6028.43s]  Now I'm not gonna get the speed boost
[6033.54s -> 6093.66s]  Where am I going? Where am I? I got to kill these guys. Are they gonna make my life a living hell joy con?
[6094.54s -> 6138.62s]  joy con
[6139.62s -> 6157.91s]  Yeah, I was playing really well at the end there and they were just too many good players
[6158.23s -> 6168.34s]  Anybody else also feel like a lot of times you press I know. Okay. I just felt all your eyes
[6169.06s -> 6170.66s]  Rolling into the back of your head
[6170.66s -> 6178.17s]  if you guys ever like use the joy cons and you press buttons on the joy cons and they it doesn't do anything
[6178.65s -> 6183.04s]  It's almost like the wireless technology in these things is from like
[6184.20s -> 6198.98s]  2003
[6199.18s -> 6200.86s]  Please correct me if I'm out of my mind
[6200.90s -> 6202.30s]  I don't think I am
[6202.30s -> 6226.94s]  Shitty carpenter blames his joy cons
[6227.22s -> 6232.88s]  No a shitty carpenter blames his joy cons until the company that makes the joy cons gets sued
[6233.40s -> 6236.00s]  Loses a lawsuit based on how bad the tools are
[6236.68s -> 6255.61s]  That what you meant to say?
[6255.77s -> 6257.77s]  I'm not doing I
[6261.83s -> 6265.37s]  Didn't play well in pac-man a pac-man. I didn't have any good games
[6265.37s -> 6267.37s]  I
[6276.00s -> 6297.61s]  Didn't even get the speed boost. Oh imagine how stupid that would be hate these fucking things
[6304.80s -> 6306.80s]  It's making me laugh I can't play
[6307.12s -> 6314.77s]  I'm trying to focus. It's so hard to focus when you're thinking about like it. I got it. I got it. I'm fine
[6315.23s -> 6322.95s]  You have to be over there. Why do you have to be over there?
[6329.56s -> 6330.76s]  Okay
[6330.76s -> 6390.68s]  I'm only at three speed. This is awful. I have to commit right now. Oh my god
[6400.43s -> 6417.34s]  I don't have anything left. No, I couldn't I keep thinking about like this
[6418.22s -> 6427.16s]  What would I work a homeland is somebody correct me here? What actually happened with the joy cons?
[6427.60s -> 6429.60s]  It's somebody like what?
[6429.96s -> 6435.08s]  Didn't did they get they had to like do something. What did Nintendo have to do? What happened? Tell me what happened
[6435.40s -> 6457.20s]  Was joycon drift and who like called him out on it. Did they actually like go to court for this you did?
[6472.77s -> 6474.95s]  Jail
[6475.99s -> 6478.81s]  Nintendo oh that would happen. That's what happened
[6488.85s -> 6491.09s]  You guys are fucking hilarious
[6492.87s -> 6497.35s]  Shale
[6503.61s -> 6506.37s]  All right, I'm done after this one I'm getting like crazy
[6507.05s -> 6512.55s]  Get your shit together. I am fine. Look at I'm number 63 out of a hundred. Oh
[6513.15s -> 6533.08s]  My god, that's so funny. Now. Let me clear the record. I I love Nintendo. I think they're a fantastic company
[6533.76s -> 6538.11s]  They just need to hire a new guy to make the controllers
[6538.69s -> 6542.40s]  This is like three consoles in a row
[6543.04s -> 6558.17s]  Least to
[6558.17s -> 6560.17s]  Backtracking I'm not backtracking. I
[6560.77s -> 6564.77s]  Would I'm literally playing in front of you right now. I'm playing the Nintendo switch in front of you right now
[6565.77s -> 6570.16s]  Right drop kick this out the window if I like thought I it wasn't a good console
[6570.92s -> 6573.61s]  That's called bad spawns and that's called
[6574.13s -> 6576.01s]  I'm gonna punt it out the window
[6576.01s -> 6589.20s]  Am I doing the two red spawned in the two places I could go I was screwed
[6589.96s -> 6606.90s]  This is the actually last one. This game's a lot fun. I love this game. I love this console
[6606.90s -> 6614.77s]  It's a great console sure you buy every accessory fucking need it
[6637.00s -> 6641.74s]  It's in my brain and just won't go away
[6650.77s -> 6654.77s]  It's got me it's got me I can't help it it's got me I can't stop
[6655.45s -> 6665.72s]  What the hell is what this skip bullshit get out of here?
[6666.56s -> 6672.71s]  That's quite a combo, but I don't care
[6673.35s -> 6680.77s]  You are you having a giggle? I am. Oh
[6682.31s -> 6686.99s]  That's bad. That's bad. All right. No, that's the list the last one. I'm not looking at chat
[6686.99s -> 6689.43s]  I'm not gonna laugh at people talking about how like okay
[6689.95s -> 6694.36s]  All right, this is it. This is the end
[6695.04s -> 6702.93s]  The end of the stream right here. My voice is a horse. What the fuck? All right. This is the end right here
[6702.93s -> 6782.92s]  This is the final one. Somebody's called me a fucking crackhead. This is the one. Let's be real closer
[6783.60s -> 6785.04s]  to be the one
[6785.04s -> 6831.99s]  Fuck I didn't want to pick that up. Yeah, that's bad. We're good save
[6858.19s -> 6908.97s]  Right
[6908.97s -> 6910.05s]  that
[6910.05s -> 6914.99s]  Yeah, I got caught up because I'm gonna blame the joy con again
[6914.99s -> 6920.28s]  I couldn't go to the left when I wanted to go left. I was desperately trying to push it
[6920.28s -> 6937.77s]  I was trying so hard now. This is the last one these things are so bad
[6938.33s -> 6952.56s]  These things these things are designed to high-five people in fucking Mario Party not to play video games with what were they thinking?
[6953.20s -> 6975.02s]  What were they thinking?
[6979.75s -> 7027.51s]  Okay, all right, this is it this no more like fucking around I'm gonna try as hard as I can good start not really though
[7028.03s -> 7040.38s]  Actually pretty bad. Not a great start
[7052.98s -> 7061.23s]  It went up on its own by the way, I didn't press up that one doesn't count that one
[7061.23s -> 7077.15s]  This is the last one that one is now
[7077.15s -> 7080.71s]  Refund this is not steam. I've been playing like two straight hours
[7112.27s -> 7120.44s]  Fuck this was somebody's first frame shit
[7120.72s -> 7121.92s]  Um
[7121.92s -> 7126.64s]  And I like break up a friendship an hour ago, I'm sorry about that
[7127.20s -> 7157.88s]  All right, almost done. Give me the speed. I need it
[7158.48s -> 7196.72s]  Good good. I gotta go up and around when I get there in time. Oh
[7197.32s -> 7199.32s]  It's gonna be rotten
[7199.92s -> 7203.88s]  It's gonna be rotten by the time I get there. It's gonna be rotten good
[7204.52s -> 7225.06s]  Go down
[7225.06s -> 7227.06s]  so
[7227.38s -> 7252.44s]  It's actually the last one this is truly the final one before I bite this analog off with my teeth and
[7253.79s -> 7274.14s]  Spit it into the camera
[7278.33s -> 7282.87s]  Fucking idiot Jesus Christ who decided to make the stupid yellow fucking circle the protagonist of a game
[7282.97s -> 7285.21s]  It never even listens to simple goddamn instructions
[7285.21s -> 7290.37s]  He would rather die than function according to his unintended was intended fucking purpose. There's a reason he's piss-colored
[7290.93s -> 7293.79s]  He's a giant piss ball that everyone should hate fuck Pac-Man
[7294.35s -> 7327.05s]  Don't count. No, I was reading check. Let's go early the end. This is it
[7327.75s -> 7331.42s]  No matter what happens. I can lose right now. I can lose right now
[7332.26s -> 7413.24s]  Build it up all of them this way eat them. Make sure they can't kill you
[7414.14s -> 7423.49s]  God
[7425.13s -> 7461.94s]  No more speed don't care just going for clear pressing down. Why am I going to slow?
[7462.58s -> 7506.94s]  God damn it. I just didn't fucking commit because the red was behind me
[7507.26s -> 7518.86s]  Give it second place like four times. Ha ha ha
[7519.30s -> 7552.64s]  I'm gonna we're gonna run the credit in the background. No, um, this last one. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's good. Everything's fine
[7552.64s -> 7575.77s]  I I hate this but I love this game so much. I can't help it. Okay, it calls me a crack at
[7576.19s -> 7597.90s]  They weren't kidding either. They were like mad. I'm sorry. I tried to go
[7597.90s -> 7602.46s]  I just tried to go up four times in a row. I couldn't go up. It wouldn't let me I tried
[7603.26s -> 7640.46s]  Terrible route I still did it. I still got what I wanted bad route, but I feel like it's getting worse
[7640.46s -> 7648.02s]  I feel like it's happening like 40% of the time. I try to move in a direction. I think it's getting worse
[7648.02s -> 7650.02s]  This is getting worse. I
[7650.02s -> 7716.64s]  Have enough time to get these before they come over here. I'll get collapsed on. Oh, come on. What's with that spawn?
[7716.64s -> 7718.64s]  Are you out of your mind? What the hell?
[7719.24s -> 7737.14s]  Dude, it put it right in front of me. If I play another one after this, I'm gonna delete my twitch channel
[7737.14s -> 7749.66s]  Okay, if I do another one after this I will delete my account on twitch if I play another one after this
[7749.66s -> 7818.32s]  I will delete my account really dumb way to do that. But I did it. Anyways, please get him
[7819.16s -> 7826.71s]  It was a good run. I'm fine
[7827.03s -> 7899.50s]  We go. Come on. I can get one more boost fuck out of the way get out of the way
[7899.50s -> 7957.18s]  Oh you give me a fruit. Give me a fruit God
[7958.46s -> 7969.77s]  It's blocked on all sides. It's blocked
[7997.90s -> 7999.90s]  Oh

[8109.30s -> 8128.78s]  I'm sorry. I'm just kidding. No, I love my switch. It's a great console. I just want to stomp on the Joy-Cons

[8203.38s -> 8209.00s]  So I you don't have to do that if you don't want to stay subbed
[8209.00s -> 8212.00s]  You don't have to you can just drop it right now if you really want to
[8212.72s -> 8218.90s]  I don't want people to have to think that they need to keep paying this stream
[8219.06s -> 8236.78s]  $5 a month like four streams a month. So you appreciate it. Nonetheless, have a great night. Have a great week
