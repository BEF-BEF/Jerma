[0.31s -> 15.00s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Fistful of Frags gameplay commentary.
[15.00s -> 18.60s]  Fistful of Frags, what are you talking about? What's this game? What is Fistful of Frags?
[18.60s -> 26.17s]  It's the title of this game. It's the actual title of this Western Source Engine shooter from the video from a couple days ago.
[26.17s -> 30.66s]  And the reason why I'm making this video, this is a follow-up to that video.
[30.66s -> 36.83s]  I wanted to show some good gameplay of me playing this game and talk about it a little bit more in depth.
[37.03s -> 42.41s]  Collect my thoughts a little bit rather than just like throw knives at people and stuff and this is that video.
[42.41s -> 47.55s]  So Fistful of Frags, I'm just gonna very, very bluntly say this.
[47.55s -> 53.13s]  Although this game was originally released years ago as a Half-Life 2 mod,
[53.13s -> 57.73s]  this port to the Source Engine and this final release, I'm gonna put in quotes,
[57.73s -> 66.23s]  is one of the most fun, most satisfying first-person shooter experiences I've had in like five years.
[66.63s -> 73.63s]  That's a pretty ridiculous statement considering the amount of AAA first-person shooters that have come out in the last few years.
[73.63s -> 77.80s]  And there's not even a whole lot of content in this game right now.
[77.80s -> 83.60s]  Apparently the developer is gonna add a bunch of stuff later on, but I don't know how.
[83.60s -> 89.20s]  The game's free. This is a free game. There's no things to buy at the moment.
[89.20s -> 94.60s]  It's just a free download and you can play it for free. There's no strings attached.
[94.60s -> 100.60s]  It's unbelievable that this game is as free as it is and I'm having as much fun in it as I am.
[100.60s -> 105.90s]  And yes, the game is rough around the edges. Yes, the game is a little sloppy in some regards,
[105.90s -> 110.80s]  but at the same time, I think that's what gives it a little bit of charm as well.
[110.80s -> 115.40s]  The sort of strange physics that happen when you drop a dynamite on somebody's feet,
[115.40s -> 118.40s]  the strange sort of voice lines that people have,
[119.00s -> 123.60s]  Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass a whiskey. I like it. I like charm.
[123.60s -> 129.10s]  If a game has charm, I will probably enjoy it. I will probably like it more than a game
[129.10s -> 138.24s]  that's your typical spray and pray, hold the button down, military shooters that we've become very used to in the last decade.
[138.24s -> 143.44s]  And that's why I love TF2 so much. Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that was just so off the beaten path.
[143.44s -> 149.04s]  It was just so crazy to me. I just had so much charm. It was just blistering with style.
[149.04s -> 153.44s]  I had to love it and I had to play it and it's become one of my favorite games of all time.
[153.44s -> 158.62s]  Now this game is sort of in that same category. It's not your typical shooter.
[158.62s -> 165.42s]  When was the last Western FPS, not third person, because of course Red Dead Redemption would take that role.
[165.42s -> 169.66s]  But when was the last first person shooter Western themed multiplayer game?
[169.66s -> 174.46s]  There's like maybe five that have ever come out in the history of video games.
[174.46s -> 179.66s]  I can't think of any. I can think of maybe one or two that came out a long time ago.
[179.66s -> 183.80s]  But recent, in the last 10 years, this is one of the only ones.
[183.80s -> 187.00s]  And it's pretty good, as you can tell by the tone of my voice.
[187.00s -> 192.80s]  And I've done two videos in a row on this game so far, which I don't know when the last time I did that.
[192.80s -> 194.64s]  Can you guys think of the last time?
[194.64s -> 197.64s]  Now here's a good indication of how much fun I've been having.
[197.64s -> 200.81s]  I've put probably five hours so far into the game total.
[200.81s -> 208.01s]  When was the last time I made a video about a game and then like immediately made another video about that same game?
[208.01s -> 210.57s]  Talking about how good it is. I don't know.
[210.57s -> 216.58s]  You got Team Fortress 2 and like Super Meat Boy, like some of the only ones.
[216.58s -> 219.78s]  So you can tell I like this game. This is not just bullshit.
[219.78s -> 225.22s]  I'm not bullshitting you that this is a good game because I think it really is.
[225.22s -> 230.42s]  And I just wanted to hammer that point home to you guys, especially those that were on the fence of even downloading it.
[230.42s -> 234.62s]  Maybe it looks kind of crappy. I don't know. This kind of looks like a shitty game.
[234.62s -> 236.82s]  Don't let the looks deceive you.
[236.82s -> 242.42s]  If you're into very high skill ceiling, you know, landing shots, throwing projectiles.
[242.42s -> 249.46s]  If you're into that type of stuff, you're going to really be into the high risk versus the high reward that this game gives.
[249.46s -> 252.26s]  Yes, it can be wonky. Yes, it can be sloppy.
[252.26s -> 254.86s]  But still, it's got that flavor to it.
[254.86s -> 257.86s]  When you get that bang, you get that nice shot on somebody.
[257.86s -> 261.26s]  You throw that tomahawk across the map and it hits somebody in the face.
[261.26s -> 264.26s]  It's got a lot of awesome stuff that you can do in it.
[264.26s -> 272.46s]  And I would say at least give it a try. At least jump into it for an hour or so and grab some buddies and just go into the old west and just start gunslinging.
[272.46s -> 276.49s]  That's my my advice to those that want to check it out.
[276.49s -> 285.09s]  And to wrap this video up, I'm going to say for the next minute or so long live the modding community, long live modders.
[285.09s -> 293.73s]  And if you're a game developer and you don't want to support modders and you think that modding is stupid or bad or ruins your game,
[293.73s -> 302.10s]  you better talk to a handful of people because not only is this a original a mod of Half-Life 2, which grew into its own shoes here,
[302.10s -> 308.67s]  Team Fortress was a mod of a game. DayZ is a mod of a game originally.
[308.67s -> 311.05s]  Counter-Strike was a mod of a game.
[311.05s -> 317.92s]  Dota, Defense of the Ancients, one of the most popular things on planet Earth in gaming.
[317.92s -> 322.35s]  Dota, League of Legends, was started as a mod.
[322.35s -> 327.19s]  So Mike, this is just a standalone comment at the end of this video.
[327.19s -> 332.19s]  And I've made this video. I've talked about mods before in an entire video.
[332.19s -> 335.99s]  So I don't really need to go into that much more detail besides the sentence I just said.
[335.99s -> 341.59s]  But it needs to be noted that some of the most popular franchises were started as a mod.
[341.59s -> 346.43s]  And who knows, this one could take off, it might not, but if it does, cool.
[346.43s -> 349.03s]  And that's pretty much all I got to say.
[349.03s -> 353.83s]  But yes, guys, Fistful of Frags, free on Steam, free, free, free, free, free, 100% free.
[353.83s -> 355.03s]  It's a lot of fun.
[355.03s -> 356.63s]  I'd go get it.
[356.63s -> 357.83s]  And that's pretty much it.
[357.83s -> 359.23s]  And host a server too.
[359.23s -> 360.43s]  I forgot to mention this.
[360.43s -> 364.83s]  This game is in dire need of dedicated servers because of so many people are starting to play it.
[364.83s -> 370.23s]  So if you have a server capabilities, if you make servers, if you run a bunch of servers,
[370.23s -> 374.83s]  maybe think about making one for Fistful of Frags because I'm thinking about doing it as well.
[374.83s -> 377.23s]  I'm not sure if that will be this week or next week or something.
[377.23s -> 379.83s]  I need to iron up the details, but I will let you guys know regardless.
[379.83s -> 381.43s]  And that's going to wrap up the video. Thanks for watching.
[381.43s -> 382.63s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[382.63s -> 391.22s]  And of course, take care, everyone.
[391.22s -> 392.02s]  Pass or whiskey?
