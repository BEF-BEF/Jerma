[1.08s -> 12.07s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen of the Jerma nation. I'm here to address you guys and talk about a few things.
[13.64s -> 20.87s]  If you missed the pre-stream chat, we had just a little tiny little couple of bumps
[21.77s -> 28.76s]  about what we may or may not be doing today. Sorry, yeah, banana bros. You guys hear me out here?
[30.12s -> 47.24s]  A dog just barked at me. People are barking at me. Let's talk about this for a second. If you
[47.24s -> 52.62s]  didn't- if you weren't in the pre-stream chat, we had a- well, to understand what's going on now,
[52.62s -> 58.33s]  you got to understand the history. Last night, I made a bet, which was a totally just fun- just
[58.33s -> 65.62s]  for fun bet, uh, in the realm of around two and a half billion dollars with chat. And I was told
[66.42s -> 74.15s]  that if we got to pick the game today, that that debt, at least- at least 250 million dollars was
[74.15s -> 82.82s]  gonna come off that debt. And do not be mistaken, I will shave money off that debt. 100 million here,
[82.82s -> 90.26s]  500 million there. This is worth at least four to five hundred million dollars. In like joke,
[90.26s -> 96.58s]  like hilarious funny drama currency, not real United States dollars. There's already a debt
[96.58s -> 108.34s]  counter. That's hilarious. Uh, last night, in bed, I continued to laugh. I couldn't stop. Uh, I woke
[108.42s -> 116.02s]  up with like a hangover this morning. I was actually like humor hungover, somebody said.
[116.66s -> 124.42s]  But anyways, I was like, I'm gonna shave off some of the debt here. Just a lot of debt. Uh, so I was
[124.42s -> 130.81s]  like, let's do a viewer's choice. You- whatever game anybody wants. And they chose Star Wars Legos.
[131.90s -> 142.01s]  Lego Star Wars. Didn't get here easily. It was very, very dramatic. There were like 30 polls that
[142.01s -> 151.13s]  had to be done. We eliminated Neopets. We even eliminated Doki Doki Literature Club. Can you
[151.13s -> 161.26s]  believe it? I can't. And we're stuck here. Well, I say stuck here. This game's fun, isn't it?
[164.97s -> 172.68s]  Isn't this game good? I feel people love this Lego Star Wars franchise. I've never played any of
[172.68s -> 181.42s]  these. I always skipped them. Because to me, these were the licensed, licensed video games. I never
[181.42s -> 184.70s]  gave them a chance. Because when you have a licensed video game already, it's like, okay,
[184.70s -> 189.10s]  this might be dog shit. But then when you have a licensed, licensed video game,
[190.65s -> 199.37s]  that's where you lose me a little bit. I'm not sure. It's good. Okay. They're so good.
[201.78s -> 207.06s]  Recount. We already did a recount. Because I put a few games up there that I was like, oh,
[207.06s -> 213.11s]  how about we play these ones, guys? And then everyone freaked out. It was- if you just came
[213.11s -> 216.79s]  to the stream right now, I've been sitting in this chair for like an hour and 10 minutes.
[217.82s -> 224.04s]  Just debating with chat back and forth. And like trying to quell the uprising. It's been like a
[224.04s -> 236.50s]  full hour. Why didn't you tell anyone? Because this is important. Pre-stream chat has a lot of
[236.50s -> 246.14s]  power. And it's a lot of people. It's like a thousand people. Pre-stream chat decides a lot
[246.14s -> 259.05s]  of things. They do. Now do another recount. It's like 500 people. No, it's like 10,000 people.
[262.76s -> 270.66s]  But anyways, yes, today we're going to play Lego Star Wars. I hope these are fun. Because if not,
[270.66s -> 276.87s]  then we have to pivot to signal simulator. And if we have to pivot again, we're pivoting to my
[276.87s -> 284.23s]  choice, which is the Black Masses. It's like a medieval 5,000 people on the screen first person
[284.23s -> 296.76s]  game. So there's a tiered amount of options here over the next few days, over the next week.
[299.21s -> 308.02s]  I'm a new viewer. Can I get a song? Hey, sup. Hey, sup. I don't know what your name was.
[311.34s -> 317.37s]  I was so desperately reaching to say your name after hey. It was like, hey, fuck, what was his
[317.37s -> 325.74s]  name? I don't know. I was trying so hard. Okay, here we go. I don't- we're going to start- this
[325.74s -> 330.06s]  is the complete saga. There's like 12 games in this. I'm only going to play- I don't think
[330.06s -> 335.14s]  I'm going to play this again. I want to make that really clear to a shitload of people here.
[335.14s -> 341.48s]  I don't think this is going to be a thing that you can expect to see on this channel all the time.
[341.48s -> 348.84s]  By the way, see you in hell when I get this whole stream removed. Can I turn off the-
[348.84s -> 361.16s]  should I like mess with the music? What if I just fuck with it? Does that count?
[362.10s -> 365.74s]  All right, go, go, go, go, go before I get in trouble. New game.
[371.14s -> 377.59s]  F2. I try to play with two people at the same time on keyboard. All right, hold on. Wait,
[378.63s -> 390.46s]  the audio is so low. Are we in a bar? Let's turn it up. Okay, so who am I? I'm a big Star Wars fan,
[390.46s -> 395.02s]  so I don't want to mess this up. This is Qui-Gon Jinn, and that's Obi-Wan Kenobi,
[396.98s -> 404.95s]  and that's Megamind. I just- wait, you can- I just killed a guy. I just killed a guy.
[406.01s -> 414.12s]  Who are these people? Are we in a bar? Holy shit, what am I doing? Zero percent?
[416.84s -> 424.86s]  What? What? What's happening? Why am I killing all these people? How do I- how do I do the
[424.86s -> 439.99s]  tutorial? Holy shit, Qui-Gon's dead. What was I supposed to do? One minute. Okay, you can't kill
[439.99s -> 452.94s]  the band. How do I do anything? Qui-Gon Jinn. Holy shit, that was cool. It's the hub world. Oh,
[452.94s -> 458.14s]  all right, all right, hub world. What do I- oh, I can force grab. This is actually kind of cool.
[458.78s -> 474.01s]  Just go to the door? Oh, okay. Episode one, the Phantom Menace. Oh, cool. Wait, what is all this?
[474.65s -> 488.02s]  I'm so glad I don't have to do this puzzle on my own. Oh, sick. Okay, I got a heart piece and a
[488.02s -> 499.46s]  coin. I have 1,100 coins. Oh, did I just go into the Phantom Menace? Why are we in, like, another
[500.34s -> 510.66s]  cafeteria? They're called studs. I don't know the Lego-Lingo. The last time I used Legos was
[510.66s -> 515.06s]  probably, I don't know, 100 years ago? Phantom- okay, chapter one, negotiations. Here we go.
[517.11s -> 527.70s]  Story. Yeah. No, stop! Turn that off. Turn it down. I can't turn it off. Yeah, I can. Okay, Phantom
[527.70s -> 537.80s]  Menace, chapter one, negotiations. Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic with a
[537.80s -> 543.24s]  blockade of deadly battleships. The Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the
[543.24s -> 551.30s]  small planet of Naboo. The Supreme- this isn't the same without this, is it? The Supreme Chancellor
[551.30s -> 563.67s]  has secretly dispatched Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to settle the conflict.
[563.67s -> 576.49s]  All right, we're good. Dude, you- I can't hide a DMCA from that. That initial- my channel's gone.
[576.49s -> 586.25s]  Like, all it needs is that first- they have that exact algorithm in place. Is this voice acted?
[586.25s -> 593.70s]  Are they silent protagonists? Wait, why was C-3PO just not textured? He was not even-
[593.70s -> 599.96s]  he wasn't colored in. Isn't he gold? Oh, that took me all morning to make!
[601.78s -> 611.26s]  At least those guys are dead. What? Walk- what? Walk up to friendly characters and press Y to
[611.26s -> 621.10s]  take control of them. Oh, shit, you can, like, mind jump? Jedi mind jumping. Okay, I'm gonna be
[621.10s -> 632.36s]  honest. I'm more of a- I'm more of an Obi-Wan guy than I am a Qui-Gon Jinn guy. That's a fake fan.
[632.36s -> 641.29s]  How am I a fake fan? Is that, like, Obi-Wan more than Qui-Gon? What's the point of collecting- is
[641.29s -> 650.42s]  there- all right, is there a reason to collect these? That's a Reddit take. How is that a Reddit
[650.42s -> 654.98s]  take? Because I like- Obi-Wan's a classic character. What are you talking about? Wait.
[655.70s -> 668.49s]  All right, let me out. Qui-Gon, how do we open the door? This is a double jump. Jedi mind grab.
[668.49s -> 679.32s]  Okay, I got it. Here we go! Okay, if I was 11, this would be the most fun game I've ever played.
[679.32s -> 689.18s]  Can I throw- wait, I'm putting it back together again. That's pretty cool. You missed a stud. Do
[689.18s -> 698.63s]  I really care? Get the blue or- all right, all right, I'll get the blue. How do I block? Okay,
[698.63s -> 703.19s]  I'm gonna be very, very honest with you. This feels very strange without any other sound effects
[703.19s -> 711.53s]  besides music and lightsaber sounds. This makes these guys psycho. This is terrifying.
[722.20s -> 727.69s]  Well, pepe D. Wait, so this is just one of those games where you walk around and just touch things
[727.69s -> 732.09s]  and let them play their funny little- oh, look, a point and click adventure. I clicked on the shoe
[732.09s -> 747.11s]  and it went- no. Not even, like, any attack sounds? Silent protagonist Jedi. I don't like it.
[753.75s -> 760.42s]  Rip Vod. I don't- okay, look. Where- I gotta ask that question. This is an important question
[760.42s -> 768.49s]  for twitch.tv's lawyers. What- where's the line? Can I play Jedi Star Wars on stream if, like,
[768.49s -> 781.72s]  there's a Jedi sound effect? Can I play this? Am I not allowed to play this? No, I definitely am.
[781.72s -> 786.60s]  This is in the context of playing the video game. I'm not- I'm not showing you guys, like,
[786.60s -> 792.20s]  my favorite Star Wars soundtrack. Okay, I can understand how people think this is fun.
[792.84s -> 795.56s]  Everyone of these little buttons has toys in it and you just collect them.
[801.34s -> 810.74s]  Press every button. Wait, what's this? I can be C-3PO? C-3PO, answer the call. He's trying to call
[810.74s -> 816.22s]  us. All right, I gotta stop treating this like you guys are 10 years old. C-3PO is trying to call us.
[816.22s -> 832.78s]  Hello? C-3PO. He's not there. Guys, I hope he's not in prison or anything. Who's behind this door?
[833.42s -> 853.43s]  Oh, I don't know. Bad guys. Bad guys, alert. Watch out. C-3PO. Okay. Just kill this- oh, mini-boss.
[853.99s -> 862.25s]  Don't you guys think it's fun whenever, like, there's like a kid in the room and you're playing
[862.25s -> 867.61s]  a video game and you're, like, clearly killing people? You have to say, oh, yeah, I gotta get
[867.61s -> 887.75s]  the bad guys. That means I'm killing people. Oh, bad guys, get the bad guys. Oops. R2. Bad guy down.
[890.06s -> 901.51s]  There is this C-3PO. So, if I fill that meter in the top, what does it do? You're a fake fan.
[902.31s -> 911.62s]  Can't wait to use get the bad guy. I don't know, when I play, like, an FPS game and I, like,
[911.62s -> 920.78s]  shotgun somebody right, like, in the face. Oh, I got the bad guy. Oh, C-3PO. Oh, wait, C-3PO
[920.78s -> 933.46s]  can open the C-3PO doors. Droids can operate Lego panels. Press B to activate them. R2. Press B.
[934.57s -> 951.38s]  B. Oh, he has to go to a 3PO-only pod. It's over here. 3PO-onlies. Okay, 3PO's are allowed in here.
[951.38s -> 954.98s]  Is this regain control of your other characters by moving up to them and pressing- I don't know,
[954.98s -> 972.60s]  I want to be 3PO. I'll be Qui-gon. What am I supposed to do with this? All right, put this
[973.16s -> 981.72s]  in the- wait, what is it? It's doing it on its own. Oh, it's just doing it on its own. I did it.
[988.33s -> 995.11s]  Now move it, right? I can't- I made it too high? I don't know what the hell's going on.
[998.71s -> 1004.86s]  You can bounce. It's an optional puzzle. I don't know. I don't even know what I was doing.
[1005.82s -> 1009.50s]  Okay, you can't say like, oh, I'll bet I'll go to a little kid's game. I thought I had to, like,
[1009.50s -> 1014.63s]  move them into the lasers or something. I didn't know this was a puzzle. I didn't know what was
[1014.63s -> 1032.79s]  going on. I'm fine, look. Softlocked in a kid's game. Hey, no, stop doing the fucking Mario
[1032.79s -> 1065.75s]  backflip. All right, I actually don't get it. Toddler. Is he stoned? Stand on it. I'm back in
[1065.75s -> 1070.31s]  free play. Wait, I can't- there's a wall. I know there's a wall over there, but I can't- but do I-
[1071.11s -> 1076.06s]  No, I'm not- I can't do anything here. Come back later. Wait, why would they make a backtracking
[1076.06s -> 1095.69s]  in a toddler game? Go in the vent. You can't go in a vent. Wrong character. Don't you have to be,
[1095.69s -> 1102.84s]  like, R2D2? Okay. Need a small character, sure. I'll go get R2. All right, where's that- where's
[1102.84s -> 1115.37s]  that guy? Where's the PO? You need to come back in free play. Oh, well, how am I supposed to know
[1115.37s -> 1125.72s]  that? All right, come on. Get in there. In the- in the back of the box said there was 120 playable
[1125.72s -> 1139.32s]  characters. Is that real? There's 120 playable characters? I feel like I'm playing The Lost
[1139.32s -> 1154.55s]  Vikings for that Blizzard game. Oh, what's this? Oh, sick. Hold on, Otto wants to leave. I tell
[1154.55s -> 1168.09s]  you what, go. He's a good dog. Run on player two. No, I'm not gonna do that right now. I actually
[1168.09s -> 1174.54s]  kind of like this. It's fun. All right, so how long is this one? How long is the Phantom Menace?
[1174.54s -> 1194.68s]  Within an hour? Two hours? 40 minutes? It's about an hour. Whoa. Watch out! 10 hours. At this pace,
[1194.68s -> 1207.34s]  10 hours. I don't- I- Press X to dodge or deflect blaster bolts. I tried to double tap. All right,
[1207.34s -> 1231.59s]  deflect. Power up ball. What did I just do? Kill this little guy. Spare no one. All right,
[1231.59s -> 1238.17s]  I gotta block it back, right? That's pretty sick if you ask me. Oops. Holy shit, I just destroyed
[1238.17s -> 1253.72s]  that guy. Watch out, Qui-Gon. Okay, we did it. Get him, get him. Come on, little brother. Do
[1253.72s -> 1258.20s]  something. This is definitely a play with your little brother game and they'll do exactly what
[1258.20s -> 1268.18s]  Qui-Gon is doing right now. They just want to see the colors. Come on, get the bad guys.
[1271.21s -> 1289.80s]  Wait, what? Okay, get the bad guys. We need an R2 unit. Fuck. The blue. Swore in front of the
[1289.80s -> 1310.12s]  little brother. Oh, shit. Okay, I thought that was a clone. R2 unit. Where? Get the bad guy.
[1310.84s -> 1319.77s]  Watch out! They have shields. All right. Harry, you deal with those guys. I'll turn off- I'll do
[1319.77s -> 1325.78s]  the puzzle. Fuck. I have to deal with my little brother. If I had like actual gaming, I could
[1325.78s -> 1347.61s]  actually do it. There he is. Poxic to little brother. I need to get that blue. Got it. Oh,
[1347.61s -> 1357.45s]  yeah. Two out of 10. Fucking Mega Man energy containers. Can't wait until Kit Fisto shows up.
[1357.45s -> 1373.78s]  Yeah, I'm gonna fucking slam. That's R2 in here, right? Save R2. Shields are down. Get in. Come on,
[1373.78s -> 1380.44s]  Qui-Gon. Nice. You got him. All right. Watch out. I'm gonna get- Oh, I'm over here. It's all right.
[1381.40s -> 1396.97s]  Get him. I'm gonna swing at him. Get him. Oh, nice job. You got him. Oh, Half-Life Alex puzzle.
[1397.61s -> 1404.74s]  You're losing studs. I'm losing studs. I'm fine. What does this thing mean?
[1407.93s -> 1422.23s]  I'm like sucking in C3 for you. Fuck him. Whatever. Oh, put it together. What does this do?
[1424.62s -> 1432.65s]  Oh, I don't know. This is just a cool collect-a-thon, huh?
[1434.89s -> 1445.22s]  True Jedi. I'm in True Jedi. What's that mean? All right. I dropped a red one here.
[1450.84s -> 1462.54s]  Oops. I was trying to kill that guy. Okay, so we have to turn this on. I do like that it molds it.
[1462.54s -> 1473.42s]  That's pretty cool. That's really interesting. Game mechanic. Kids. Jump the fence. Wait,
[1473.42s -> 1486.31s]  see, 3PO can't make it. He's molding. What are you talking about? All right, we need a 3PO.
[1491.53s -> 1496.38s]  I don't think you can even lose. How many lives do I have? I think I just have infinite lives.
[1496.38s -> 1509.83s]  You can't lose in this game. All right, we need to turn that thing off. Where's 3PO? 3PO. 3PO,
[1509.83s -> 1524.07s]  let's go. It's the only sound effect that they keep using. They just use it every time.
[1524.63s -> 1541.61s]  Nice Lego hair. All right, I'm going. We did it. I see 3PO. What? It could be people around us.
[1542.57s -> 1552.66s]  You could have hired somebody like me to do this for like $100. Oh my God. What the fuck is all
[1552.66s -> 1571.88s]  this? Is it all the characters? So what does True Jedi mean? I've never played them before.
[1573.18s -> 1584.07s]  Mini kit. Can I build my own stuff? There's 160 levels. Oh, I don't know what the... I feel like
[1584.07s -> 1587.51s]  I'm getting iPadded here where they're like giving me like unlocks and level ups to things
[1587.51s -> 1593.98s]  that mean nothing. You're a level 2 golden cube. It means fucking nothing. What is it? I don't get
[1600.68s -> 1612.47s]  it. Save game. You spend them on stuff. Really? This looks kind of fun. Wait, episode... Wait,
[1612.47s -> 1622.74s]  didn't we just see this? I can't turn the... Okay. Chapter 2, Invasion of Naboo. Wait, every single
[1622.74s -> 1633.98s]  one of these is a new movie? It's 150 movies. The Trade Federation has launched a full-scale attack
[1633.98s -> 1639.83s]  on the peaceful world of Naboo. Hiding aboard the landing craft, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi
[1639.91s -> 1644.95s]  have secretly hitched a ride with the invasion force. Now they must make contact with local
[1644.95s -> 1654.34s]  forces before it's too late. Did you get all that, Harry? Hey, Harry. How's your grilled cheese with
[1654.34s -> 1674.22s]  the custard crud off? It's good. Yeah. You're my little guy. Oh, no. I was going to just... No,
[1674.22s -> 1682.97s]  I want to be... No. All right. Wait. Yes. Oh, this is... Unlockable. Is this dinosaurs in this game?
[1694.98s -> 1702.87s]  Fake fan. I have not watched the prequel series since I was like 17, okay?
[1705.94s -> 1712.26s]  Look, this franchise has spanned like 50 fucking years, okay? Sorry, I don't watch these movies
[1712.26s -> 1721.59s]  start to finish every three days to keep up on who's who. I watched them when they came out like
[1721.59s -> 1731.74s]  three times and then I forgot everything. I mean, I'm going for True Jedi. Was it a camel?
[1736.12s -> 1743.37s]  That's cool. That's cute. I like that. Kids could just pick up stuff and look at things and
[1744.17s -> 1748.73s]  this is a good viewer's choice. Wipe the 2.5 billion dollar debt clean screen.
[1749.69s -> 1773.61s]  You know, I agree. Oh, Jar Jar. Jar Jar fight? Oh, none of that. Okay, never mind.
[1781.37s -> 1794.55s]  Fake fan. I just saw him run across. I don't know. No, Jar Jar does fight though, doesn't he?
[1796.86s -> 1802.58s]  Like actually like combat, right? What's wrong with the two? Oh, that was a big explosion. Get
[1802.58s -> 1813.64s]  those balls. Somebody just asked why is he doing this? Well, first of all, excuse me. This game's
[1813.64s -> 1819.48s]  like a classic and two, I was forced to to pay off a two and a half billion dollar debt to the chat.
[1820.12s -> 1844.81s]  He's gonna get run over. A wheel just like runs over Qui-Gon's head. I'm sorry. This is like a
[1844.81s -> 1851.82s]  kids game. Kids might find this stream. You think about that? This is a mature content warning
[1852.86s -> 1859.72s]  before you click on this. Why? Let go Star Wars. Just want to let you know that this is,
[1859.72s -> 1877.29s]  I could be fucked up. Um, how again? Oh, not family friendly. He can jump really high.
[1878.01s -> 1895.05s]  Do I have a lightsaber or a blaster or something? Oh, missed what? I missed something. Is he
[1895.29s -> 1905.24s]  force powers? Oh, no, it's not force sensitive. Don't worry. I am. Wait, didn't get the jewels.
[1905.88s -> 1922.58s]  It's a weird camera change. Okay, let's go. Yeah, he can jump higher, can't he?
[1923.38s -> 1936.06s]  Holy shit. All right, let's go. Miss something stream. Do you really care? It doesn't matter.
[1936.70s -> 1943.53s]  Oh, come here. Get up here. I want to use your jump ability to get these. Yeah, a lot.
[1944.25s -> 1953.10s]  Play the game or don't play it. There's a difference between play the game and collect
[1953.10s -> 1966.47s]  every object in the game. Come on. Come on. Only bounty hunters can access these areas.
[1970.44s -> 1975.00s]  Wait, force grab. We got a force. I got a force grab this. Something in there.
[1975.88s -> 1987.13s]  Yep. Only bounty hunters can access this. That's fine. One stud is one dollar from the debt.

[2011.13s -> 2019.18s]  Why does he put the lightsaber away? No, I need that. I need that money. I need that money.
[2019.18s -> 2028.07s]  What the fuck is it doing? Stop spawning me. No, I need this money. Stop. Stop. I'm serious.
[2028.07s -> 2047.85s]  Okay. Switch bodies. What the hell was that? All right. I get every stud is one dollar paid
[2047.85s -> 2054.90s]  off of the debt. Come on. Hurry up. I need a lightsaber user. Come on. I need a saber user.
[2063.14s -> 2069.35s]  All right. Nice. 12. What is it? It was 12,000. Every 10K is one. Every 10K is one sub.
[2071.37s -> 2078.17s]  Excuse me? No, it's every stud is one dollar off of the fucking German national debt counter.
[2078.97s -> 2105.90s]  Lock it. Why am I not playing in co-op? I don't know. I didn't even know that existed. All right.
[2105.90s -> 2117.27s]  Let's go. Collect everything. Press F2. No. Sick. All right. The blue ones are the ones I really want
[2117.27s -> 2136.71s]  to get. I think this is like the local only. He hates Legos. I don't hate Legos. I just hate
[2136.71s -> 2151.59s]  everything they stand for. Watch this. Sick. All right. Counter's going up. That's all I care about
[2151.59s -> 2155.96s]  this stream. First it was, oh wow, I'm going to play Lego Star Wars. Now it's like, let's pay
[2155.96s -> 2175.70s]  that debt down. Oh yeah. Let's go. He hates capitalism. I told you that. I want to switch
[2175.70s -> 2190.82s]  to this guy. All right. Now move the rocks. Somebody squeeze in here. Oh shit. Hold on.
[2191.38s -> 2199.19s]  There's got to be a way I can jump up there, right? So you love capitalism.
[2199.91s -> 2217.88s]  Oh, what are you? There we are. Gold one. Sick. Somebody's gave me $50.
[2218.52s -> 2226.42s]  5,000 bits from the Zack Zuck IRL. Thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[2227.06s -> 2235.54s]  And they say that's $50. German national debt alert. Your debt may only be abolished if you
[2235.54s -> 2240.74s]  give us the one thing we want. The one thing we need, we need the German's dump truck ass emote.
[2240.82s -> 2246.26s]  You promised us five new emotes within a week. One must be the rockin' badonkadonk. Pay that
[2246.26s -> 2254.78s]  debt. Pay the debt. Okay. If I have a German like thick ass emote, that is a, that is a full
[2254.78s -> 2260.17s]  one and a half billion dollars taken off the debt. That is no, that is, that is two billion
[2260.17s -> 2270.23s]  dollars taken off the debt. And then I only owe 500 million. Well, and we'll hold on. Whatever,
[2270.79s -> 2274.87s]  whatever we have here. Is that a deal? All right. Well, first of all, I need like,
[2274.87s -> 2280.06s]  I gotta make sure I can even do that. Imagine compromising with like a chatroom about not
[2280.06s -> 2284.38s]  wanting to pay two and a half billion dollars. So you'll have a doctored footage image of your
[2284.38s -> 2289.18s]  fucking thick, huge ass that they can share and spam as a compromise. What the hell is happening?
[2290.14s -> 2302.86s]  What is going, what is this? How did I get here? I was playing, I was playing Noita last night.
[2302.86s -> 2308.01s]  What happened? All right. I gotta put this, I gotta put the thing together. There's that piece.
[2308.01s -> 2317.03s]  There's the belly. There's the head. Head on. All right. Ah, that's not it. Hold on. Take,
[2317.03s -> 2327.51s]  get, move that. Get that off. These are the legs. Move that. Where's my little brother to kill these
[2327.51s -> 2355.78s]  guys? Get these guys. Did I fuck it up? No. Take it off. Take that off. Fight. Fight. No, I don't
[2355.78s -> 2373.21s]  want to lose money. Why is that a flower from? No. Yes. So what are these cams is actually worth?
[2377.98s -> 2404.38s]  Oh, oh. What about your filters on that? And I'm available. All right. I'm taking over.
[2405.34s -> 2414.23s]  25,000 bucks dropped. The worst noise. Um, I can't click links right now with guys. This is like a
[2414.23s -> 2428.15s]  crash the game if I alt tab game. I can't, I can't do it. Not yet. Oh, this is the guy that goes.
[2431.90s -> 2438.78s]  All right. I will do this. Cutscenes in the frame in the name of anime surprised noises.
[2444.79s -> 2460.70s]  Next. Jar Jar Pinks. True Jedi. Didn't get true Jedi. Look at that stud total. That's
[2461.26s -> 2480.47s]  $60,000 off the German national debt. And I made an airplane. Not even close to two and a half billion.
[2482.01s -> 2493.75s]  Um, when I, I've done it, done with the game. Fake Jedi. Fine.
[2500.06s -> 2503.18s]  You're not going to get 500 million either. You don't know that. Hold on.
[2507.58s -> 2514.15s]  Only level three gold block. Omega level chapter three, the Phantom Menace escape from Naboo
[2516.10s -> 2521.54s]  dump truck emote. Oh, look, I have to like contact my like Twitch person and say, Hey, can I,
[2521.54s -> 2526.58s]  is it okay if I put like a doctored picture of my big fat, thick fucking ass for an emote?
[2526.58s -> 2534.87s]  I can't wait to get in an immediate within 24 hour. No reply. Um, we're escaping from Naboo
[2534.87s -> 2544.36s]  and there's people that are attacking us. Oh, this is the battle. Uh, this is going to be like
[2544.36s -> 2564.63s]  battlefront, right? It's going to end up as a global emote. That would be strange. Did they
[2564.63s -> 2572.17s]  both have brown capes? All right. Sometimes it looks off here with these suits. Did we both
[2572.17s -> 2577.37s]  order our Halloween costumes from like the party store? Like we both got the Star Wars Jedi costume.
[2590.42s -> 2600.02s]  Ooh, this level. Wait, like, can I be, who could I be? Oh, I love when there's like a
[2600.02s -> 2604.66s]  rocket launcher involved. How do you aim? All right. I like this. I like this character.
[2604.66s -> 2626.33s]  It's my favorite character so far. All right. I thought those were enemies. Come on, shoot him.
[2626.89s -> 2640.65s]  Come on. Stop hitting the lip. What the fuck? This is Padme. It's Queen Amidala. Oh, she has
[2640.65s -> 2651.02s]  a shooter too. I can't hit him. Blaster characters can grapple to other areas. Stand on the red
[2651.02s -> 2659.74s]  circles press B. Wait, I need as much money as I can get. Can't hit enemies directly. They'll
[2659.74s -> 2667.24s]  make a lot. Just wait a minute. I'm, I'm a little busy trying to collect as much national debt as I
[2667.24s -> 2680.50s]  can here. Press B right now. No, you have to be in the circle. Look. Wait, I can't, wait, can I force
[2680.50s -> 2687.91s]  push these? I can force shoot them. I need to get true Jedi on all these levels so I can
[2688.55s -> 2694.82s]  put the national debt down a little. This is going to be a real boring snooze fest of a stream.
[2697.13s -> 2711.98s]  Guy tries to collect like a hundred million dollars in Lego coins. The blue ones are the most
[2711.98s -> 2718.92s]  important. Blue ones are worth like a thousand. All right. Only collect blue ones from now on
[2718.92s -> 2728.62s]  and gold ones and get the, get white ones if they're in the area. Wait, what's this? I can
[2728.62s -> 2739.27s]  like mess with this. Purple is the most important one. I haven't seen any purples. You can buy
[2739.27s -> 2746.84s]  multipliers and get billions easy. Oh, really? Well, it's like this national debt's only going
[2746.84s -> 2776.41s]  to be available for a few hours. Ban that guy. No. VIP that guy. Do it. Right now. What else is in
[2776.41s -> 2783.02s]  here? What about that painting? Yeah, I need to be able to force grab it. I don't have any force
[2783.02s -> 2788.82s]  users in my party right now. You can push objects that have both black and yellow stripes. Does it
[2788.82s -> 2807.53s]  kill? Wait, you can slap people. Okay. That's more fun. Oh, puzzle. Also. Oh, I did it wrong.
[2807.53s -> 2826.31s]  You've never played a Lego game before. No, I haven't. All right. What does that do?
[2831.86s -> 2845.45s]  I don't know what that did. I can't push it. I can't push anything else. Can I break shit? Oh,
[2845.45s -> 2851.82s]  shit. Whoa. Wait, no, no, no, no. Get coins, coins, coins, coins, coins, coins. And I know
[2851.82s -> 2862.97s]  people saying they're not coins. Yes, they are. That's Poland. Did I just ricochet a bullet off
[2862.97s -> 2874.71s]  of the metal and hit shoot myself on the head? What a way to go. I put this back together. Can
[2874.71s -> 2899.58s]  I not? Okay. Cool. So how do I what do I do? Any more pieces? I have to come back and free play.
[2900.74s -> 2904.10s]  You know, I'm getting real sick of that word being said, I have to come back and free play
[2904.10s -> 2908.26s]  whether the developers didn't design it in a way that it could be completed without doing a secondary
[2908.26s -> 2912.34s]  playthrough to pad the length of the video game. And you guys said this is one of your favorite
[2912.34s -> 2931.56s]  games. I'm not going to stand for that. I'm not going to stand for that one. All right. If I don't
[2932.38s -> 2944.28s]  know, don't play with fire anymore. You'll burn the house down. Don't do it. Oh, nice music.
[2951.82s -> 2967.54s]  Double or nothing. Make it 50 billion. Oh, shit. I didn't even punch that person. He said a deal.
[2967.54s -> 2970.90s]  Well, you don't even know what the deal is. How could you say deal if you don't know what the deal
[2970.90s -> 2980.07s]  is? Got to come back and free play and put the windows back together. All right. Shave
[2980.71s -> 2985.19s]  10 million dollars off it if I do a really good fake sneeze. How's that? Does that sound good?
[2988.90s -> 3010.81s]  No. Oh, come on. No deal. Oh, yes. I met up with the party. I get a million. Sure. One million. All
[3010.81s -> 3023.67s]  right. This is if I do a good like fake sneeze. No, I need to like a real consensus on that. I
[3023.67s -> 3032.49s]  can't just do it. No one said that. A few of you did. A handful of you did. I've got to shoot this.
[3033.05s -> 3039.26s]  There's one, two. There's probably another one over here. Oh, wait.
[3039.98s -> 3049.06s]  What does that do? Stand on that. Oh, shit. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Guys, come back here.
[3049.70s -> 3066.81s]  Why gone? Show auto? Oh, I know I could show auto for a clean like 50 million. Wait, where are they?
[3066.81s -> 3082.54s]  You can't come up here? Why can't they not come up here? I think we've come to a good compromise
[3082.54s -> 3100.39s]  of what that actually costs. We don't negotiate with criminals. Who do you negotiate with? 25
[3100.39s -> 3116.50s]  million for auto? Really? What? Really? That's it? That's an easy 100 million. Yes. What? 20?
[3116.50s -> 3127.38s]  That's it? It's got to be more than that. No, no, I don't. No, no, no. That's got to be. Okay. 50
[3127.38s -> 3135.75s]  million. How's that sound? Hit me in the middle. 20 million? What do you mean you're going down?
[3142.17s -> 3149.43s]  30 million. All right. 30 million. I want 30 million dollars shaved off the national germadette.
[3150.07s -> 3166.76s]  Deal? Got a deal. All right. All right. We got a deal. Yes, there is a current debt tracker,
[3167.48s -> 3180.47s]  by the way. I can't believe that was made that quickly. You guys are fucking fast. We have a
[3180.47s -> 3185.91s]  deal. We have a deal. Showing auto is to erase 30 million dollars off of the national debt.
[3188.09s -> 3194.15s]  Just print more bald coin. That would be great if bald coin wasn't worthless.
[3202.42s -> 3211.59s]  By the way, it always was worthless. I created bald coin during the peak of the pumping shit
[3211.59s -> 3220.66s]  coin bubble of 2017. So you think that has any value right now? As I back in the shit
[3220.66s -> 3226.98s]  coin bubble pop of 2016, 2017, I could have had Cookie Monster as an advisor on my coin
[3226.98s -> 3245.88s]  and people would have still bought it. Show feet for 10 million. Nope. I would rather owe forever.
[3248.10s -> 3254.26s]  10 million, dude. Really? Oh, wow. 10 million. No. That erases the whole thing and I'm never
[3254.26s -> 3263.50s]  going to do that. They're getting no compromises from me for that one. No. Get that fucking shit
[3263.50s -> 3271.64s]  at it. Nope. All right. Some of you guys in the chat right now just some playing along and you
[3271.64s -> 3276.92s]  don't really care. When I said the word like, oh, show feet. Yeah. And all of a sudden you care.
[3276.92s -> 3280.60s]  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, dude. You're like, that would be good. Just to clear the whole debt, man.
[3280.60s -> 3284.82s]  Just like, yeah, it's just like, show them though. That would like clear the whole thing. Yeah,
[3284.82s -> 3287.94s]  do it. Let you like, get everybody like involved and like get about like a whole campaign about
[3287.94s -> 3296.36s]  like how we get just cleared. It's funny. Some of you guys heard the word feet and then just got
[3296.36s -> 3303.40s]  super interested in this like little game we're playing. Dude, just as a joke.
[3304.36s -> 3329.72s]  You're just doing just as a joke. Not a game. Why am I laughing? Because it's funny.
[3330.60s -> 3340.79s]  Like you don't think that that's a little humorous. How did that do? Shortcut. Nope. I
[3340.79s -> 3351.21s]  just blew it up. What does this do? Let's investigate. It was kind of worthless.
[3351.21s -> 3361.90s]  Really wasn't worth doing. This is a serious situation, Jeremy. Yeah. Well, hey, I got,
[3361.90s -> 3381.61s]  look, I got plenty of time to erase this debt. Mr. Blue. Mr. Blue stud. Where? It's despawned.
[3382.17s -> 3394.73s]  All right. What do you guys think a direct like fart into the microphone would be? All right. I
[3394.73s -> 3399.45s]  just like, like somebody with like their algorithm that like listens for the word,
[3399.45s -> 3404.01s]  like feet farts and like ass and shit. Just like, wait, I heard it. I got to join the stream.
[3413.11s -> 3426.49s]  That's extra debt. As debt. I got my fucking audio algorithm set up.
[3433.66s -> 3446.14s]  Jeremy, you're irresponsible with money. This is, wait, I get, I need to have a blue
[3446.14s -> 3472.46s]  lightsaber hit that. What? In fucking half. That's not what this is.
[3486.74s -> 3492.57s]  No, that's not what I meant. That's not what I meant. It's not what I meant. That's not what
[3492.57s -> 3503.13s]  I meant. Oh, you guys shut up. Don't say that. What's this one? I have to be a shift Lord
[3510.34s -> 3515.19s]  add debt. No, you know, I'm sorry. This is nothing we have to talk about with this.
[3516.20s -> 3520.84s]  You can't just add debt. That's not how the, I can, we can take it away, but you don't, we don't add
[3520.84s -> 3532.14s]  it unless it's very clearly specified that it's been added. No, you cannot. I have to agree to
[3532.14s -> 3546.02s]  that. Is there a fucking sprint button is interest. What's the interest rate and what's the, is it
[3546.02s -> 3565.90s]  annual? Well, how, how are you calculating interest? What's the way I, what's the APR?
[3566.46s -> 3575.51s]  2.5% per day. No, 2.5% per day of 2.5 billion is an unsurmountable amount of money that I will
[3575.51s -> 3595.61s]  never be able to erase. Oh, interest-free. That's an interest-free debt. Plus two and minus two
[3595.61s -> 3603.35s]  should decrease or increase the debt. No. Dude, do you understand how manipulated that would be?
[3604.49s -> 3607.61s]  I would never say anything funny ever again for the rest of my life.
[3608.25s -> 3623.11s]  It would use, you guys would just add it no matter what. No. I got a hundred and five thousand,
[3623.11s -> 3634.38s]  a hundred and thousand five hundred dollars. It would be 62 million dollars per day.
[3638.54s -> 3647.32s]  Oh, to the Cantina? All right, we'll after this. Moss Espapodris, Queen Amidala and her Jedi
[3647.32s -> 3654.60s]  protectors have fled Naboo heading for Ruscant. They plan to inform the Galactic Senate of the
[3654.60s -> 3660.44s]  Trade Federation invasion. However, the Royal Starship's hyperdrive is damaged in the escape
[3661.00s -> 3666.84s]  and they have been forced to land the remote planet of Tatooine for repairs where they will
[3666.84s -> 3686.46s]  meet their new Wizard of Oz party member, Luke Skywalker, his father, Anakin Skywalker. Hey,
[3686.46s -> 3696.07s]  Apollo 900 just gave fifty dollars. Thanks to the five thousand bits, add a deal and no deal emote
[3696.07s -> 3705.56s]  for a hundred million. No, that's not going to consume the stream. Oh, it's this guy. What's
[3705.56s -> 3728.04s]  his name? Oh, Waldo. Yeah. Right. What's his name? Watto. Oh, that, what's that guy's name?
[3729.37s -> 3743.02s]  Bulba. It's Bulbus, right? It's a Bulba. Jesus Christ. How do I drive? Does it just drive
[3743.02s -> 3775.05s]  automatically? How do I jump? Can I jump? Oh my God, this is too fast. Go, go, go, go, go, go,
[3775.05s -> 3802.79s]  go, go. Now this is uh, debasing. What place am I in? I don't know what that means. I have like two,
[3802.79s -> 3809.80s]  I have like two stars. Two out of three stars. Are the cops coming? Bad joke. Hey,
[3809.80s -> 3826.84s]  add it to the deck, motherfucker. How do I get over there? Oh, right. I have to go in front of
[3826.84s -> 3856.15s]  Subalba. Well, there's more than can't die. Oh, right on your ass, Subalba. Where's my like laser
[3856.15s -> 3882.46s]  shooters? Come here. No. What was the point of that? It's just Subalba and Anakin Skywalker.
[3883.26s -> 3895.61s]  When will he take the lead? Okay. You know when you're going really fast in a game or something
[3895.61s -> 3899.37s]  and you realize just how fast the sides of the screen are going and it makes you almost want
[3899.37s -> 3917.18s]  to throw up like instantly. That's happening right now. Oh, Subalba. How are you? Past. First
[3917.18s -> 3932.46s]  try. First try and a good load of money. Come on. Dead. I don't know why I thought that was,
[3932.46s -> 3940.31s]  he just looked like Dexter from Dexter's lab for a second. That's $500 taken down from the debt.
[3940.87s -> 3958.58s]  Why does R2 look like somebody put painter's tape all over him, spray painted him, took the
[3958.58s -> 3974.58s]  tape off and didn't add the detail work? No true Jedi? Oh, I'll take another $130,000 though.
[3975.22s -> 3997.14s]  Odd champ. What is the building? Oh, that's Subalba's car. All right. Somebody said go back to the
[3997.14s -> 4003.62s]  cantina. I can buy stuff at the cantina with, I'm not buying anything. I don't want anything.
[4004.81s -> 4011.82s]  I need to, this is money I have to save to deposit into the, yeah, I'm not buying anything.
[4012.46s -> 4025.43s]  If I buy something, then I lose it from the national debt. Oh, ice cream. Buy the multiplier.
[4025.43s -> 4030.34s]  Not a bad idea. Smart guy. It sounded like condescending, but it really wasn't supposed to
[4030.34s -> 4050.86s]  be. What do I buy stuff? Ooh, put this puzzle together and I get extra money. Thank you. Stop
[4050.86s -> 4061.88s]  helping him. Stop helping him. Go buy new characters. You can buy new characters? Wait,
[4061.88s -> 4065.00s]  if Yoda's available, then I don't care. I'll blow up this whole national debt for this.
[4065.72s -> 4082.89s]  What do I buy stuff? Oh, okay. Right here. 3.8%. What's this timer going? Hints. Characters.
[4082.89s -> 4089.99s]  Extras. Enter code. Gold brick story clips. Oh, no. I don't want this.
[4092.55s -> 4104.23s]  Extras. Extra toggle. Fertilizer. Disguise. Chewbacca carrying C-3PO. I don't know what
[4104.23s -> 4113.99s]  the, what is this? Characters. Bonk droid. PK droid. Battle droid. Battle droid, I want a battle droid.
[4114.63s -> 4126.65s]  Droideka. Captain Tar Pals. Boss Nass. Royal Guard. Padme. Watto. Does it sound like?
[4126.65s -> 4136.10s]  Watto. The rest of these are locked. Get gonk? All right, I got gonk. Stop spending money. All right,
[4136.10s -> 4147.26s]  hold on. Hints. Double jump and press X when in the air to do a special attack. All right,
[4147.26s -> 4163.40s]  what do I do? How do I buy the extra, how do I buy the multiplier? Where is it? Is it code?
[4164.12s -> 4176.04s]  Okay, hold on. How many letters here? One, two, three, four, six letters. Uh, Han Solo, like
[4176.04s -> 4181.72s]  Chewbacca. Um, like Luke. Saber, like lightsaber. It's gonna be some stupid Star Wars word. Um,
[4182.52s -> 4203.34s]  like a country or a planet. Um, Lando. Lando. Lando's gonna be one, right? Like Lando. L-A-N-D-O-E?
[4203.34s -> 4220.47s]  Or is it D-O? Lando. Whatever. Gold bricks. Wait, I can buy gold bricks? What's, why, what's the
[4220.47s -> 4237.48s]  point of this? What could I do with gold bricks? Buy them. But what do they do? It's fertilizer.
[4237.48s -> 4250.63s]  Invest, invest, invest. All right. Gold brick two. Okay, I got two gold bricks. And I'm gonna get
[4250.63s -> 4273.61s]  the disguise. All right, I got disguise. What do I put it on? Disguise on. Adaptive difficulty is on.
[4273.61s -> 4295.58s]  I don't even know what that means. Please read chat. VXZ123 is the code. That's cheating though.
[4296.14s -> 4302.97s]  That's cheating. Yeah, that's cheating. I can't do that. Look, if I can unlock it with money,
[4303.61s -> 4311.67s]  okay, but that's purely, that's pure cheating. I just like fucking executed that guy. Um,
[4312.47s -> 4329.32s]  all right, let's go to episode one. The Phantom Menace. Oh shit. Wait, no, this is my friend.
[4329.96s -> 4343.42s]  Pick him up. That's my, like, cube friend. Oh, he's gone. How many levels? Dude, I'm almost at the
[4343.42s -> 4350.28s]  end of the Phantom Menace. Let's go. You just airlocked that guy. He's fine.
[4369.83s -> 4373.03s]  Retake Theed Palace. Sure, I already know how the movie goes.
[4373.75s -> 4397.70s]  That's Earth. That's Texas. Oh, how come only one of the, one of those guys had it on?
[4404.79s -> 4407.43s]  All right, this is where they have the big Harry Potter shield and they throw those like
[4408.07s -> 4421.29s]  ball liquid slingshots at people. Oh, big battle. Why do they have disguises on their bow?
[4431.42s -> 4451.14s]  Looks like somebody was on the comedy tab in Pornhub. Okay, we have the comedy section here
[4451.14s -> 4473.35s]  where they put like disguises on their like penis. What possible context would that joke be in?
[4474.39s -> 4479.11s]  Those guys had the fucking, the nose and the mustache like on their crotch.
[4479.11s -> 4499.67s]  What are you talking about? The droids. The droids. I'm talking about the droids.
[4500.39s -> 4510.17s]  Oh, that's right. This is a kid's game. What I meant to say was uh,
[4510.17s -> 4520.60s]  I don't want to get any like parents to write me any letters.
[4521.40s -> 4544.46s]  So hard to add it. He's lost his mind. No, you lost your mind. Oh, R2.
[4559.94s -> 4563.86s]  You are high. I know it. You don't know anything. You don't know. You don't know anything about me.
[4564.66s -> 4576.52s]  Okay, you know, Dr. Don and Dr. Dan from Point Blank. This is Dr. Don. Small characters can
[4576.52s -> 4587.18s]  crawl through access hatches. Go in it. Press B. He is small. He can't, why can't, go on and get in there.
[4605.05s -> 4616.49s]  Small characters can crawl through the access. All right, well, let's go.
[4618.34s -> 4625.30s]  How are you smaller than him? How are you smaller than him? He's the smallest thing here.
[4647.06s -> 4660.58s]  Do something. Look at the guy with the gun. Somebody shoot somebody.
[4660.58s -> 4675.16s]  All right, we all have to stand on one. Nope. We need to, wait, what?
[4675.72s -> 4682.60s]  Was the, who, I can't, I'm not gonna say that. Was that joke worth it?
[4684.38s -> 4693.85s]  Um, hold on. I need to be somebody that shoots. All right, now somebody stand on that.
[4697.22s -> 4704.39s]  Oh, shit, it's gonna be a million. There it is. Do an, okay, acting challenge. R2D2 dying. Easy.
[4706.79s -> 4734.34s]  I think that deserves at least 10 million shaved off the national debt. Don't you think? No deal.
[4735.30s -> 4744.09s]  By the way, I had to turn and yell that into the wall because if I had done that sitting straight
[4744.09s -> 4768.04s]  in front of the microphone, a lot of you would have been injured. Honey, why did you cast your
[4768.04s -> 4776.12s]  ballot? What? I don't only have 3000 gold coins. This is stupid. Get that picture of Superman out
[4776.12s -> 4793.66s]  of here. If you peek the mic, how much? Wait, peek the mic does what? Please take a look at some of
[4793.66s -> 4798.06s]  the links. All right, I will take a moment to look at some of the links. Hopefully the game doesn't
[4798.06s -> 4805.10s]  fucking crash. 100 million to peek the mic. No, that's not worth it. I'll break, I'll break
[4805.10s -> 4820.49s]  something. Yeah, the debt counter. Right. I've seen it. What is this? New footage from Star Wars
[4820.49s -> 4832.78s]  DMCA movie? This person just made this account. This person has one follower. They just like made
[4832.78s -> 4841.30s]  this account. What do you want? What are you doing? It's wrong. It's not okay. Let's, this is
[4842.74s -> 4848.63s]  scariest fucking thing I've seen all day. I don't know. Is this a real picture? Not a real picture,
[4848.63s -> 4861.86s]  but what is this? Not a real picture, but is this a picture of somebody or is this a picture of me
[4861.86s -> 4879.64s]  that somebody fucked with? I can't even tell. All right, give me the next one. I mean, this one,
[4883.56s -> 4887.08s]  I mean, that's just, that's Watto, but it's just my, it's the thing face.
[4887.08s -> 4896.23s]  It sort of just looks like there's a brain-eating slug just pressed up into my nose, sucking my
[4896.23s -> 4908.42s]  brain out of my nose. What else you got? What about the GIF? No, fuck that GIF. I'm gonna put it on.
[4911.03s -> 4915.38s]  That's what you want. That's not what you're getting. Joe, you're a coward.
[4915.86s -> 4928.39s]  I can't. I get, no, I don't want. I can't. I can't. Dude, what the fuck?
[4935.45s -> 4973.14s]  Emote, emote, emote, a hundred million to show it. What? For real? Leave it on stream. No,
[4973.96s -> 4993.19s]  absolutely not. It was worth it. Deal is off. I showed it. This is good too. Hold on.
[4994.15s -> 5012.46s]  This is good too. 30 million for only the dogs. Sorry, but without the emote on the table,
[5012.46s -> 5021.30s]  I can't accept. I'm out. But wait, you forgot to say that you would do like in perpetuity a loan
[5021.30s -> 5025.94s]  to me, which then I have to pay back over the course of like four or five years. And then you
[5025.94s -> 5033.16s]  get a 1% royalty on every single time I ever show a picture of the dog. His deals, nobody ever takes
[5033.16s -> 5037.70s]  his deals, by the way. He's just there to kind of be in the middle and just say strange things.
[5038.26s -> 5043.66s]  No one ever takes Kevin's deals. Why can't he just say, I'll give you $200,000? Why is it always like,
[5043.66s -> 5048.38s]  I'll give you 75,000. But then I want in perpetuity royalties on top of 5% of every sale you make.
[5048.38s -> 5051.93s]  It's just, dude, just give him $75,000 and just fucking be done with it. I just don't think he
[5051.93s -> 5064.33s]  ever wants to give any money. I think he just likes to be in on the show as business. All right,
[5064.33s -> 5072.98s]  last one. Then we're going to go Barbara. I love how you like know who these are. Like these
[5072.98s -> 5082.68s]  characters. This is unrelated to the things we're talking about right now, but it's, I mean, kind of
[5082.68s -> 5099.21s]  funny. Tank. Deal 4 damage. Corrupt. Then deal 2 damage to all enemy minions. What is corrupt?
[5099.21s -> 5110.71s]  Wait, this is a real card? Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. I'll take, I'll take $100 million off.
[5110.71s -> 5127.61s]  That's a real card. All right, let's continue playing. Star Wars. Revenge of the Phantom Sith.
[5128.33s -> 5158.79s]  All right, we need R2. R2. Wait, he can shoot? R2, auto D2. Wait, are we keeping track of how
[5158.79s -> 5164.22s]  much the debt is actually being paid down? I just did, no, okay. I screamed really loud and it was
[5164.22s -> 5176.97s]  what? 10, 20 million? What was it worth? I'm gonna keep track of that. What was it? It was 20. It was
[5176.97s -> 5191.11s]  20. Do a monkey noise for another 10. That needs to be confirmed first. That's, I'm getting a lot
[5191.11s -> 5203.98s]  of no deals, so I'm not going to do that unless it's a deal. No, I'm not seeing very many deals
[5203.98s -> 5215.24s]  here. Shit, I just got shot in the air. Hit me! Don't let them all go to waste. You know, if any
[5215.24s -> 5224.44s]  other character would do anything, it would be great. Irma is dummy thick. Thanks for the
[5224.44s -> 5237.42s]  five community subs. You know, it's funny too. I've gained like 20 pounds. It's definitely gotten
[5237.42s -> 5249.66s]  way bigger. Oh my god, can I play the fucking game for a second? Just reflect. Reflect.
[5255.59s -> 5260.23s]  Fuck the fuck, dude. I'm out of money. All right, just who cares about the fountains? It's like $20.
[5261.86s -> 5268.68s]  Actually mad. Just stand in the middle of everybody and like it'll hit the other people.
[5269.40s -> 5289.93s]  Hit it!
[5297.42s -> 5300.71s]  My favorite part of that song, by the way. And it goes...
[5306.49s -> 5316.65s]  I always like fucking nod the fuck out when I see that. What if the active debt counter has a
[5316.65s -> 5327.50s]  thermometer on the screen? All right, we need someone to crawl through this. You. Come here.
[5327.50s -> 5337.88s]  Crawl through that. I go open the door. Oh shit, the only thing I had to do the whole game.
[5340.98s -> 5349.99s]  Did I do it, Obi-Wan? Did I make you proud? Surprise, Ruby. Thanks for the five community subs.
[5349.99s -> 5360.20s]  Thanks, dude. Oh, this is Anakin Skywalker. He's huge. Don't you think he would be like
[5360.20s -> 5376.62s]  three feet tall? Why is he like six feet tall? He's seven. Yeah, and Obi-Wan's like 45.
[5377.34s -> 5397.78s]  Why is he as tall as Obi-Wan? The debt, the debt, the debt. What about it?
[5398.34s -> 5410.86s]  What do you want about it? Crunchies. Stop growing at 15. What are you talking about?
[5411.50s -> 5421.18s]  The debt, the debt. I was trying to double jump across the chasm. I guess I can't do that.
[5431.93s -> 5438.89s]  Open. Open. Oh, I need a little guy. Little guy. Are you little enough for this?
[5439.69s -> 5451.56s]  Of course not. I need a little guy. Little guy. Link. Hold on. Not yet.
[5452.36s -> 5467.94s]  Try to just reflect. Thank you. This is a bad deal. What's a bad deal? I didn't make any deals.
[5467.94s -> 5471.06s]  Pay debt. I didn't make. What deal did I make? What are you talking about? What's going on?
[5471.06s -> 5497.24s]  Wait. Okay. Hold on. It's bad. This link sucks. Is it? Okay. Hello, Dermot. We are treasurers
[5497.24s -> 5501.96s]  of the great Dermot95 sub debt. Our terms are as follows. Show Otto for minimum one clip
[5501.96s -> 5509.02s]  worth of content is 20 million. Okay. Play TF2 on stream. 350 million. I'm not doing that one.
[5509.02s -> 5514.66s]  Play Doki Doki Literature Club on stream. That's 1.75 billion. You had your chance this afternoon.
[5515.30s -> 5519.70s]  Funny faces and sounds only stream for a minimum of 30 minutes. The debt is erased.
[5520.34s -> 5532.10s]  Wait. What? Funny faces and sounds for 30 minutes means it's all erased. Make Dermot Dump Truck a
[5532.10s -> 5548.42s]  four-part emote like Joop is 1 billion. And then the rest cut off. Okay. Well, let's keep track of
[5548.42s -> 5565.34s]  what we have known right now. I'm at 20 million resolved. Yes. That was for the R2-D2 scream.
[5565.34s -> 5582.73s]  That was part of the deal. There was no deal. Yes, there was. Yes, there was. There was a deal there.
[5582.73s -> 5590.55s]  I want you to go back and watch that. There was a deal. All right. I need to get everybody across
[5590.55s -> 5617.29s]  the bridge. Where's the little guy? Where the fuck is Anakin? He bailed. What? I mean, he bailed.
[5617.93s -> 5641.40s]  Oh, they're all down here. All right. Let's go. Anakin. You. Who the fuck is this? Oh.
[5643.14s -> 5656.57s]  Can't double jump. Is there a staircase that I'm missing? Stairs. Stairs. Stairs. Just hold on.
[5656.57s -> 5664.54s]  Let me just take a sip of my coffee. Where are these magic stairs you're talking about? Oh.
[5666.30s -> 5677.61s]  Hey, Pronovar rocks. Thanks for the 10 community subs. A lot of subs today. Thanks, guys. Thanks for
[5677.61s -> 5685.72s]  the subs. I'm going to be enjoying a nice sub sandwich later. I don't know. What's your guys
[5686.52s -> 5695.45s]  favorite sandwich? This is multi-level marketing. What did I do? I didn't do any multi-level
[5695.45s -> 5705.85s]  marketing anymore. Taco Bell is not a sub. Surprise Ruby. Another five subs. Thanks.
[5705.85s -> 5722.46s]  Surprise Ruby. What is Jersey Mike's? I don't know. Jersey Mike's turkey sub with mayo. Damn.
[5723.34s -> 5727.45s]  You got my attention. You actually do have my attention. You really do.
[5731.91s -> 5740.34s]  You have it. How do I swap? I guess you could just, dude, kill Anakin and you get to swap.
[5740.34s -> 5764.50s]  No, you don't. Let's go. Can I swap? Oh, that was of noise. That's worth a few bucks.
[5765.30s -> 5787.00s]  All right. Attack. Stones. Stones. Yes, sir. How? Get the stones. Stones. Yes, sir. How?
[5787.00s -> 5800.68s]  Get those stones. What is that from? What is that? Stones. What is that? From this stream?
[5800.68s -> 5812.76s]  That's from the fifth element. Oh, right. Yeah, it is. And it's Gary Oldman. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[5813.00s -> 5838.04s]  I got it. It's my favorite childhood game. Collect. Collect. Anybody else jump high?
[5840.89s -> 5866.95s]  Wait a minute. Crafting. Anakin. It's not a vent? Sure. Okay. Hold on. I need to have somebody stand
[5866.95s -> 5878.76s]  on that and then this is a co-op thing. I'm not making an Among Us joke. No, you're not going to
[5878.76s -> 5887.67s]  get that out of me today. I don't even care. Stand on it. Oh, I'm over it. I'm over that.
[5888.23s -> 5908.04s]  Aren't you? Why is he doing that? Of course. He made it and I didn't. Fuck. When they jumped
[5908.04s -> 5910.92s]  together, I thought they were the same. Like, they blended together. They have the same fucking
[5910.92s -> 5933.24s]  Halloween costume on. Vent. Free money. All of you. Remember, they don't celebrate Halloween in
[5933.24s -> 5937.70s]  space. Now you're going to next see something they don't celebrate Christmas or Thanksgiving
[5938.34s -> 5947.77s]  or like New Year's. There's a version of it. We have to get everybody up here.
[5954.22s -> 5960.30s]  And everybody pulls like the Warcraft. There's like a feast of winter time. The winter's feast.
[5961.64s -> 5970.50s]  It's Christmas. You know what I mean? A feast of winter veil. Yeah. If there's no like
[5971.06s -> 5974.26s]  Christmas or like Hanukkah or whatever in space, then they'll make their own one up.
[5981.13s -> 5986.42s]  What is this? Mayonnaise. Why is there a mayonnaise emote? Who has a mayo emote?
[5986.42s -> 5999.19s]  And why are there not enough people up here? Get up here. Who didn't come up with us? Whatever.
[5999.27s -> 6011.77s]  I have to make the path for them. Ah, fuck. Somebody else will do it.
[6017.64s -> 6030.62s]  I did it. What's an actual good deal? Make the path for everybody.
[6032.76s -> 6038.84s]  Right? I gotta... Neopets for a hundred million. All right. Somebody... I was going to do Neopets
[6038.84s -> 6042.36s]  before we did the insanity. Somebody said that like my credit card information is going to get
[6042.36s -> 6047.24s]  stolen. What does that mean? Somebody said like, don't like... Neopets is like a not even secure
[6047.24s -> 6067.56s]  like HTTPS website. Like what does that mean? Help me. Is that fake? Is this false? A lot of
[6067.56s -> 6083.51s]  money. What happened to me? Oh, it exploded. He's just a Neopet hater. I never played it.
[6084.07s -> 6096.26s]  All right. So can I get everybody up here now? Play Toontown. Oh my God. How do I open that?
[6096.90s -> 6103.67s]  How do we get everybody up here? Is this like a magic thing I have to do?
[6108.33s -> 6120.33s]  Please play Toontown. Please play Toontown. Break the flowers.
[6120.33s -> 6128.74s]  Well, that's a weed, but almost an MMO shit show part two and never did it.
[6129.38s -> 6135.94s]  Yeah, you're right. I did. Yeah, you're right. I did. Oh my God. That's what I had to do.
[6137.38s -> 6154.92s]  All right, Qui-Gon. Let's get up there. Get on it. We've proposed a new offer.
[6159.22s -> 6162.02s]  No, hold on. Let me like, let me just get to the end of this level. I'm almost done with the
[6162.02s -> 6173.99s]  Phantom Menace. Link, hold on. I'm almost done with the Phantom Menace. Wait, you're distracting me.
[6174.71s -> 6186.22s]  Switch sides. Eat a spoon of mayo. Or wait, does that work? Is that for real?
[6187.18s -> 6193.27s]  Is that an actual part of the deal? I tried to double jump and it didn't work.
[6193.27s -> 6197.03s]  I literally, I literally pressed double jump and it didn't do anything.
[6220.02s -> 6220.52s]  Stop.
[6226.09s -> 6228.57s]  Depth perception. I'm jumping in the perfect angle.
[6229.69s -> 6238.55s]  Perfect angle. All right, let's go. Well, everyone was waiting for me.
[6239.43s -> 6244.23s]  Yeah, I took the long way back. Sorry, guys. I know you wanted to pull the next mob,
[6244.23s -> 6248.47s]  but I got lost in the instance. That's another wild joke. I'll take a fucking plus two, please.
[6256.97s -> 6260.17s]  For a good wild joke, that's, I mean, that's at least $50,000 off, right?
[6260.97s -> 6294.30s]  Something like that. Begging. Mutants! Mutants! How do I sprint? Somebody said this is a way to
[6294.30s -> 6307.03s]  sprint, right? Oh, by the way, that Star Wars VR game that's coming out, is that an actual
[6307.03s -> 6313.69s]  lightsaber fight? Somebody finally made that fucking game. I cannot believe out of everything
[6313.69s -> 6320.79s]  we've ever seen in VR. No, they didn't make a VR game. A lightsaber. What would, what would,
[6320.79s -> 6330.30s]  what could you possibly be thinking? It's all space combat. I don't understand. You have the
[6330.30s -> 6337.50s]  perfect opportunity to have a lightsaber one-to-one thing that everybody has wanted for a decade.
[6338.06s -> 6353.26s]  A decade. And you're gonna make a space combat simulator? No. Blade and Sorcery. But Blade and
[6353.26s -> 6362.30s]  Sorcery is just a fun little way, and I'm talking about like a Jedi lightsaber Lucas Film co-sponsored
[6363.72s -> 6375.83s]  video game where you play as a Jedi with the one-to-one lightsaber. We have that already.
[6375.83s -> 6386.25s]  We do not have that already. I mean, we have that already. No, we don't. Star Wars Connect.
[6386.25s -> 6395.75s]  That's not even close to what I'm talking about. Vader Immortal. I don't, I feel like you made
[6395.75s -> 6422.78s]  that up. What is Vader Immortal? Vader Immortal. How do I get up here? It's an Oculus game. Can I
[6422.78s -> 6441.02s]  do anything up here to open this? It's real. Break the chairs. That's good money. Did you even read
[6441.02s -> 6462.52s]  the tutorial? There was no tutorial. Or Scrapple. Is there any more stuff? Table. I just joked.
[6463.32s -> 6471.05s]  I just joked R2-D2 for no reason. Wait, that's a red brick. What's a red brick do? That's gotta be
[6471.05s -> 6499.42s]  worth some money. So what the hell? I need a third table. The gray tracing floors. They actually look
[6499.42s -> 6518.20s]  really good. Oh, wait. I just rearranged the furniture. It didn't do anything. That doesn't
[6518.20s -> 6531.11s]  help me. That link. Hold on. That link, that link, that link, that link. That's a scary link.
[6546.07s -> 6553.53s]  And you have new terms. Let me see them. Hellman's extra heavy mayonnaise.
[6554.65s -> 6566.44s]  Wait, there's an extra heavy mayonnaise? What is extra heavy? Is this, that's not a real product?
[6566.44s -> 6574.57s]  Extra heavy mayonnaise? Hellman's extra heavy. Eat the whole thing on stream for one billion off.
[6574.57s -> 6586.70s]  I'm not, I'm not going to do that. What is extra heavy? That sounds gross. Here's better terms.
[6589.24s -> 6598.58s]  Okay, real deal. Let's see what this one says. Real deal. Dump truck ass emote. TF2 stream.
[6598.58s -> 6618.33s]  Four additional emotes. Get erased when all is fulfilled. Hmm. I don't know. I don't know. Some
[6618.33s -> 6626.20s]  of those, at least one or two of those things, I'm not so sure about. You never stated it had
[6626.20s -> 6633.66s]  to be a four-part ass emote. You guys are gonna get me fucking banned. I'm gonna get dropped from
[6633.66s -> 6660.10s]  Twitch TV. It'll be worth it. Take the risk. Why would I take that risk? Four-part like mega ass
[6660.10s -> 6666.98s]  emote. Might, you know why that, here's why I, it's nothing about me getting banned. Here's why I
[6666.98s -> 6672.50s]  don't think that's a good idea. Because you will, you guys will go to whatever other streamers that
[6672.50s -> 6678.26s]  you watch. Whether it's, you know, this person, that person. You are going to four-part thick
[6678.26s -> 6683.22s]  germa ass emote and fuck up their stream and they're going to be really annoyed that there's
[6683.22s -> 6688.42s]  just an ass, a huge thick ass that keeps showing up and that they can't stop it and they can't turn
[6688.42s -> 6692.86s]  it off. You're gonna start, you're gonna start getting banned. You're gonna start getting like
[6692.86s -> 6696.30s]  timed out in other streamers chats and then they're gonna come back to me and they're gonna be like,
[6696.30s -> 6701.34s]  dude, did you make like a four-part huge like thick booty ass, huge ass emote? And I'm gonna
[6701.34s -> 6720.90s]  have to say yes. I'm gonna have to explain myself to all the people that I annoy. Watch out rollers.
[6725.08s -> 6730.60s]  This really is just multi-boxing. I'm just trying to, I signed up for like refer a friend like 12
[6730.60s -> 6736.84s]  times. So we have like a six million percent increase in experience. You're just gonna start
[6736.84s -> 6744.60s]  seeing randomly gold particle effects. Just fly around each individual one of these people
[6745.50s -> 6767.69s]  at random times. Dear Mr. Dump Truck. That's, hey, that's Dr. Dump Truck to you.
[6768.49s -> 6784.78s]  Hellman's real extra thick male is, I can't read it. You guys are going too fast. I can't,
[6784.78s -> 6795.75s]  I don't know what you're doing. I can't read it. Oh, R2 can't make it. Dr. Dump, Dr. Dump Truck
[6795.75s -> 6804.65s]  could be in the rumble. Yeah, maybe if it was WWE 2k13 or 14 because then I could just have like
[6804.65s -> 6817.05s]  the ass speed, the slider that's all the way to the end and everything else is tiny. I have this
[6817.05s -> 6820.73s]  too. All right, you know what's confusing me as well? They all have the mustache on. So I,
[6820.81s -> 6827.61s]  it's hard to, they're all the same person. I thought, I don't even know who that,
[6828.57s -> 6847.26s]  these are all the same. Who are these people? It's all like different Marios. Ooh, shake it.
[6851.40s -> 6858.22s]  By the way, this, we're almost like done with the Phantom Menace of the complete saga.
[6859.72s -> 6889.78s]  Who the hell is Darth Maul? He didn't show up once. He's up your ass. All right. That's such
[6889.78s -> 6899.54s]  an old drunk fucking fat guy thing to say. Anybody seen, anybody seen my glasses? Yeah.
[6900.34s -> 6906.66s]  Yeah, they're up your ass. They're up your ass. Have you checked up your ass?
[6907.78s -> 6950.30s]  No, I haven't. Up your ass, Andy. Quiet. Mario. Mario. Shake it up and you get the goods inside.
[6950.54s -> 6966.52s]  Okay. Stop crack Mario. How's that crack Mario? Can't hit these bricks. All right.
[6978.39s -> 6983.43s]  We're all about the links the last few days, aren't we? Tons of crack links coming in more
[6983.43s -> 6998.31s]  than usual. There's tons of just crack links. Who can get up there? You guys get up here.
[6998.87s -> 7014.90s]  Who can jump this? Nobody can. There's one guy making all these bad links. One man link spammer.
[7014.90s -> 7023.85s]  Is that what you're saying? Didn't I save these guys? I saved these two. All right. I got to
[7023.85s -> 7047.26s]  save the rest of them. One man spam. Got it. Okay. So now, now what we're going to do chat.
[7048.98s -> 7057.03s]  Okay. So, hey chat, here's what we're going to do. All right. Get on this. I'll get on this one. Okay.
[7057.03s -> 7063.62s]  So chat. Here's what we're going to do. Chat. I've seen this before. You guys don't like being
[7063.62s -> 7081.18s]  just called like a chat, right? What do you like to be called? Germamites? By the way, people get
[7081.18s -> 7086.22s]  annoyed when they find out that that's what I call this community. Well, what's the community? The
[7086.22s -> 7095.06s]  germs? The germas? Like the clowns? No, the germamites. And they go, fuck that. Fuck that.
[7095.06s -> 7100.81s]  Don't tell me how to run my community. First of all, second of all, that's what that's what it is.
[7104.50s -> 7116.44s]  How dare you tell me to run my community? Paul. Everyone right now is fucking searching for like
[7116.44s -> 7120.46s]  the streamer or the YouTuber whose name is Paul. Who's he talking about? Who's he talking about?
[7120.46s -> 7126.20s]  Who is that? Who's Paul? I wonder who that is. Who's he? Who's he? Who's he? Who's he? Who's he?
[7126.20s -> 7147.74s]  Hey, Paul. You're an idiot. This has got to go first. Place it. Place it. Pull it. Pop it.
[7147.74s -> 7175.29s]  Twist it. R2D2 sound. Gotta collect every coin. Every single coin. I will not part with one
[7176.09s -> 7191.21s]  single coin. Not one. Trinket. Oh, little thief. Oh, you're so magnificent. The stories they tell
[7191.21s -> 7196.33s]  us surely are immountable and insurmountable to you, most smog the powerful.
[7197.13s -> 7208.34s]  Is that what they say? Thief. I almost want you to take it. If I can see it, eat him aside.
[7209.14s -> 7215.54s]  To watch his very bright brain. I haven't seen the movie in a very long time. I tried.
[7216.34s -> 7234.23s]  The take they leave in. Come on, break it. What is this? How can I not open this?
[7234.23s -> 7245.62s]  I just walked off the edge. Alright, let's go. Come on. Go. Where's Darth Maul? Why didn't I
[7245.62s -> 7253.90s]  play Lego Lord of the Rings? Wait. Wait, where's this last person? Where's this last hostage?
[7256.66s -> 7266.20s]  What's cool in Lord of the Rings? This is plus a full letter grade. Yeah, this is plus a full
[7266.20s -> 7283.02s]  letter grade. What are you doing then? Be free. Is somebody just holding a gun? I thought I was
[7283.02s -> 7287.66s]  going to die. Is somebody just holding a gun to one of the hostages somewhere? This is watching
[7287.66s -> 7311.98s]  this. It's like, where is he? Where is he? Oh, down? No, he's up above the entrance. Wait,
[7311.98s -> 7320.89s]  I get this person to jump over here? Wait, wait, wait, wait. He's all the way back. I need to sprint.
[7321.69s -> 7328.22s]  How much for ASCAM? Zero. But no, seriously, what's better Lord of the Rings or Star Wars?
[7328.22s -> 7344.98s]  That's a tough one. Lord of the Rings or Star Wars? What's better? Well, Lord of the Rings is
[7344.98s -> 7354.57s]  probably... This is actually kind of hard. Oh, there he is. All right, somebody shoot that. Shoot
[7354.57s -> 7373.21s]  him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot. A saw. Yeah, a saw is better. I need to get
[7373.21s -> 7391.21s]  up there. Come here. Get up there and shoot. Okay, so if I really had to do it, if I really had to
[7391.21s -> 7402.76s]  make the decision, I would probably say... Okay, I like the Lord of the Rings world more, but I like
[7402.76s -> 7418.58s]  the Star Wars objects more. That makes sense for some of you, right? I like the weapons in Star Wars
[7418.58s -> 7428.71s]  and the stuff and the ships and the lightsabers and the... I like that more than the swords and
[7428.71s -> 7434.07s]  the shields. Oh, wait. Wait. Okay, Game of Thrones... All right, hold on. Game of Thrones before
[7434.07s -> 7439.32s]  season seven versus Star Wars. I don't know. I like that the swords have names and stuff.
[7443.70s -> 7457.29s]  Finish the level. All right, hold on. What is the Lord of the Rings? Yeah, they do. What? Yeah,
[7457.29s -> 7466.09s]  that's true, but... A goblin cleaver? Yeah, I don't know. Shit, this is... I don't know. I might be
[7466.81s -> 7471.43s]  up in front of my own bullshit here because the lightsabers don't have names.
[7472.23s -> 7482.31s]  It's just green lightsaber. It's not like the sword of the morning. It's just yellow lightsaber.
[7488.66s -> 7494.22s]  Some do. Yeah, like two. Yeah, like the darksaber, right? Okay, there's one. What, there's two others?
[7497.96s -> 7502.76s]  Sorry. Out of like the 4,000 lightsabers that have been crafted from the fucking
[7502.76s -> 7516.90s]  Adamantite crystals, there's two that have names. Leia's Gonkdroid. I don't know how to do that.
[7516.90s -> 7529.88s]  The crystals have names. Oh, they don't. Yeah, it's called like the... What are they called?
[7530.84s -> 7541.16s]  Cyber crystals? The hyper crystals? Kyber crystals? Yeah. I don't want to do that. All right,
[7541.16s -> 7547.32s]  here we go. Here comes the boss fight. The final boss of episode one. I had to do that. I'm sorry.
[7549.10s -> 7551.98s]  Fake fan. Chaos emeralds. Yeah, it doesn't matter. They're all the same thing.
[7552.78s -> 7560.84s]  Don't be surprised, by the way, if in like three to five years, the chaos emeralds are turned into
[7560.84s -> 7575.46s]  beam swords. Why the fuck not? It is a Sonic game. That would be actually pretty cool. Why have they
[7575.46s -> 7583.85s]  not done that? Imagine a Sonic the Hedgehog game with lightsabers? It's Darth Vader. No,
[7583.85s -> 7617.72s]  oh, he has the mustache on. It's Darth Maul. Here it comes. Look at the skull. I want to be able to
[7617.72s -> 7636.23s]  see their faces. Obi-Wan, no. That wasn't supposed to happen to you. That's supposed to happen to me.
[7648.95s -> 7661.90s]  Oh shit. Oh, no. No, Obi-Wan. Well, I want to do that. Can I catch them in the air?
[7665.74s -> 7687.18s]  Aha. I can do that too. Traitor. Fuck. Darth Maul's a traitor, right? Traitor. I like this guy.
[7687.18s -> 7706.63s]  Spin, spin, he's spinning. He's doing this wrong. What do I do about this? He just blocks it. Oh,
[7706.63s -> 7718.74s]  he's three. He's no hearts left. That's Count Dooku. Count Dooku, join me. Join me, Link,
[7718.74s -> 7728.84s]  and together we can destroy the Sith. I'll never join you. That's unfortunate. Now you will have
[7728.84s -> 7749.93s]  to die. Fan fiction. I said Link. Yeah, I did say Link. And dude, in my fan fiction, Link talks?
[7749.93s -> 7765.86s]  Are you fucking kidding me? Do you guys think they'll ever give Link dialogue ever again?
[7765.86s -> 7783.74s]  I don't think so. Give me that canister. Maybe, why not? Maybe. It's probably gonna,
[7783.74s -> 7791.74s]  but it's gonna have to be a celebrity. Let's be real. It's gonna end up being Tom Holland,
[7791.74s -> 7817.91s]  and you all know it. Right, get in the car. All right, other side. Elijah Wood. Yeah, I could see
[7817.91s -> 7827.74s]  that. I would, you know what? I wouldn't even be bad. I wouldn't even, I would be okay with that.
[7828.46s -> 7839.78s]  That's doesn't even, that would be all right, I think. I think that'd be fine. He's 40.
[7843.21s -> 7848.65s]  But are we trying to say that, are we questioning the talent of Elijah Wood?
[7848.65s -> 7854.81s]  You're actually doing that right now. Are you sure you're doing that? We are right now questioning
[7854.81s -> 7861.38s]  the talent of any age Elijah Wood. I need a stormtrooper to get up here. All right, well,
[7861.38s -> 7866.68s]  let's just walk over here. Yes, that's unbelievable to me. All right, get him.
[7878.63s -> 7900.20s]  I was trying to like murder him. You're an Elijah Wood simp. Oh, please. He's like a wicked nice guy,
[7900.20s -> 7905.16s]  and he's really talented. Oh no, I can't believe you're sipping for that guy. He's like a good
[7905.16s -> 7929.14s]  person. Oh shit, this is bad. Face us. Wait, no, no, no. I want to change character. I don't
[7929.14s -> 7940.58s]  want to be the one that gets, uh, the one that goes shopping later. Why does the double jump
[7940.58s -> 7949.22s]  doesn't work? Okay, I, double jump doesn't work sometimes. Why would I work right there and not
[7949.22s -> 7957.35s]  work here? Click, click. All right, let's go everyone. I mean, Qui-Gon. No, stop running away.
[7961.94s -> 7968.02s]  That was, wow. Does you guys like this game that much? That was very clearly a let's have a final
[7968.02s -> 7981.05s]  boss fight here, and they took him away and ran him away. That one song I'm going to hear in my
[7981.05s -> 8006.36s]  sleep. That din-din-did-a-din. Fuck. Qui-Gon, help me. Qui-Gon. Holy shit, we just got like
[8006.36s -> 8027.10s]  the AI director. It was like pissed we were taking too long. Hold them off. Spike. Wait, Qui-Gon fell
[8027.10s -> 8049.90s]  off. Click the link. Just wait. Hold on. All right. Your toast, Darth Vader. Maul. Oh wait,
[8049.90s -> 8062.01s]  this is the part where it goes. What are they actually saying? I've heard that song a thousand
[8062.01s -> 8078.58s]  times. What are the lyrics to that song? It's gibberish. Wait, is it, it's actually just
[8078.58s -> 8091.13s]  gibberish? They just go, la la la. They're not saying anything? No, that's not real.
[8104.26s -> 8113.34s]  No, it's Latin. Wait, blue. What are they, what are they saying? Where's the other one?
[8120.06s -> 8130.66s]  That's it? Wait, is this thing where it's like Lord of the Rings where they made up a whole
[8130.66s -> 8138.52s]  language? Wait, can we fight him? No, wait. Isn't, wait, doesn't, there's not how this
[8138.52s -> 8153.11s]  work happens in the movie. Yes, it is. Wait, no, how come we're both here? Let's change the,
[8153.11s -> 8166.76s]  let's change history then. All right, but if you're playing with your little brother and he's playing
[8166.76s -> 8171.96s]  Qui-Gon because you don't want to play Qui-Gon for, you know, obvious reasons incoming, then what
[8171.96s -> 8187.69s]  happens when the little brother be really sad? By the way, I feel bad for people that have never
[8187.69s -> 8191.45s]  seen Star Wars and they're like just waiting for some reason and you're going to see like the Lego
[8191.45s -> 8197.64s]  version of like a major plot point of a movie. Okay, if you've held up with us long enough watching
[8197.64s -> 8212.36s]  Star Wars, you never were going to watch it, so who cares? Here we go. This is it. This is it.
[8224.57s -> 8246.76s]  Good block. How do you swing? How do you swing? Click, mouse, enter, space bar, A, Z, control,
[8246.76s -> 8262.82s]  shift. How do I swing with, how do I swing with Qui-Gon? H, J, K, L, semi, M, period, colon, slash,
[8263.99s -> 8281.19s]  numpad, numpad. Okay, this is hard to do this. Fuck each other.
[8285.00s -> 8296.79s]  Just like in the movie. We're getting into an argument. Now Obi-Wan, you, leave me alone.
[8299.19s -> 8304.98s]  Oh shit. Spoilers. Yeah, you didn't remember this part.
[8319.02s -> 8324.82s]  Eventually we'll get it. Yeah, you guys don't remember the part where like Qui-Gon turns on
[8324.82s -> 8340.07s]  Obi-Wan right here and he joins the Sith and then they have to battle it out and then dude Darth
[8340.07s -> 8345.91s]  Maul breaks his double-sided lightsaber in half and hands the other side to Qui-Gon and they fucking
[8345.91s -> 8363.53s]  both fight with a single saber at it. Ow. I don't know how to do um force pull with uh the other.
[8363.53s -> 8383.58s]  Oh there we go. Thanks for saving me. He's putting his lightsaber away. Hold on a minute. I just,
[8383.58s -> 8418.52s]  I lost something over here. Get him in the back. Oh no. Nooooo. Am I right? Wait, that doesn't
[8418.52s -> 8450.71s]  happen. Ow. Ow. Ow. That fucking hurts. That's so, ah I didn't expect it to be like that.
[8451.83s -> 8458.97s]  His eyes go X and he just smashes his head on the star. I'm not a monster. It was unexpected and
[8458.97s -> 8468.47s]  quick. It's so abrupt. That doesn't even happen in the movie. Why are you laughing? I'm not
[8468.47s -> 8472.47s]  laughing at that. I'm laughing at, I'm laughing at the fact that it happened not the fact that it was,
[8472.47s -> 8475.83s]  I look at laughing at that way that it happened not the fact that it was sad that it happened.
[8477.03s -> 8507.94s]  This is where we all get the medals right? Oh here it goes. Did that was, it was very enjoyable.
[8507.94s -> 8517.96s]  That was, hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Um that was
[8518.78s -> 8536.44s]  like two hours long. Did this game come out on its own? No. One, two, three did. Okay. Because
[8536.44s -> 8540.92s]  I was gonna say if this like was a standalone just video game like the Phantom Menace that you bought
[8540.92s -> 8550.04s]  at Walmart. I'm not sure you got your $60 worth but it's three games. Okay. You guys know how
[8550.04s -> 8570.06s]  the credits look. Who cares? 6.3%. Okay so that was the Phantom Menace. Oh shit. How do I delete
[8570.06s -> 8581.16s]  the second player? Drop out. There we go. It was like 30 bucks. Well that's good. We need a link.
[8581.16s -> 8594.02s]  All right hold on. I'm gonna do a link and I'm gonna go take this. All right what is, what do you
[8594.02s -> 8605.00s]  got? That's, I'm not gonna click that. I will, I clicked it but I'm not gonna show that and that's
[8605.00s -> 8610.44s]  um something I am not, I will, there will be no comment. I'm gonna have an emotionless comment
[8611.40s -> 8618.33s]  on um on that image that I was just linked. Okay so anything else you'd like me to see before I
[8620.28s -> 8631.64s]  like get out of here? Go to the bathroom. Okay good. I'm the like the fat face penis shirt thing.
[8631.64s -> 8645.34s]  I've already linked it last night. Uh this is a, this is a, I, I, why do you have this picture?
[8657.64s -> 8663.83s]  That's the pants. That's the way the pants are. That's like the pants.
[8664.63s -> 8677.42s]  Like okay do you think I have like a hamburger dick? Please. That's the pants the way the zipper
[8677.42s -> 8683.74s]  is pushed again. Larry David did an entire episode of his critically acclaimed hilarious
[8683.74s -> 8691.80s]  television show Curb Your Enthusiasm about this exact thing. I don't even need to describe this.
[8691.80s -> 8855.66s]  This is a Larry David routine so just go watch Curb Your Enthusiasm. I'll be right back. Does
[8855.66s -> 8860.94s]  Jerma hate Adam Sandler? No. I actually think Uncut Gems is a really really good movie and I
[8860.94s -> 8867.34s]  thought he was very good in it. I think uh Adam Sandler uh gets a lot of hate. Doesn't get a lot
[8867.34s -> 8873.19s]  of credit for some of the things that he's done. From the Saturday Night Live years through like
[8873.19s -> 8877.75s]  the mid to late 90s he made some really really actually really funny talented interesting things
[8877.75s -> 8884.58s]  and he got a little complacent made three or four real stinkers in a row and then he uh got into
[8884.58s -> 8890.23s]  some serious acting and I think he's I think he's pretty good. I think he gets too much hate for no
[8890.23s -> 8901.48s]  reason. Well hold on a minute. Yeah he deserves quite a bit of criticism for like the five movies
[8901.48s -> 8914.26s]  in a row that were like like 10 on Rotten Tomatoes right. It was a string of about six straight years
[8914.26s -> 8923.46s]  seven straight years where almost everything he did was awful just awful awful awful. We talk
[8923.46s -> 8929.22s]  about like the before times and then the after times of like the mid-2000s Adam Sandler disaster
[8929.22s -> 8947.30s]  career. Donkachino. Donka donka donka donka donkachino. Don't give me that. Don't give me
[8947.70s -> 8954.23s]  I saw it. People initially were very we were very mad that I just did that. Let's do this. Let's
[8954.23s -> 8963.83s]  get back to this. We're gonna do episode two which is um back in the clones. Oh wait I have money to
[8963.83s -> 9001.06s]  spend. Wait this bot right he's so slow I can't he is gonk an oven. What kind of droid is he?
[9001.06s -> 9014.74s]  He's a trash can. Oh okay I knew he was something. When am I gonna get like some of the heavy hitters
[9014.74s -> 9021.48s]  like Palpatine and oh wait this is the prequel saga right. Okay uh I mean I want to buy some stuff.
[9022.04s -> 9031.99s]  All right Phantom Menace. Wait I can do whatever one I want. I don't have to go in order. Oh I got
[9031.99s -> 9034.63s]  to do I'm gonna do my favorite Star Wars movie then. I don't have to I didn't I thought I had
[9034.63s -> 9038.47s]  to go in order like one two three four five. Did I watch the movies? All right fuck the whole prequel
[9038.47s -> 9055.34s]  drill. This stuff sucks. I want to wait but I want to do which one episode. Okay Empire Strikes Back.
[9056.06s -> 9065.99s]  Empire Strikes Back. By the way I'm also not going to be one of those like haters that says that.
[9065.99s -> 9070.55s]  I actually enjoyed the prequel series for what it was. Sure there was a lot of problems with it
[9071.11s -> 9078.07s]  but I mean it was I thought it was okay. I thought it was look it they added some things.
[9081.03s -> 9088.33s]  Roy Decker. Why did I just buy that for? Extra toggle. What's that? Why am I buying these? What's
[9088.33s -> 9114.49s]  an extra toggle? Where's where's Roy Decker? I just bought it. Not Roy Decker. Where's Roy Decker?
[9115.93s -> 9118.97s]  Start a bar fight. I did that in the very beginning and I caused a lot of problems.
[9119.69s -> 9123.29s]  All right let me do Empire Strikes Back. It's my favorite movie. This and Return of the Jedi are my
[9123.29s -> 9136.39s]  favorites. Empire Strikes Back. I don't want to be Qui-Gon anymore. Make a custom character. How? Use
[9136.39s -> 9142.98s]  the character creator. Wait how? Where? How do I do that? Go back go back go back. Where? In here?

[9181.40s -> 9201.72s]  Indiana Jones or Indiana Jones the game? Lego. I don't care about Indiana Jones at all. I really.
[9201.72s -> 9207.16s]  Indiana Jones is now available to buy in the shop. You really gonna do that? I really I have to be
[9207.16s -> 9211.00s]  honest. I really don't care. Indiana Jones is like at the bottom of my interesting
[9211.64s -> 9217.62s]  American cinematic trilogies. It I just don't I don't hate it but I'm just not into it.
[9219.43s -> 9233.16s]  Bathroom? All right give me out of here. Temple of Doom was awesome. Temple of Doom was crazy.
[9234.30s -> 9245.35s]  But I'm not I'm not a big fan of the other ones really. It's the worst one.
[9246.31s -> 9256.02s]  Is it? I think it's the only one I've watched. I just remember being like a little kid.
[9256.74s -> 9263.48s]  How do I get out of here? All right I was like I was like 12 and I remember there was like a guy
[9263.48s -> 9267.56s]  that like pulled people's hearts out and they like ate like animals brains and stuff and I
[9267.56s -> 9285.18s]  remember being it was like I was scared. Over here two player arcade mode. Right right right right
[9285.18s -> 9310.15s]  right right. Question mark. Oh look at this. I I need okay who do I want to be? Oh definitely
[9310.15s -> 9327.38s]  a slug guy. C3PO. This now you talk about fan fiction. That's okay yeah yeah yeah definitely.
[9328.42s -> 9339.50s]  I definitely want an R2D2 Jedi. If I had my lightsaber by the way it would be um white.
[9339.50s -> 9353.35s]  It would be just white or um yeah be white. Just R2D2 with a gun. Silver yeah whatever it is.
[9353.99s -> 9373.53s]  Well it has to match him. Blue. This is just like this sucks.
[9376.94s -> 9402.47s]  He's standing on two feet. Where's his droid body? Did I pass it? Okay as a stranger one. No hat.
[9402.47s -> 9443.34s]  How do I take the hair off? What's going on? Gonk gonk gonk gonk gonk gonk. What what is it?
[9443.34s -> 9459.11s]  Okay so how do I use them? Ow. Auto D2. All right this is a good link. You're right.
[9459.67s -> 9475.85s]  You have to do it in free play. Oh auto D2. That's the that's who is inside of the case.
[9475.85s -> 9483.93s]  That's very cute. All right so I can't use them in the story. Fine. All right let's I want to do
[9483.93s -> 9491.64s]  episode five. Let's go. Empire Strikes Back. I don't know if everyone's gonna call me like a
[9491.64s -> 9496.52s]  Reddit normie for saying that this is like one of my favorite movies in the franchise. Sure go for
[9496.52s -> 9527.21s]  it. Turn of the Jedi is probably my actual favorite one. This is dark. You guys know the story. For a
[9527.21s -> 9531.21s]  second I forgot what game I was playing. I just knew it was Star Wars and I saw how weird polygon
[9531.21s -> 9543.51s]  looking that ship was and I thought something was wrong with the computer. Here's the force Luke.
[9543.51s -> 9549.82s]  I'm also one of those weirdos that didn't hate The Force Awakens. I wouldn't say it was my
[9549.82s -> 9570.73s]  favorite but I didn't hate it. Why don't I get to do that part? I don't get to do that part.
[9570.73s -> 9591.34s]  That part's awesome. They're all good. Uh these Darth Vader simlish. It's uh I love it.
[9599.77s -> 9603.53s]  Uh no I think I mean here's the thing about Star Wars. It's such a beloved franchise and
[9603.53s -> 9608.33s]  everybody loves it. Everybody is like oh it's the best thing ever but let's be really honest.
[9608.89s -> 9619.02s]  Like probably half of these movies are not very good. The other half though
[9619.58s -> 9628.33s]  they're fantastic. Like fan-fucking-tastic. Oh shit that's B to use your toe cable.
[9631.19s -> 9639.67s]  This one is this one's awesome so far. Okay well you can do it on the um the 8080s right?
[9645.72s -> 9664.94s]  Ow out of bounds. Luke, Luke stop doing tricks and focus on the enemies. This is where Luke
[9664.94s -> 9668.22s]  gets way too overconfident and he just lets his force powers do he because he can just do
[9668.22s -> 9691.19s]  anything he wants. He's like cheating in the lobby at this point. VAC. All right how do I get rid of
[9691.19s -> 9703.75s]  this? I need I need a tie fighter to open this. Oh Luke why are you doing Peter Griffin? Peter
[9703.75s -> 9712.18s]  Griffin? What are you talking about? I did? When did I do my Peter Griffin? I have to do that to
[9712.18s -> 9741.58s]  10 of these. Oh so long King Bowser. Wait we're fighting over the bomb. Who's gonna get it? What
[9741.58s -> 9764.41s]  do I do with that? I gotta throw it in there. All right throw the bomb. What? Wrong way. Wrong place.
[9768.78s -> 9778.36s]  There it is. Throw it in. This is literally a kid's game. Yeah I know you I've never played it
[9778.36s -> 9781.80s]  though. You played this game like a thousand times when you were a little kid. I didn't play it.
[9788.79s -> 9806.73s]  Dropped him. I was 20 when this came out. When did this come out? This is pretty old doesn't it?
[9807.29s -> 9822.55s]  Are you how are you as old as me? How old are you? When did this come out? When did this actually come
[9822.55s -> 9836.38s]  out? When did I do it? 2007. Now that's not that long ago. 2009. That's not that long ago at all.
[9837.10s -> 9854.92s]  Oh never mind. I don't know why I thought this game came out in like like 2000. Grab the bomb.
[9867.32s -> 9895.99s]  Uh what? I don't understand. This is just like Tony Hawk. Ow. All right wrap him up. Let's go.
[9896.63s -> 9913.85s]  Prove to everybody why you're my favorite movie. Boom. Bomb. It's lice. Blow it up. Blow him up.
[9914.57s -> 9926.39s]  No get out of the fucking way. There it is. All right that's another one dead. How many more of
[9926.39s -> 9945.64s]  these do I have to kill? Somebody said this sucks. It doesn't suck. All right roll it in.
[9955.34s -> 9977.13s]  This is vomiting. Hold on. This whips. Don't make me laugh. Actually now that you said that why did
[9977.13s -> 9982.10s]  you say that? Now am I gonna get sick? Don't say that out loud. I actually now I'm gonna puke
[9982.10s -> 10013.82s]  because you said that. I was fine until you said that. Okay yeah. Get up there. Shit why did you say
[10013.82s -> 10051.64s]  that? I think we're good. What? Go up the ramp whopper cock. Okay destroy all the little droids.
[10059.72s -> 10080.94s]  One more. Kill it. Kill it. All right now what? Now I gotta blow something up. Please stop moving
[10080.94s -> 10085.82s]  for a second. I'm gonna vomit. What should I have for food today? I know that's a weird transition
[10085.82s -> 10109.56s]  but what should I eat today? A whopper? No Burger King sucks. Burger King just it's not it used to
[10109.56s -> 10115.53s]  be good. It really did. You know maybe like 10 years ago I would have agreed with you and said
[10115.53s -> 10120.68s]  yeah I'm gonna go get a whopper. Or like a like a stacker. Like a BK stacker. That was my favorite.
[10121.66s -> 10128.07s]  BK stacker with the stacker sauce. Then everything you ordered from Burger King as of five years ago
[10128.07s -> 10132.47s]  was cold. What happened? Did they just like get rid of the microwaves? Did they get rid of their heaters?
[10133.43s -> 10143.45s]  I have not had hot food from Burger King in five years. That's an accurate actual statement. I have
[10143.45s -> 10150.39s]  not. I haven't been there granted for very many times but the times that I have been there it has
[10150.39s -> 10161.67s]  never been even warm. I don't know why that is. Now that happens at McDonald's not frequently but
[10161.67s -> 10173.78s]  it does but not to the extent that I've saw it at Burger King. Fine hot. Um well okay let me think
[10173.78s -> 10185.18s]  about this. Okay if you put your hand like on your ass right now. The heat like coming off your
[10185.18s -> 10191.51s]  ass right now. I would do I would consider that like like I would consider like McDonald's like
[10192.15s -> 10197.38s]  warm. Like that's like fast food warm to me. Like like put your hand on like your belly like on
[10197.38s -> 10200.98s]  your stomach. Just hold it there for a second. That's like okay like when you feel the burger
[10200.98s -> 10227.42s]  in the wrapper that that's edible. That's edible. Like kind of hot. Do I kill these things? What the
[10227.42s -> 10239.46s]  fuck are you talking about? Like luke warm. Just like slightly warmer than room temperature is how
[10239.46s -> 10251.64s]  a lot of fast food comes. You just made thousands of people you just made thousands of people touch
[10251.64s -> 10261.58s]  their ass. Well no I just mean like your body heat. Body heat is like a respectable fast food
[10261.58s -> 10280.12s]  heat. I'm okay with that. I'm not touching that. My ass is not wrapped up in a hamburger.
[10280.84s -> 10286.68s]  You supplast a fun thing. Like my ass is not your ass is no you're not gonna eat your ass in a wrapper.
[10310.71s -> 10316.76s]  Before he gets up come on. This man can't beat a children's game. Do you see how much chaos
[10316.76s -> 10335.69s]  is happening on the screen right now? Even more of these. All right let's get the big guy first.
[10336.41s -> 10355.88s]  All right wait clear it out. Big guy first go. Fucking read the screen. I'm getting rid of the
[10355.88s -> 10369.69s]  big guy first. I know I can see the icons. What are you talking about? Shit this this is no longer
[10369.69s -> 10388.31s]  my favorite movie. This is not my favorite movie anymore. Oh give me a break come on. Okay I got it.
[10388.31s -> 10410.49s]  You can't die in this game. Who cares? Star Wars diaper check? It's not full. But um what?
[10411.13s -> 10438.60s]  What's wrong with me today? What am I doing? Why am I saying these things? No. You're a piss baby.
[10439.32s -> 10447.86s]  Okay I thought that was a lightsaber and I was gonna say that's a very strange lightsaber.
[10448.98s -> 10495.30s]  Hey you little piss baby. All right get it. Two percent. 10 out of 160. This is a cool game.
[10496.55s -> 10503.51s]  Now I understand why this won the 2.5 billion dollar erasure screen. I get it now. This is why
[10503.51s -> 10520.54s]  you wanted me to play this so bad. Empire Strikes Back. Escape from Echo Base. Oh shit we're on the
[10520.54s -> 10535.70s]  ground now. Links are now accepted. Well not yet. Let me get to uh an episode after this.
[10541.74s -> 10546.62s]  By the way what's up? Like they're like brother and sister right? And like while we're like in love.
[10546.62s -> 10563.80s]  It's fucking weird. Oh it's Han Solo. Oh this is not Luke. I thought it was Han Solo.
[10568.57s -> 10576.02s]  Favorite movie. Yeah but I like I don't know whatever. It looks like Luke. It could look. It
[10576.02s -> 10581.22s]  could be. I was in the movie. I haven't seen it. I've not seen this movie in probably 10 to 15
[10581.22s -> 10598.25s]  years at least. Who can open this? I don't know what to do. We played Battleship. I'm thinking of
[10598.25s -> 10611.32s]  Battleship. What a fucking pog game that is. Nobody plays it anymore. Have you guys noticed that
[10611.32s -> 10615.72s]  Battleship is not cool anymore? Nobody plays it when it's like one of the most interesting games.
[10615.72s -> 10619.64s]  You know what I really really really hope to god happens and I'll be the one to start it if I have
[10619.64s -> 10625.06s]  to. You know like chess took over Twitch. You're like Among Us took over Twitch. When is Battleship
[10625.06s -> 10639.22s]  going to take over Twitch and be a huge thing? I'll do it and actually I'm very happy that chess
[10639.78s -> 10647.18s]  got very popular because that's a game. That's a game for brains and it's really interesting.
[10664.10s -> 10674.12s]  Where do I go? I can't pick up the I cannot pick up like the sesame street play telephone
[10674.76s -> 10687.58s]  machine thing. How do what do I do? Build. Build Legos. What? Well I don't know I could take. What?
[10687.58s -> 10715.27s]  I thought it was just whatever. So let's go. Build. Build. Build. What do we go from here?
[10715.27s -> 10727.16s]  Oh one two three. It's a metal melter. How come there's been no Star Wars RTS game with like Jedi
[10727.16s -> 10745.10s]  and stuff? Has there been? There was but what happened to it? It's been multiple. It exists.
[10747.18s -> 10758.26s]  Yes. Did it age well? It's still good shit. Is it really? People still play it.
[10761.93s -> 10780.52s]  Yeah maybe I'll play it. Is it run on new hardware? It's on Steam. Is it really?
[10781.08s -> 10815.94s]  I'm gonna have to check this out. Oh I missed a blue. Off screen. Can't even get me. Rebuild it.

[10830.97s -> 10847.26s]  Left side. I think we just move. Rebuild. Barrier. Barrier activated. Barrier online.
[10847.82s -> 10869.21s]  Why did you say that? Barrier? That was an Overwatch joke? Well it wasn't an Overwatch
[10869.21s -> 10875.29s]  joke. It was just I said a thing from Overwatch. If it was an Overwatch joke don't you think I
[10875.29s -> 10878.25s]  would have been like hey remember what Overwatch would look like? McCree goes like a shadow.
[10878.97s -> 10894.54s]  I just said they were lying. Didn't do anything. What does this do? Oh sick. I thought that was
[10894.54s -> 10927.13s]  Worf from Star Trek. Oh C-3PO. Finally. We're dead. Skeletons in a kid's game?
[10929.34s -> 10933.27s]  Heck. All right we need another person. Where's another person? Where's the next person?
[10933.99s -> 10957.18s]  We're missing somebody. Wait can C-3PO open this? C-3PO come here. Okay that's the button. What
[10957.18s -> 10988.87s]  happened to him? Oh shit. You can't control that? Move. All right get that door open. Wait okay I
[10988.87s -> 11003.29s]  was gonna say he doesn't have any hands. Can he open it? This is kind of this is sad. Can we get
[11003.29s -> 11037.30s]  him his his body parts back? Oh it's an ambush. You did this but I will deny that I did. All right
[11037.30s -> 11063.27s]  rebuild. I'm gonna get on that gun. We do oh I need a Jedi for this in free play and his suffering.
[11063.27s -> 11099.27s]  No. Oh wait coins. Move. Coins. They did a good job with this game. That's good. I like it. Yeah
[11099.27s -> 11107.26s]  they are they're those little buttons. Doesn't this make you just want to buy a big Lego set?
[11107.82s -> 11112.86s]  Dump it out on the counter. Look at it for a few minutes and look at the instructions
[11112.86s -> 11116.06s]  and then put it all back in the container and put it in the closet and never open it again.
[11116.78s -> 11137.85s]  What happened? Oh I gotta break that. Wait give me this. This makes me want to play Luigi's Mansion
[11137.85s -> 11153.59s]  3. Did you guys watch that? All right one in the chat if you would actually watch me play
[11153.59s -> 11169.94s]  Luigi's Mansion 3 and I think that would be like a POG champ stream. All right let's go play the
[11169.94s -> 11192.71s]  first one instead. Yeah it's not very POG. Really? Damn adaptive difficulty. What's going on here?
[11193.35s -> 11209.05s]  Let's get out of here. Get together. I love the first one so much. All right for Nintendo
[11209.05s -> 11220.39s]  Switch week that's something that I should do. How do I get him up? Uh how do I get C-3PO out
[11220.39s -> 11240.14s]  up there? Is he like his own little car? Wait he has his own little car. Wait C-3PO come here.
[11249.66s -> 11286.58s]  No wait. Where'd he go? Is he gonna be up? Oh play Mario. Yeah this is gonna be a Mario week.
[11286.58s -> 11293.22s]  I'm gonna play Mario Super Mario Super Mario. I'm gonna play Mario Galaxy 2. I've never played
[11293.22s -> 11301.06s]  that before. I'm gonna Mario Odyssey. I gotta play Mario Odyssey as well. That's another one that
[11301.06s -> 11306.82s]  you'll see probably pretty soon here. We'll go through all the good Switch catalog games that
[11306.82s -> 11318.71s]  I never really got to. Hold on that's a lot of blues over there. I played Mario Maker. I played
[11318.71s -> 11327.80s]  Mario Maker one and two. Oh what? I also want to do Mario 64 slide levels. Heard that exists as
[11327.80s -> 11346.28s]  well. Do I have to jump on these? All right I got one. I have the same anger in Mario RPG when you
[11346.28s -> 11362.26s]  try to get the frog coins in the river. What about Zelda? I don't know about Zelda. I never was a
[11362.26s -> 11390.26s]  big fan of Zelda. I liked Ocarina of Time. That's kind of it. He's a dive? I'm just losing them as
[11390.26s -> 11417.72s]  I get them. Yeah I'm trying to touch the buttons. It's a lot harder than it looks. It's not very
[11417.72s -> 11433.37s]  much handling power here. It's children's game. It doesn't mean it's not designed to do more.
[11433.37s -> 11486.92s]  Hey. Who said sit down? Shit. RTX on. This company. Yes. You got it. Step on it please.
[11487.56s -> 11495.05s]  Developers developers developers developers developers developers developers developers
[11495.45s -> 11525.48s]  developers. I miss like the meme ability of Steve Ballmer. Oh it's Chewbacca. Chewy. Chewy. Is it
[11525.48s -> 11544.41s]  weird that the Han Solo's Chewy has the same energy as Walter White's Jessie? They both sidekicks.
[11544.41s -> 11558.78s]  Yeah that's I guess that's true. I'm gonna step on the other one. Chewy we have to cook. Yeah over
[11558.78s -> 11570.23s]  here. No no no don't block it off. Don't ruin it. Good. Now I see why uh co-op with this game makes
[11570.23s -> 11574.79s]  a lot of sense considering that yeah there's a lot of things that would go faster with two people.
[11575.43s -> 11602.01s]  Wait what? Points. Don't block it in the I did it. I ruined it. No I didn't. Do we get mounts?
[11602.65s -> 11623.86s]  This is a switch? All characters except droids can ride creatures. This is awesome. Do they have an
[11623.86s -> 11639.29s]  attack? Yeah but you can jump super high off of them. It's a one percent drop. Dude I got it. It
[11639.29s -> 11654.25s]  only took me seven thousand attempts. Wait turn it off. How do we turn this shit off?
[11654.25s -> 11667.69s]  I'm weird that I have to do here. Oh it's destroyed. He didn't move. You're on fault.
[11668.33s -> 11681.18s]  All right get on the mount. Can't fight on the mount. Wait Chewbacca can rip their limbs off?
[11684.66s -> 11704.26s]  A little morbid don't you think? Did he do that in the movie? All right somebody came down.
[11704.26s -> 11736.81s]  It's referenced in episode four. Oh that's a neat little easter egg. Can we get in this?
[11737.53s -> 11754.39s]  This is the Millennium Falcon. How do I activate it? Stop protect me. Shit's ready to go.
[11762.31s -> 11766.31s]  Oh there he is. This is where Obi-Wan and him no that's the other one.
[11774.62s -> 11797.21s]  They're thinking that's Luke. They're just like why do they oh level complete. Yes you unlocked
[11797.29s -> 11814.62s]  Han Solo. Princess Leia. C-3PO. Chewbacca. Are you a true Jedi? No. Is Kit Fisto in the game?
[11815.34s -> 11831.62s]  Is he actually unlockable? I'm not that I care that much but I do. Play episode three.
[11832.18s -> 11837.38s]  Episode three. Episode three. Episode three. Go to episode two and three.
[11839.77s -> 11856.30s]  Hold on I'm in I'm I'm like halfway through um Hoth. Stop being so Hothal.
[11857.10s -> 11874.39s]  Am I flying this? Where am I? All right gotta get 16 lasers. I just read that in the chat.
[11875.11s -> 11887.30s]  Nobody said that. That's what really would happen. Doesn't matter how good of a pilot
[11887.30s -> 11891.30s]  you are when there's like 6 000 ship shooting in random directions you're going to explode.
[11892.10s -> 11919.69s]  Wait is that a true mega lull right there? The Darth Vader theme song. Only four more where are
[11919.69s -> 11936.66s]  they? The last ones over here. That's the 34 by the way. I know how old I am. You don't have to
[11936.66s -> 11952.18s]  remind me. Where are we up to? All right that doesn't even look like Chewbacca. That looks
[11952.18s -> 11970.49s]  like cousin It from Adam's Family. All right just dodge the asteroid. Watch out for that asteroid.
[11971.37s -> 11991.16s]  All right right now inside of this ship everybody is fucking throwing up.
[11991.88s -> 12002.01s]  Because organs are out of their mouths. Even just doing that. Um how do I blow this up?
[12009.30s -> 12053.75s]  Zero gravity. Doesn't matter. There are bombs to get apparently. How do I collect them?
[12061.05s -> 12111.80s]  Any button? Oh give me it. Eat shit. What? Okay it worked. It's hard to control.
[12135.69s -> 12139.30s]  This is too intense for a kids game. There's violence in this you're right.
[12140.18s -> 12151.02s]  There's violence in this. No violence in my kids game. Only violence that I want. My kids programming.
[12152.28s -> 12170.12s]  Dappy duck getting his face blown off by a shotgun. I have to do that again. All right I'm going to
[12170.12s -> 12182.06s]  try to collect like a few of them. That's two right there. All right just go. Fuck. Can I get them back?
[12182.78s -> 12191.38s]  I can't get them back. A lot of space missions in this one. Not enough lightsaber fighting.
[12192.02s -> 12196.57s]  That's why I return to the jedis better because there's way more lightsaber fights.
[12197.29s -> 12208.82s]  That's how I determine how good of a star wars movie it is. By how many actual lightsaber fights
[12208.82s -> 12229.59s]  there are. And you love it for so free. Yep and again let's be honest with the franchise.
[12230.73s -> 12237.29s]  The lightsabers are the only thing holding this thing together. Without the lightsaber sound effects
[12238.09s -> 12261.54s]  no one cares. What about the Mandalorian? Yes I stopped caring about the Mandalorian
[12261.54s -> 12276.97s]  after the fourth episode. Haste and point. And then I picked it back up again. Did I just die?
[12278.01s -> 12288.55s]  Episode one two three. It was like all right I'm into this. This is pretty cool.
[12290.07s -> 12294.39s]  Soundtrack is incredible for the Mandalorians. I get one of the best theme songs of any new show
[12295.03s -> 12303.58s]  in a very long time. But I don't I after like episode five they were just doing the same thing
[12303.58s -> 12332.15s]  over and over again. There's no lightsaber fight. This is double score zone. I leave. Oh shit I got
[12332.15s -> 12351.88s]  him. I liked the Mandalorian. I didn't love it. I really enjoyed the first half. If I can get more
[12351.88s -> 12376.25s]  of those bombs. Episode seven and eight are the best. Season two episode two is the best. Season
[12376.25s -> 12396.57s]  two is really good. Should I give him more of a chance? I'm seeing a lot of no's. I got shot at
[12396.57s -> 12414.65s]  the midair. All right there's something to blow up right here. Secret. Check out what my dog does when
[12414.65s -> 12434.18s]  I give him a bone. Hey remember when I said that I think that the Mandalorians like does the best
[12434.18s -> 12443.03s]  new Star Wars content in a decade? Remember when I said that? I said that like after the first two
[12443.03s -> 12451.86s]  three episodes. I just lost interest. I just did. I just lost interest. I was like I was like oh
[12451.86s -> 12456.98s]  this sucks. I didn't know enough lightsabers. Not enough of this. Not enough. No I just like lost
[12456.98s -> 12482.97s]  interest. The Millennium Falcon sure has a lot of lives. Lightsabers are dumb. They are not. You
[12482.97s -> 12504.87s]  like them. You're up gaslighting yourself. I do. I do. I'm telling you I do love the
[12518.14s -> 12521.26s]  you guys are telling me that I don't watch the Mandalorian and I just don't. I did the
[12521.58s -> 12528.95s]  the you don't know what that is but I'm the one that lost interest. Unbelievable.
[12545.67s -> 12550.31s]  That was sort of obvious. I apologize. That was kind of Peter Griffin.
[12557.75s -> 12585.75s]  Oh man. Stop talking over cutscenes. Oh whatever. We saw baby Yoda on your Reddit shelf.
[12586.47s -> 12607.06s]  I like baby Yoda. Reddit shelf. Reddit shelf. Oh Normie. Now all of a sudden I'm Normie. Oh I like
[12607.06s -> 12615.06s]  oh Mandalorian. I lost interest in the Mandalorian. What the fuck? Fuck you. What are you stupid?
[12615.94s -> 12623.54s]  I think baby Yoda was like really cute and fun. Normie Reddit shelf user. We've got a Normie.
[12624.50s -> 12643.72s]  Normie alert. So if I don't like the Mandalorian I'm an asshole but if I do if I love the Mandalorian
[12643.72s -> 12658.46s]  I'm a Normie. Is there a middle ground? This guy likes Home Alone 2. I love Home Alone 2. I love
[12658.46s -> 12662.62s]  both Home Alones. I think they're fantastic. I would love to watch them on stream if I was allowed
[12662.62s -> 12669.10s]  to. I find them they're required reading for this stream. Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2 are required
[12669.10s -> 12684.04s]  reading for this stream. If you haven't seen them you have to go watch them. Home Alone 2 is terrible.
[12684.12s -> 12694.07s]  Don't know. I mean it's not as good as Home Alone 1. Just like Gremlins and especially Gremlins 2
[12694.07s -> 12700.41s]  is required reading on this stream. If you do not like Gremlins 2 and you are watching this stream
[12700.41s -> 12706.90s]  right now and you you're like here I can't I can't believe that. I don't I cannot there's no way I
[12706.90s -> 12717.53s]  could believe that. When like Hulk Hogan comes and like tells like the Gremlins when he's in the movie
[12717.53s -> 12722.78s]  theater like cut the shit because they fucking with the projector. How could you not like that?
[12722.78s -> 12739.93s]  It's like it's hysterical. You ruined it. That's like one of five thousand gags that are in that
[12739.93s -> 12770.54s]  movie. I'm not a powerful force user yet. I can't lift this up. Was that a bat? I kind of like this
[12770.54s -> 12783.21s]  level. I like the scenery. We're about to meet Yoda. That's not Yoda by the way if you're curious.
[12784.82s -> 12808.52s]  That's Yoda's like goofy cousin who's like a tax accountant or something. Wait can I get that?
[12811.19s -> 12826.47s]  Dove head first into the poison. Wait R2. R2 can you get that? You can't.
[12837.11s -> 12854.12s]  That was the sounded like it was starting. Where do I go? Wait Yoda go get that. Yoda you have to
[12854.12s -> 12881.40s]  be able to do something. Not Yoda. Um R2-D2. What am I supposed to do? R2-D2 can hover?
[12883.24s -> 12886.84s]  You know I don't know that because I didn't play for more than five seconds with R2-D2.
[12887.88s -> 12896.42s]  Okay good. Good to know. His favorite franchise. No I didn't say that was my favorite franchise.
[12897.38s -> 12942.26s]  Did I? What is my favorite franchise? Uh Niners Drive-Ins and Dives. Come here. Nice.
[12957.03s -> 12969.67s]  Classic song. This is the Luke theme. You know I was in the theater and they played Luke's theme.
[12970.39s -> 12973.19s]  Just started fucking screaming.
[12991.46s -> 13031.03s]  He's just a little giggling. It's Mr. Bean. Mr. Bean. What the hell? Am I supposed to do that?
[13031.99s -> 13046.60s]  Wait fix this. If you want to know my secrets, kill that droid that you're with. I can't. He's
[13046.60s -> 13070.25s]  R2. He won't be learning anything then. I'm sorry dude. What was he teaching me? How to lift up
[13070.25s -> 13090.89s]  things? I'm not strong enough. What was he doing? I don't know. I don't know how to do math anymore.
[13091.53s -> 13119.69s]  I think I stole that from somewhere. Where did I steal it from? Me. This family guy when Chris
[13119.69s -> 13138.73s]  sticks an army figurine up his nose. Okay so those of you guys that didn't see this, I'm just gonna
[13138.73s -> 13143.74s]  say it because like I find it to be funny and I don't care if nobody else does.
[13146.97s -> 13151.93s]  In pre-stream chat one time we talked about like doing family dinner too but the only difference
[13151.93s -> 13157.69s]  was it was just me and a bunch of actors dressed up as family guy characters and I was Peter
[13159.11s -> 13163.91s]  and we just it wasn't even me it was just the family dinner but we were just doing family guy
[13164.47s -> 13170.50s]  and there would be like pre-recorded videos of like cutbacks, reference callbacks to like cutaways
[13171.38s -> 13174.57s]  so it would be it would just be it would be the same thing like family dinner too.
[13175.29s -> 13182.09s]  It's still us but we're also kind of like the Griffin family and it would be unbearable for
[13182.09s -> 13189.00s]  you for like fucking two or three hours and we'd just be like oh that reminds me of the time like
[13189.00s -> 13192.84s]  it would be me as Peter Griffin but it's me it's not I'm not I'm not actually being Peter
[13192.84s -> 13209.88s]  Griffin I'm Jeremy Albertson. I got real close to pulling trigger on that one. All right Yoda come
[13209.88s -> 13225.54s]  here. Did Yoda just kill me? Oh all right Yoda come here. Get on me. We fly? Wait I have Yoda's
[13225.54s -> 13229.86s]  okay when I wear Yoda on my head I get extra power he's like a he's like wearing a piece
[13229.86s -> 13252.58s]  of tin foil he's like an antenna. Yoda can you move like a little to the left? How do we how
[13252.58s -> 13277.82s]  do I do anything? Not even my favorite movie anymore. Can we touch this? Why would they have
[13277.82s -> 13293.58s]  bats in there? Why would you keep bats in here? R2 can fly. Yeah I know R2 can fly but I mean
[13294.94s -> 13299.42s]  how that seems like too far for him to go. Wait he can he's he doesn't die from the poison.
[13319.32s -> 13330.12s]  I'm gonna get copy striked. I'm not whatever I'm not gonna get copy striked.
[13331.96s -> 13357.27s]  Humming the Mandalorian theme song. Like he's humming a song. Don't ever listen to the radio
[13357.27s -> 13384.34s]  ever again. Listening to the radio is illegal. All right I got it. Based and poopy pill.
[13386.74s -> 13397.18s]  Thanks I guess. Well how do I get over there now? Wait what? R2 you didn't even do anything you
[13397.18s -> 13417.80s]  just like gave us get off me. Oh shit just killed Yoda. Yoda I'm sorry. Yoda never ending like
[13418.60s -> 13430.89s]  torture device for Yoda. I'll help you. I'll get you up just grab my hand. Um I don't think
[13431.53s -> 13439.03s]  I don't think I can actually help him. Help him R2. Get in the way so he bounces off of you.
[13444.04s -> 13452.38s]  How did I get soft locked in this game? I don't understand. If I run too far away he won't
[13453.82s -> 13461.69s]  he'll have to get spawned somewhere else right? I'm just trying to go far enough away where he
[13461.69s -> 13489.32s]  gets pulled. Why can I not walk? All right he'll get pulled eventually. Pull him. Pull back. I
[13489.32s -> 13505.10s]  think I actually have to restart this. And R2's just over there like oh what a bunch of
[13505.82s -> 13530.42s]  fucking idiots. That's over I have to restart. Restart. I can't switch to Yoda. Episode four.
[13530.42s -> 13553.51s]  Look we're only like a few episodes later. Come on. Hey Joe it's Star Wars. I can't skip the cut
[13553.51s -> 13589.13s]  scene. Stop saying that. You literally did not need Yoda for that part. Didn't? Watch out. Can
[13589.13s -> 13601.10s]  someone tell him? Tell him what? All right speed run. Just get to Yoda. Get the get the coins too.
[13601.10s -> 13629.61s]  No just go. Yoda percent. No no don't have this happen to him now please.
[13630.81s -> 13659.67s]  Jump out. Those are some pretty good fucking moves. Watch out episode four. I couldn't get
[13659.67s -> 13666.30s]  past the Death Star level. Well you were eight. I'm 34. I don't think I'll have that much of a
[13666.30s -> 13689.85s]  problem. Can we cut to me like raging and I can't do it. Oh you're not dead. I'm gonna let this play
[13689.85s -> 13702.44s]  out for a second because uh this is just chasing around a fly in the house. Why is it still alive?
[13711.08s -> 13736.49s]  God. A plant. Right I just. Latch on man. You're making me look really bad.
[13739.14s -> 13753.67s]  You look terrible. Stupid dog. You make me look bad.
[13759.83s -> 13792.42s]  Oh courage. You can do better than that. What is that accent? I'm getting showing up. All right
[13792.42s -> 13801.35s]  new year's resolution. No more screaming. You guys understand? No more of that. No more screaming.
[13801.35s -> 13807.08s]  I'm not gonna scream anymore. I'm just gonna chill. I'll be just hanging out playing a game.
[13807.08s -> 13813.56s]  Just chilling. No more yelling and like. Like no. I'm done with that. No more.
[13815.85s -> 13840.73s]  Kids eat this shit up don't they? No emotion. No. All right no talking. Do you think I can do it?
[13840.73s -> 13846.31s]  No talking for five minutes. I can't say anything. No speaking for five minutes. You don't think you
[13846.31s -> 13853.54s]  think it's possible? Okay at three at three hours and 52 minutes on the stream I'm gonna
[13853.54s -> 14021.13s]  not talk for five straight minutes. Okay here we go. I have to talk. You know when you watch like a
[14021.13s -> 14026.79s]  gameplay walkthrough of something that you're stuck on and you find a channel like this that
[14026.79s -> 14031.59s]  you're just like skipping through this person's like two hour long video which is like dude what
[14031.59s -> 14037.50s]  do you fucking how do you do this? You're doing terrible. I just want to see what what the next
[14037.50s -> 14281.32s]  puzzle part is and you can't you can't even do it. This is a walkthrough. All right this video has
[14282.73s -> 14290.78s]  four views. You if you were looking for that if you were a kid and you were looking at how to beat
[14290.78s -> 14296.38s]  this part after you just leave you'd be like all right well I guess I'm gonna figure it out on my
[14296.38s -> 14309.51s]  own. I need Yoda back. Somebody said gaining viewers. That you know what that was actually
[14309.51s -> 14322.14s]  kind of nice. That was like a talking break. How do I feel? That was pretty good. It's like
[14322.14s -> 14328.20s]  this is quiet for like 10 almost 10 minutes. That felt that was like a nice break. Do that more often.
[14340.22s -> 14350.36s]  Those two minutes? No it was not. I started doing that at 352 on stream. I gotta get him up here.
[14350.92s -> 14364.81s]  I have to put Yoda. All right hey get on this. Get on that. No what the fuck? That's not what I
[14364.81s -> 14387.34s]  wanted to do. Why did he just why did Yoda jump all the way back there? I can't lower this. I need
[14387.34s -> 14405.24s]  Yoda on my head to lower that but R2D2 didn't go on it. It's gonna be in the walkthrough? Yeah.
[14409.66s -> 14417.06s]  I'm not recording my mic. I'm capturing the game only. I have it split. I have uh the audio split
[14417.06s -> 14439.66s]  so it's not capturing my fucking voice. All right let's go. Editors do the right thing.
[14441.05s -> 14452.79s]  All right R2 get over here before I scrap you. Get on it. All right R2D2 go on that. All right
[14452.79s -> 14475.05s]  R2D2 go on that. How do I jump with R2D2? Let's jump. Start. Okay it's five on the d-pad.
[14486.78s -> 14509.13s]  What? What the fuck? You have to move with me. All right but how come he won't go on that with
[14509.13s -> 14525.18s]  the computer controller? I don't understand. This walkthrough sucks. All that matters is you just
[14525.18s -> 14575.11s]  skip to the part that you need to see. All right go on there R2D2. Who? R2D2? What? R2 what the fuck?
[14575.67s -> 14582.55s]  This sucks. This is so like this. They didn't do it good enough. What do you want me to say?
[14582.55s -> 14600.09s]  Okay what do you want me to say? Throw the controller into the ground. I have not any
[14600.09s -> 14605.53s]  trouble at all for four hours until the stupid swamp level. And of course, of course it's a
[14605.53s -> 14611.45s]  swamp level. All game developers. I don't care if it matches the fucking scene for scene of the movie.
[14611.45s -> 14620.44s]  Don't do swamp levels ever. They're all terrible. Make it concrete. I don't care if it matches the
[14620.44s -> 14642.76s]  movie scene for scene. Make it like grass. This is the walkthrough? Oh shit it is. That's right I
[14642.76s -> 14658.01s]  forgot. All right I'm supposed to not laugh this hard today. Watch a walkthrough to make
[14658.89s -> 14673.27s]  my walkthrough. No don't kill me. R2 get on that. I can't switch to R2 because I you don't
[14673.27s -> 14691.11s]  understand. I don't have two people here. Okay R2 get the fuck on that. R2 get on. Don't spawn
[14691.11s -> 14709.85s]  any fucking bats. Why won't he go on this one R2? Stand on that one. What the fuck is he doing?
[14724.60s -> 14729.40s]  What is he doing? Why won't he jump on this one first and then this one? That's what he's supposed
[14729.40s -> 14745.66s]  to do. Switch to R2. What if I switch back from R2? Okay I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I
[14745.66s -> 14750.06s]  get it. I get it. Fuck the goddamn swamp level. All swamp levels suck. If I ever make a video game
[14750.06s -> 14755.26s]  I'm gonna have the swamp level be first. The first level in the game and then what happens is
[14755.26s -> 14758.78s]  the swamp level before you even start it's like here we are. We're at the swamp.
[14758.78s -> 14763.74s]  Everyone loves these. Then you get to start and then a fucking nuclear bomb drops in front of you
[14764.30s -> 14775.90s]  and it's just and then you do skip that level and then like a portal opens on the left and it's
[14775.90s -> 14778.86s]  like oh it looks like we can't go this way through the swamp. Let's try this portal.
[14779.90s -> 14787.99s]  What the fuck? I get hit twice. Why? Seriously I get hit touched twice by bats and Yoda
[14787.99s -> 14802.66s]  fucking yeets off of me. I'm so bad right now because like this is I hate this thing.
[14804.54s -> 14810.06s]  Why are there even bats here? What's the point? This is children's game. Quiet.
[14810.62s -> 14816.54s]  Shh. I'm fine. Everybody relax. I'm so tilted right now and I have to calm down.
[14817.42s -> 14825.21s]  This is not hard. It's just stupid. It's very dumb. It's that this I loved I you know episode
[14825.21s -> 14828.73s]  five is not in my favorite fucking movie anymore. Episode one was way better.

[16798.34s -> 16815.98s]  on the age group r2 d2 carries the kid crowd and so does Chewbacca but I would probably say
[16815.98s -> 16821.98s]  the adult crowd like who carries the franchise for the adults probably Han Solo that's definitely
[16821.98s -> 16854.89s]  Han Solo I can't even see I get him oh shit get that in double jump I'm losing tons of money I

[16996.44s -> 17034.26s]  best strategy this is just this is doing the running boot in battle toads are you you know
[17034.26s -> 17041.80s]  it's really weird about this I forget what happens after that I can't wait did he just groin hit
