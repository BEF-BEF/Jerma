[1174.45s -> 1181.92s]  That was one of my favorites. Yeah
[1182.00s -> 1186.42s]  The trash man
[1186.42s -> 1190.29s]  Okay, let's go. Wait, I didn't go in here. You're the bug guy, right?
[1190.77s -> 1196.93s]  She's more beast than prison now. Did I go in here? Yes. All right, so let me leave
[1197.01s -> 1207.72s]  I got what I wanted. Let's explore the rest of this place the bird sound
[1208.20s -> 1213.40s]  You know the bird sound I actually am sad that I did because a sub sound is like, okay
[1213.48s -> 1215.48s]  everybody pause for a second the
[1215.96s -> 1219.91s]  We're gonna the funny line is gonna be said the bird sound
[1220.55s -> 1226.90s]  Ruined old streams because it was just noise that just would happen randomly instead of it being like
[1227.38s -> 1232.66s]  I'm in the middle of saying something or talking. It's oh, hey guys. And by the way, here's what we're what
[1234.26s -> 1237.70s]  The trash man everybody stops and we just listen to it for a second
[1238.02s -> 1242.58s]  But eventually it got to a point where it was so in the background
[1243.36s -> 1246.00s]  That you would just randomly talking over me would be like
[1250.18s -> 1257.73s]  I've gone back and watched old vods and gone. Oh, but turn that off. Okay, so I looked at that
[1257.81s -> 1259.09s]  Let's look at this
[1259.09s -> 1279.59s]  Can I go that way? Whoa, can I not leave yet? Can we just listen to this for a second? You watch yourself?
[1280.88s -> 1284.08s]  No, but sometimes I'll go back and just check on old vods and stuff
[1284.08s -> 1287.60s]  You know, you never know. I just want to know I want to see if what kind of
[1289.43s -> 1293.43s]  Something interesting too is I've been doing this for like 12 13 years now
[1293.59s -> 1298.31s]  That's kind of interesting sometimes just to go back and be like what was I like like five years ago two years ago
[1298.39s -> 1300.39s]  Eight years ago interesting sometimes
[1300.95s -> 1309.67s]  So looking at old photos. I mean, I don't do this that often
[1309.99s -> 1313.78s]  This is maybe like once every maybe like once every year or two
[1313.86s -> 1326.56s]  I'll go back and look at some stuff interesting and we've done this on stream before. What do you mean?

[2061.30s -> 2066.10s]  To a little thing I did on the dollhouse stream. I mean that wasn't a dance
[2066.18s -> 2075.22s]  That was just you guys called it that so I mean, is that really a dance? I said it
[2075.54s -> 2089.09s]  Did I make that up? No, I didn't. All right. So I think I think I saw everything I need to see here
[2089.09s -> 2097.48s]  Let me see. What about the pick? Can I take the paper cup anywhere here? I feel like I might be able to
[2097.48s -> 2116.53s]  What about can I go that way like up there? How do I get down there? All right, I gotta find a way up there
[2141.32s -> 2167.96s]  Get out of the way cult permits nothing to leave mournful in this way. They hope to promote a reverse erosion. What's this stuff?
[2174.03s -> 2179.06s]  Everybody's hitting the yoinkies flunky. Oh, this is mount mournful

[2277.11s -> 2286.15s]  I don't think this is a tv the cup you found it. I'm an expert in the usage of the paper cup
[2286.39s -> 2293.96s]  Please allow me to accompany you one day. We may come across another artifact from the old times which will require the paper cup

[2398.66s -> 2414.98s]  Should we use the paper cup here?
[2414.98s -> 2420.53s]  We can use a paper cup with this machine your companion places the paper cup into a recess on the front of the machine and
[2420.95s -> 2427.83s]  presses a small blue lever fluid flows from the reservoir into the paper cup you drink it and

[2834.82s -> 2836.45s]  Oh, no, we're good
[2836.45s -> 2841.83s]  Did they all fall asleep? Okay, two of them did
[2848.26s -> 2850.66s]  All right. We gotta we we gotta do some damage
[2852.64s -> 2854.71s]  calibration on you
[2854.71s -> 2857.72s]  and then you do
[2857.78s -> 2859.08s]  shurikens
[2859.08s -> 2863.48s]  Here it is. Oops. I don't know the I don't know the order. Oh, um, oops it is
[2864.36s -> 2871.64s]  Why they wait, they all got it. Wait, why did they all get it? They all got it. What just happened
[2872.72s -> 2875.88s]  They all just got it

[2882.98s -> 2885.30s]  They get it from okay. They got it from the statue. I was gonna say what?
[2887.67s -> 2890.36s]  Come on, man

[2892.36s -> 2906.56s]  Juice box, right? Yeah
[2906.56s -> 2911.75s]  Cool. All right, they're asleep
[2914.79s -> 2916.79s]  Now I now that I have mightiness up
[2917.84s -> 2919.84s]  Let's do this
[2920.00s -> 2923.67s]  That's gonna be huge
[2923.67s -> 2925.67s]  54 damage right now get out of here
[2927.25s -> 2930.29s]  Oh that one was asleep. I'm an idiot. It's all right. I'll get it. I figured it out
[2931.01s -> 2941.96s]  I don't think I need to eat anything or I think i'm good
[2947.76s -> 2949.76s]  Backgrounds are really trippy. They're really crazy
[2954.79s -> 2956.44s]  All right
[2956.44s -> 2958.44s]  I think I want to go buy stuff
[2958.68s -> 2961.06s]  Is there anywhere I can go from here? Is it just that's it?
[2961.62s -> 2986.77s]  I think that's it. I did the paper cup here. I already got it. Yeah, I have a lot of money
[2986.85s -> 2996.12s]  I'm gonna go buy stuff. I want to watch this but the visuals are giving me a headache
[2996.52s -> 3000.74s]  Should there be something in the title? It just says like the you know, hey like
[3001.86s -> 3006.23s]  Visuals are like kind of trippy or something. Probably not a bad idea
[3006.71s -> 3015.54s]  I guess it's not too too bad, right? Not enough for like a warning
[3016.34s -> 3018.76s]  I don't know. What do you guys think?
[3018.76s -> 3033.41s]  Maybe like an eye strain warning
[3034.37s -> 3037.38s]  It's fine. It's fine. It's fine
[3040.21s -> 3042.45s]  It doesn't seem dangerous. No, I don't think so
[3045.54s -> 3046.90s]  eye strain
[3046.90s -> 3048.90s]  warning eye strain incoming
[3049.46s -> 3053.94s]  I said this actually is fine for me. I'm very sensitive to stuff like this and I've
[3054.42s -> 3070.48s]  Um, i've been okay
[3070.48s -> 3072.08s]  oops
[3072.08s -> 3074.44s]  I didn't mean to do what did I just do skip?
[3077.33s -> 3079.33s]  warning don't watch
[3084.37s -> 3085.65s]  Stop missing
[3085.65s -> 3088.08s]  Oh my god, we're gonna die
[3088.08s -> 3091.72s]  finally
[3091.72s -> 3095.56s]  Oh my god
[3095.56s -> 3097.56s]  Are we this oh wicked with blind?
[3099.48s -> 3101.00s]  Okay, well
[3101.00s -> 3112.07s]  You know something that removes this status effects, right?
[3124.15s -> 3128.28s]  Veggies do
[3128.28s -> 3130.28s]  I have a lot of money
[3131.19s -> 3170.90s]  We gotta go. I have like a couple at least two or three thousand bucks. Don't I? All right. What do you sell? Okay
[3171.52s -> 3174.66s]  turbo tendons
[3174.66s -> 3176.66s]  allows where to wield two weapons
[3177.99s -> 3184.52s]  20% of where's normal attacks inflict poison. Okay, so should should somebody have poison or is this too expensive for right now?
[3185.16s -> 3202.96s]  Get cellophane how many like two three? I don't want to spend that much. All right, i'll get two
[3209.30s -> 3212.90s]  This is i'm gonna get this so I want someone to have that
[3213.06s -> 3230.15s]  So this is this prevents blind and this is poison poison damage and then they no prevents blind set
[3230.15s -> 3258.76s]  That's actually huge right now anything else for me to purchase. There's another strap too in there. Yeah, what do you got l?
[3261.41s -> 3276.88s]  Giant metal dome apparel too large to be worn with any other armor. What does it do plus 50 plus 50 what armor?
[3282.37s -> 3284.36s]  I mean, that's pretty good
[3284.36s -> 3293.43s]  So but I can't wear this with anything else so I wouldn't be able to have this and the sunglasses on i'll get it
[3293.67s -> 3326.18s]  Okay, is that worth it? What is it? What stats is it increasing 30 30 everything looks the same
[3326.26s -> 3347.59s]  It's just an armor rating. Well, might as well give that to you. It's flesh slash health. Oh, okay
[3347.99s -> 3359.27s]  Oh that may okay. Look at 140 health. Holy smokes. That's a lot. My tortoise is watching this stream
[3359.51s -> 3372.90s]  She hates you but I think she likes the game. Okay, I think that's good
[3373.14s -> 3386.18s]  Can I where do I buy vegetables like i'm running out? Is there another there's another store here, right?
[3386.34s -> 3398.87s]  Or can you only get them from the garden? They grow infinitely. Oh that I was gonna say that makes sense
[3398.87s -> 3414.60s]  Um, um, um, somebody said that song was scratching their frontal lobe. I feel like I may have missed a secret or two here
[3427.59s -> 3432.32s]  Maybe I have trashcan
[3432.48s -> 3461.09s]  I already got it. Didn't I or is there another trash can? Oh there is 47 bucks in here. Check the tv again
[3464.10s -> 3490.04s]  Okay, something else. Um, all right now i'm pretty decked out now. I'm going to do that other stuff
[3490.20s -> 3496.47s]  I'm going to where I got in trouble last time. That's a good idea and we're probably
[3497.11s -> 3502.44s]  I think i'm gonna show some grotto bee stuff talk about it for a little bit. I think I was gonna wait like an hour
[3506.84s -> 3513.25s]  We've got to go over some questions and some answers. I want to show the box. I have it here
[3513.41s -> 3520.74s]  We can go over some stuff like give me one second. I'm gonna this can just stay right here
[3524.55s -> 3528.39s]  Yeah, we'll come right back to this. I just want to show
[3529.03s -> 3535.91s]  Actually, let me get that here. All right, I want to go over
[3537.81s -> 3544.08s]  Since grotto beasts has gone into presale. I really want to go over some of the more
[3544.90s -> 3551.48s]  Some amendments to that faq and this this whole thing is going to get pieced together in any of this faq stuff that you guys
[3551.48s -> 3553.48s]  Have seen so far will be on the website
[3553.56s -> 3555.16s]  We just want to clean it up and make sure it's correct
[3555.16s -> 3558.40s]  but there's a lot of stuff to go over because
[3559.48s -> 3564.12s]  We have uh, we have hit a very very interesting milestone and uh, we'll talk about it
[3564.79s -> 3568.70s]  So let's start we're gonna start at the top. Here comes another presentation
[3570.34s -> 3580.80s]  Presentation incoming it is only one slide this time. So don't worry. It's not like 10 slides. Let's
[3581.36s -> 3589.30s]  Do that right now. Let me get it up. It's only one slide
[3589.30s -> 3590.85s]  Yeah
[3590.85s -> 3594.85s]  There were just some other things we wanted to make sure people were aware of and i'm just going to read this stuff pretty much
[3594.85s -> 3602.31s]  Line by line powerpoint. Okay, let me get it up here
[3606.58s -> 3609.62s]  Okay
[3609.62s -> 3611.96s]  Okay
[3611.96s -> 3617.12s]  Okay, let's go over this because these are this is going to answer some questions
[3617.84s -> 3627.48s]  And go over some important, um store updates dates and limited items. Okay, so there's a lot of text on this screen
[3627.64s -> 3631.22s]  So just be aware. I want to get it on one slide. Here we go
[3632.93s -> 3639.76s]  Here are some clarifications and amendments to what we talked about two three days ago. So
[3640.64s -> 3648.23s]  Grotto beasts is in presale right now. It's available right now on grottobeasts.net. This is very yeah, there's a lot of text
[3648.95s -> 3649.91s]  I'm gonna read it
[3649.91s -> 3656.47s]  So we've had a lot of questions since this and don't skip ahead. Don't skip. I know you're gonna read ahead
[3656.55s -> 3664.12s]  Don't skip ahead wait for me to read. Oh shit cartoon mischief
[3665.57s -> 3668.13s]  All right, so we've had a lot of questions about the holographics
[3669.12s -> 3674.72s]  Wait, you've got four different holographic types. Does that mean that each card could have a holographic and four different versions?
[3674.88s -> 3683.46s]  No, there are four types of holographic film and each card has a specific holographic film type assigned to it
[3683.78s -> 3693.94s]  So for example, you will you should never find a fretsal right here that has anything but a hollow dot pattern
[3694.26s -> 3697.57s]  So I think a lot of people were saying whoa
[3697.73s -> 3703.49s]  That seems like a lot of potential holographics for if it's each one has the no, no, no, they're all assigned
[3706.74s -> 3709.22s]  So that we've had that question come in a lot
[3709.46s -> 3717.30s]  So we've also we've numbered our production so that every booster pack will have one rare card and exactly one holographic card in every booster pack
[3717.62s -> 3724.20s]  So what that means the hollow is one random card which can be either rare or common so some packs
[3724.68s -> 3728.32s]  Will potentially have two rares. We've got that question a lot too
[3730.93s -> 3733.17s]  Now for some store updates
[3734.80s -> 3737.04s]  Let's go over some updates on the store
[3737.83s -> 3744.45s]  Uh, do not read the second line yet. I know you already have but it's fucking crazy
[3746.56s -> 3751.44s]  We are going to let everyone know when we have an exact date in mind for the presale to end
[3751.92s -> 3756.28s]  The store may halt for a while in that period and depending on inventory
[3756.36s -> 3760.60s]  We'll need to see what items will be available for when we leave presale up
[3760.84s -> 3763.99s]  This will be at least 10 to 14 days from now
[3764.23s -> 3770.80s]  So we don't have a hard date for the end of the presale, but it will be at least another two weeks
[3772.85s -> 3774.85s]  So if you are buying it right now
[3776.44s -> 3778.76s]  We're trying to keep the presale up as long as we can
[3779.16s -> 3782.12s]  And the reason why we're doing that is because of the second line here
[3783.44s -> 3789.19s]  So the initial production of the boosters have all been claimed
[3790.60s -> 3795.00s]  So the boosters of of our first production run here have been claimed
[3796.45s -> 3797.41s]  So
[3797.41s -> 3801.51s]  We're already in contact with the printer to scale up the production and order more
[3802.42s -> 3805.06s]  We want I want to touch again on this presale strategy. It's important
[3806.02s -> 3809.14s]  We didn't want our inventory currently in production to sell out
[3809.70s -> 3816.50s]  Ship out and have a secondary market takeover for people that didn't get in on the presale and wanted to claim items
[3816.90s -> 3819.97s]  This presale is going to continue normally
[3820.05s -> 3825.19s]  But those of you buying booster packs now, which is over our current inventory
[3826.45s -> 3829.09s]  You're going to need to wait a little longer for the till the next order
[3830.24s -> 3832.08s]  Uh, we'll get some better dates for you in the near future
[3832.08s -> 3835.84s]  But I we want to make sure we can make this really clear that there's going to be a waiting period
[3836.16s -> 3843.09s]  For boosters purchased as of this period now after the first shipments go out. This is very corporate
[3843.49s -> 3845.65s]  It has to be because I want to make sure I get this correct
[3847.12s -> 3849.11s]  so
[3849.11s -> 3852.55s]  That being said the availability the
[3854.07s -> 3856.07s]  This is not corporate anymore
[3856.79s -> 3862.40s]  The availability of the two player starter kits as I just heard holly laugh
[3863.32s -> 3866.68s]  As of this stream right now are not affected by the new production order
[3867.73s -> 3871.86s]  So people are still claiming through the stock and each kit has two boosters in it
[3872.93s -> 3876.05s]  So right now we've not gone through all of the starter kits
[3876.69s -> 3880.77s]  So those you're still fine if you if you're during the presale buying them now if you do
[3881.62s -> 3885.22s]  Uh, those as well as the first run of boosters are planning to ship out after the presale ends
[3886.61s -> 3891.09s]  So the starter kits are still available and it's not that boosters are not available
[3891.57s -> 3893.57s]  It's just the the second order
[3894.05s -> 3897.89s]  Of boosters is gonna you you'll get it later
[3897.97s -> 3900.77s]  It's gonna be a I don't want to give you a date because we don't really know
[3901.25s -> 3908.47s]  But it shouldn't be that long, but it will be a little longer. So we want to make sure people know this
[3909.70s -> 3910.72s]  also
[3910.72s -> 3914.04s]  Important some of the we didn't make well
[3914.04s -> 3920.29s]  I want to make sure we mentioned this some of the apparel and prints are only available for a limited time until march 31st
[3921.40s -> 3926.18s]  So the the 40 the original 40 beast shirts the art prints
[3926.58s -> 3933.65s]  The grotto beast logo hat and beanies and the glow in the dark version of that ghost hoodie and tee
[3934.63s -> 3945.65s]  Are all leaving the store on the 31st. That's the plan now. I want to talk about this
[3946.47s -> 3948.77s]  Get off my screen get off my screen
[3951.20s -> 3954.72s]  So the age rating on the box, I want to make this really clear
[3956.07s -> 3960.07s]  So it's listed as six plus as more of a guideline for the physical product
[3960.47s -> 3965.28s]  There are dice in here. We wanted people to make sure that there are small pieces in here
[3967.04s -> 3971.12s]  Because if you bought this and that and there was no like, you know minimum sort of age rating on it
[3971.94s -> 3975.94s]  There are there are small physical pieces in here and we just want to make sure people know that
[3978.82s -> 3980.02s]  also
[3980.02s -> 3987.72s]  Very important. This is a mature audience channel and although there are no pieces of explicit language or imagery
[3988.93s -> 3995.65s]  There are still references to tobacco cartoon violence cartoon mischief. It's it's stream references
[3996.95s -> 3998.95s]  So if you're like think about that, right?
[3999.67s -> 4004.96s]  There are references to characters here that might not be appropriate for little kids
[4006.20s -> 4009.80s]  But we try to make this project be as general audience as possible
[4010.12s -> 4016.05s]  But also keep in mind this is channel merch for this community first and foremost
[4017.52s -> 4020.02s]  This is merch for you guys
[4020.02s -> 4024.98s]  Merch for the community. That's all this project ever was intended to be so just be aware
[4025.38s -> 4029.54s]  That there are references to mature audience streams, even though we tried
[4030.10s -> 4039.09s]  To make this as general audience as we could you understand do you feel me outrage tobacco?
[4040.29s -> 4042.95s]  But you know, we want to make this clear for people
[4043.78s -> 4049.43s]  There are definitely going to be people that stumble upon this project and just potentially have no idea who the fuck I am
[4050.87s -> 4054.58s]  We just want people to know this
[4054.58s -> 4056.58s]  I do not understand
[4059.97s -> 4061.48s]  so
[4061.48s -> 4070.44s]  With all this being said are we clear on this stuff? Are we clear on these? Is everybody clear?
[4070.92s -> 4075.91s]  Can you please put this into simpler terms?
[4077.60s -> 4079.28s]  Um, no, I can't
[4079.28s -> 4081.65s]  That'll get me in trouble
[4084.68s -> 4087.88s]  No, I cannot because I want to make sure we're very clear on what's happening
[4088.20s -> 4093.56s]  I'll look over at the grotto bees group chat and it'll be in all capitals
[4094.04s -> 4103.52s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop. Can you explain this in family guy terms? No, I don't think I I don't think I can so
[4104.32s -> 4106.60s]  I it's time
[4106.60s -> 4112.16s]  I want to show you some things. He makes us sound so angry. No, they're i'm kidding
[4112.40s -> 4115.36s]  It's been it's a they're a wonderful group over there. I promise. I'm just kidding around
[4118.20s -> 4125.68s]  They are I have some things here that I would like to show you guys ready
[4126.00s -> 4130.55s]  Are you ready for me to reveal it? Stop bumping the mic. I'm not trying to
[4132.39s -> 4138.52s]  I'm gonna show you multiple things because it's kind of interesting how this plays out just sip my drink
[4140.45s -> 4149.57s]  Okay, let's go like this. Let's go like this
[4151.68s -> 4154.60s]  And then let's go like this
[4155.32s -> 4165.81s]  Oh, they can see me. Hold on. Hold on
[4167.08s -> 4173.67s]  Hi, how are you? Where are you? Where the heck are you? No, you're up there. Good to see you again
[4174.63s -> 4180.24s]  Uh, we're gonna go over the box. You got a full beard. It's hey, it's been kind of a wild couple of weeks
[4180.56s -> 4186.80s]  I'm not I haven't shaved or anything. I've had a haircut. We're just i'm sorry. That's just the way it is
[4187.04s -> 4196.76s]  Is it really delayed? It shouldn't be. Oh, maybe the last time I used my face cam was let me see
[4203.78s -> 4206.98s]  No, that should be fine
[4206.98s -> 4209.70s]  Don't it shouldn't be that's not delayed. What are you talking about? That's fine. What do you mean?
[4210.34s -> 4218.55s]  All right. So let's all right. You ready? Sure, but you're ugly. I want to show you
[4219.51s -> 4224.02s]  Now don't look yet. I want to show you the first iteration of the box
[4224.26s -> 4230.58s]  I'm gonna get to see behind the curtain here. So this is what the box looked like
[4231.30s -> 4236.71s]  Originally, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, so here it is
[4237.54s -> 4242.48s]  So this is the original grotto beast box looks pretty cool, right?
[4242.88s -> 4247.27s]  This is the first iteration and I want to show you like it's it's all right
[4247.59s -> 4253.80s]  It's kind of it's kind of sturdy but not that sturdy and as you can see
[4256.29s -> 4257.57s]  It's not
[4257.57s -> 4261.96s]  We didn't we weren't really happy with this. We wanted there to be something interesting in here
[4263.86s -> 4270.85s]  This is where the dice were gonna go in here in this little thing, but it turned out to be kind of annoying
[4271.83s -> 4275.28s]  Uh, it turned out to kind of it could get like kind of squished. So we decided
[4275.92s -> 4282.10s]  Maybe let's do another version right another iteration. It just it just doesn't it just it really just didn't do it for us
[4282.79s -> 4284.79s]  And obviously if i'm gonna charge
[4285.33s -> 4287.35s]  79 fucking dollars for something like that
[4287.67s -> 4292.07s]  I want to make at least fucking some you know, make it make a quality if I can right
[4292.39s -> 4296.36s]  Because I didn't we didn't want to sell this for 80 bucks. No fucking way. That was not gonna happen
[4297.06s -> 4307.84s]  So but we thought okay, what what can we do? Then we came to this one now this one
[4308.64s -> 4316.72s]  The you can even hear it the material is a lot sturdier. This is this is the box. This is the real box
[4317.81s -> 4322.98s]  So in here, I want to maybe I can show you the difference between like this
[4323.46s -> 4327.24s]  Here they are on top of each other like you might not be able to see the difference
[4327.24s -> 4333.64s]  But you can definitely feel it. This is a little I want to say flimsier. This one is it's hard. It's sturdier
[4333.88s -> 4340.98s]  So then yeah, take a look. There it is. Now you're probably saying do this stuff. Where's all where's all the stuff?
[4342.56s -> 4346.88s]  This is this is a print. This is a sample. So if you take a look down there, ooh
[4348.02s -> 4352.61s]  Cool. This is what sits in the middle, which is now holding the dice
[4353.73s -> 4356.37s]  And I kind of fucked it up a little bit. So this is my own fault
[4356.93s -> 4358.53s]  This is what it sits in now
[4358.53s -> 4364.84s]  You get this little like boat and see there you see like the glowing it's like sits on top of this
[4366.12s -> 4368.44s]  This so it sits in the box like this
[4368.44s -> 4375.12s]  I fucked mine up because I was fucking with it too much but you get a dice boat that sits like this
[4376.44s -> 4378.76s]  And then there's two starter decks right here
[4380.44s -> 4382.44s]  It's pretty nice and it's a lot nicer than this
[4382.84s -> 4385.24s]  And like I said, we weren't going to sell this for 80 dollars. That would be fucking
[4385.80s -> 4389.59s]  I would I we've no way not going to happen. So here are the dice
[4389.83s -> 4400.18s]  I don't know if I can even show these that well, but here they are these dice they have can you see
[4403.59s -> 4408.12s]  There's the the print is the light's not great in here, but there's the the j
[4409.03s -> 4418.80s]  The the germa j these are fun for all your dice needs. Yeah, you can't see it
[4418.88s -> 4428.39s]  It's it's it doesn't come out that well on camera here, but they're themed dice pretty cool
[4428.79s -> 4436.71s]  So those sit in here like that and these I think these come in a little bag
[4440.21s -> 4445.16s]  They they will come in a little bag so they don't jump around too much and then
[4445.72s -> 4454.32s]  Aha is the manual the manual is right here. I don't want to show I should I open this
[4458.48s -> 4470.21s]  It's really nice. It's nice. It's kind of like acts as like a little art book too in a way
[4470.98s -> 4473.04s]  It's not an art book
[4473.04s -> 4476.34s]  But you know, they they there's a lot it's a listen
[4476.34s -> 4481.76s]  There's a lot of nice stuff in here and take a look there you go, but now this is not an art book
[4481.84s -> 4488.47s]  Let me make that really clear not an art book. It's the manual the rules for the game
[4489.09s -> 4494.24s]  But there is like some nice stuff here. Then
[4495.70s -> 4508.80s]  Here there are two play mats here is one of the play mats and this is just standard
[4509.36s -> 4513.52s]  Paper, this is not uh, like felt or something. But here's the play mat is one of them
[4515.75s -> 4530.69s]  They're pretty big and then here's the other one. They're not like felt. Here you go. Here's the
[4531.33s -> 4538.58s]  Here's the other one pretty cool pretty cool stuff and then
[4540.93s -> 4549.91s]  That's also in that box and then we get to these these are my favorite. This is my favorite part these
[4551.25s -> 4553.57s]  So I can't open these there's nothing in here
[4554.58s -> 4556.58s]  I just want to get you to see what it looks like in somebody's hand
[4558.10s -> 4566.48s]  They feel nice. The foils are cool. Take a look back. Can you get a good view? Take a look at that
[4570.12s -> 4572.68s]  There it is
[4572.68s -> 4579.83s]  These are your packs two of these come in the box. They come in the box and why don't we
[4581.22s -> 4583.22s]  No, that's my favorite part for sure
[4586.36s -> 4591.11s]  Oh also very important to mention all the cards. This is all printed and made in america
[4591.43s -> 4593.83s]  The only difference is the dice were not the dice were made in china
[4594.45s -> 4599.00s]  so everything that this whole thing was made and printed in the united states, so
[4599.64s -> 4604.15s]  That's that's cool. There you go card reveal
[4606.40s -> 4612.72s]  Is one pretty shiny feels pretty good
[4613.78s -> 4617.72s]  Give you kind of kind of a look of what they look like in somebody's hand
[4617.96s -> 4627.51s]  But if I get it really close, I wonder if I can get it close for you
[4631.09s -> 4643.60s]  And again, these are standard these are standard playing card sizes. Hey haven't even fucking seen this one yet
[4644.69s -> 4652.47s]  You haven't even seen this one yet card reveal the lighting in the room is not great
[4652.55s -> 4657.99s]  But so this is a rare I don't have any holographics to show because they're being made so I can't really show them
[4659.25s -> 4665.88s]  But this is what one looks like you want to see the back if it looks like on the back
[4667.62s -> 4675.67s]  You know if you want to hear you want to sound test sound test flip test row test
[4675.99s -> 4692.72s]  I'm gonna move it around pretty sturdy pretty solid. There you go. You want me to fan it out taste test
[4699.57s -> 4702.60s]  Oh, wait, let me show this. This is glue man
[4702.84s -> 4712.12s]  I wish the camera wasn't so bad because this it they actually the printing came out really nicely for yeah
[4712.12s -> 4716.58s]  It's full art. Yeah, the rares, uh, i've learned the rares the
[4717.32s -> 4723.41s]  Challenger cards, I believe are full right make sure make sure somebody corrects me. Can you see it?
[4723.41s -> 4736.61s]  Well, there you go. Throw it at the wall. No, this is my glue man. I'm not doing that. You crazy
[4738.60s -> 4744.69s]  Yeah, I just we wanted to show people what because I look I get it. It's 80 fucking dollars
[4744.93s -> 4751.67s]  It's 10 bucks per pack. I I want you to be able to understand what you're getting. So let's fan it out
[4752.60s -> 4759.75s]  Sorry, i'm looking over here. I have to look at the preview to make sure i'm showing it right there you go
[4760.76s -> 4770.21s]  That's what you can expect printed and made in america except for the dice
[4771.84s -> 4781.24s]  It's been it's been quite a journey. There you go. What happens if you rip the mats?
[4781.56s -> 4787.83s]  I would just be careful with them. Be careful with them. Oh also. Yeah, very very important to remember as well
[4789.19s -> 4795.11s]  That there are two full decks that are coming with this box. I just I don't have them here right now
[4796.44s -> 4798.04s]  they're not we
[4798.04s -> 4801.80s]  I did we had printing stuff and they're they're making them. They're they're producing them
[4801.88s -> 4804.44s]  But we these are just samples of the boxes and some of the cards
[4805.14s -> 4811.78s]  So there are two full decks that will be sitting in these little wells and then everything will sit on top
[4811.86s -> 4823.54s]  Actually, i'll show you what it might look like when you open it probably a good idea hold everything back up
[4828.40s -> 4831.75s]  There are duplicates. Yes, there are the game
[4832.55s -> 4836.23s]  So besides this being channel merch because that's what this is
[4837.25s -> 4843.25s]  We wanted a good functioning game on top of it because why not like i've got originally this was going to be baseball cards
[4844.15s -> 4848.72s]  In quotes, so this was originally just going to be no game
[4849.60s -> 4851.92s]  We got in touch with the game designer and it was like why not let's go
[4852.74s -> 4855.36s]  Why not just have something fun on top of it, too?
[4855.36s -> 4857.70s]  so there are
[4857.70s -> 4863.78s]  You can have duplicates in a deck and it's the game the game wise it makes sense because I think you can have up to three
[4864.18s -> 4870.24s]  Cards, right up to three the same card. I gotta fold this up. Nice. I don't want to mess it up
[4873.54s -> 4880.58s]  So in the starter deck there are duplicates because they are pre-built decks for you to just be able to play it or just collect it
[4880.82s -> 4894.85s]  So the decks in there are pre-built. I gotta fold this. I'm so paranoid. I'm gonna rip it because I don't want to let
[4895.72s -> 4903.67s]  This is my special sample copy. I don't want to mess it up. They're pretty sturdy though because it feels like it
[4903.91s -> 4915.44s]  There we go. What do they smell like? I don't know nothing. Uh that moon by the way
[4916.64s -> 4918.40s]  That moon card comes in the starter kit
[4918.40s -> 4921.08s]  So that's good to know if you want that card
[4921.24s -> 4925.48s]  It's in the starter kit my card the germa card is also in the starter kit as well
[4928.79s -> 4934.16s]  Would you like to see how far we've come?
[4934.16s -> 4943.88s]  This is from the stream. Do you remember this? Yeah, these are these are from the these are from the stream
[4944.20s -> 4949.56s]  Do you remember the stream? These are not I would say these are not bad
[4949.96s -> 4954.85s]  You know, they're a little the cut is a little we did this happened by
[4955.41s -> 4961.56s]  Yeah, archaeologist don't bend it. I'm not I just want to show you the difference. I want to show you the difference
[4965.64s -> 4972.48s]  I'm not bending them that hard. Yeah, two different pre-built decks two different decks. You don't get two of the same one
[4972.48s -> 4984.20s]  It's two different pre-built decks. There you go. You want to see the difference might as well show the difference, right?
[4987.96s -> 4992.69s]  So the one on the left is the original the one on the right is the new the new one
[4993.01s -> 4998.15s]  The new card I guess you could say the new what it looks like actually that better idea to show it like this
[4998.55s -> 5006.82s]  Did you get a good idea of what like the first original on the stream looked like there we go
[5007.14s -> 5023.43s]  So this one on the left is the the ones we're printing one of the right is the original and again printed and made in america
[5023.67s -> 5040.60s]  I want to make that point clear in the united states of america. Oh, I dropped them my precious my precious samples
[5044.21s -> 5050.29s]  So between the two starter decks that you get there are I believe there are 40 unique cards
[5051.01s -> 5056.53s]  Because they're doubles they have to have doubles for the game sense, right? There's 84 cards total in each
[5057.25s -> 5063.00s]  Across the two starter decks. So there you go. I
[5065.36s -> 5066.88s]  More than 40 unique cards. Sorry
[5066.88s -> 5070.15s]  I'm just i'm looking I gotta get corrected by the ground abuse group chat
[5071.80s -> 5079.01s]  And then you get the two boosters in there too, which is another 20 cards. There you go. Pick them up
[5079.09s -> 5092.72s]  I they've they've fallen in a perfect position pinned tweet pinned tweet. Thank you for the demonstration. Mr
[5092.72s -> 5103.43s]  Jeremy will this be on the test if it's more than it was more than a it's more than a four. It's on the test
[5107.48s -> 5125.08s]  Thanks our grotto beast nfts. No, what's up saying that look I like this this it's cool
[5126.31s -> 5129.19s]  All right. There you go. I want to show it now you see kind of what's in the box
[5129.27s -> 5136.66s]  Unfortunately, the two pre-built starter decks are not there as well as any of the cards that obviously because we don't have that
[5136.66s -> 5143.22s]  I don't have them here. There you go. Are there any questions before we move on?
[5143.38s -> 5145.38s]  I want to make sure we answer most of the stuff right now
[5154.77s -> 5161.04s]  Why did I how am I going to answer any of these when are they shipping?
[5161.78s -> 5163.38s]  All right grotto beast group chat
[5163.38s -> 5167.14s]  Give me a hand here because we're having a pre-sale go for the next probably two weeks
[5168.04s -> 5174.20s]  After the pre-sale ends the inventory that we've already have in production right now will be part of the first things to ship out
[5175.78s -> 5179.38s]  Again, if you are buying boosters right now
[5180.16s -> 5186.95s]  You are claiming the second run of production because the first run of production has already been claimed
[5192.40s -> 5196.68s]  How many total unique cards are there 200?
[5197.59s -> 5210.42s]  There are 200 unique cards. Is it feasibly possible to collect everything?
[5211.38s -> 5215.72s]  That is a good question. I think the purpose with this was
[5216.28s -> 5218.64s]  to be interesting merch and
[5219.04s -> 5222.64s]  We don't really have a plan as of right now and what we're going to do in the future with this
[5223.70s -> 5235.84s]  So I don't know. I guess maybe I it's a great question because it's a limited run as well. What's the calorie count?
[5239.52s -> 5242.64s]  Yes, the pre-sale is going to ship out shortly after the pre-sale ends
[5243.04s -> 5246.64s]  So in a couple of weeks just check back every so often
[5246.72s -> 5252.92s]  Well, i'm guys i'm going to be talking about this every five or six days until every like but that's way too long
[5253.24s -> 5256.18s]  I'll be talking about this every day or two on stream
[5256.82s -> 5261.54s]  Until the pre-sale is over again. The point of the pre-sale is even though we've gone through
[5262.44s -> 5264.61s]  our production inventory
[5265.09s -> 5270.90s]  Of boosters. I didn't want it to say well, it's sold out and that's it
[5271.60s -> 5275.44s]  And sorry, but we went through our inventory and that's it. We have to contact the printer
[5276.98s -> 5282.60s]  Reprint do a second run but keep the pre-sale open so you can still claim it at the price
[5282.60s -> 5289.01s]  We are showing you if we didn't if it was just that one run and we didn't kind of keep this pre-sale going
[5289.57s -> 5292.12s]  Then two or three weeks from now
[5292.12s -> 5294.12s]  I don't want these to appear for you know
[5294.20s -> 5298.82s]  The price that we a price that we are not telling you to pay weeks down the road
[5299.46s -> 5304.58s]  We want whoever wants this over the coming two or three weeks to be able to claim
[5304.98s -> 5312.40s]  Product for the price that we are telling you so over these two and a half weeks or so
[5314.15s -> 5318.47s]  We're keeping a pre-sale going regardless if we run out of production inventory
[5318.71s -> 5328.21s]  How long is a pre-sale at least for at least 10 to 14 more days at least there you go
[5328.45s -> 5342.77s]  Will you play it on stream? You will absolutely see this be shown on stream. I can't say i'm very good
[5342.77s -> 5345.11s]  Good
[5345.11s -> 5347.11s]  It's very it's fun though. It's very fun
[5354.69s -> 5359.01s]  and then another couple weeks we'll have maybe something else to talk about and
[5360.05s -> 5364.56s]  Show you but from now, we're really happy
[5364.56s -> 5368.66s]  It seems like people are into it and that was a big fear is is
[5368.90s -> 5372.10s]  Are people and all the production costs and everything is this like people?
[5372.58s -> 5379.03s]  Kind of actually care about this and the answer apparently is yes. So thanks everybody
[5379.81s -> 5384.29s]  We're all you you cannot understand the the excitement going on over here everyone. That's just
[5384.77s -> 5389.57s]  So happy with the reception and we hope you like it. We hope you think it's a good enough quality
[5389.57s -> 5391.88s]  we really hope you do and
[5392.66s -> 5404.90s]  It's it's merch. It's channel merch and that's pretty much the way that it is. It's very
[5405.62s -> 5417.35s]  Different channel merch, but it is merch nonetheless and any plans on this project going forward. We don't have
[5418.16s -> 5421.84s]  There's no plans right now. We don't want to talk about any plans
[5422.40s -> 5428.39s]  Because we need to see how this goes this is uncharted territory for everybody over here
[5428.87s -> 5441.75s]  So we're trying trying we're trying to figure it out. This guy sucks at grotto beasts
[5446.79s -> 5450.71s]  What happened to the pin tweet? I deleted it because I need to make room for another one
[5459.36s -> 5462.12s]  I hope it makes it big
[5462.12s -> 5464.92s]  Well, and again, I that's fucking cool
[5465.64s -> 5471.73s]  That's really really cool. I I can't even believe that that's something that somebody would even utter but remember
[5472.37s -> 5478.82s]  It's fun channel merch first and foremost. We made this for you guys. We made this for this community
[5479.76s -> 5483.68s]  That was the intent that was the purpose and whatever people do with it
[5483.68s -> 5492.64s]  Whatever people think whatever how much fun people have with it. Cool. That's awesome. That makes all of us happy and we'll see
[5493.04s -> 5502.50s]  Let's go back to hylix. Although
[5503.28s -> 5505.12s]  I got i'm gonna i gotta pee
[5505.12s -> 5840.71s]  I'll be right back. I'm gonna go pee. Okay
[5841.43s -> 5843.27s]  I am back
[5843.27s -> 5847.11s]  Sorry, I was gone for a little bit. I wanted to refill my little drink I have here
[5847.99s -> 5849.94s]  I also wanted to
[5849.94s -> 5858.42s]  Just kind of corroborate with the grotto beast team make sure everything I said was accurate. Cool. Oh, there's no music. I'm sorry
[5858.82s -> 5865.91s]  Should have been this
[5865.91s -> 5867.51s]  Well, I did pee
[5867.51s -> 5873.24s]  I peed and then I was like, hey, let's ask a couple of questions to make sure I got this right
[5873.80s -> 5885.81s]  Okie dokie. Let's play
[5886.05s -> 5896.82s]  Hylix so what's the last thing we just did right? Okay. I came here. I did this
[5897.30s -> 5905.67s]  I'm gonna go to that place where I was before down here. Oh, I don't need to go in this
[5905.99s -> 5918.07s]  Don't you dare tell me that I need to relax. Well, i'm saying what I
[5918.63s -> 5925.22s]  I'm relaxing right now. Okay
[5927.27s -> 5938.77s]  I think I could fight these things now. Can I I should be strong enough? I'm doing it. Oh shit
[5938.77s -> 5956.58s]  I forgot to sleep vibe check. I think the vibes are pretty great. Uh, I need to heal
[5967.30s -> 6004.72s]  That hurt two damage don't do it. No, I think i'm all right. Jesus this hurts. Oh
[6005.52s -> 6018.05s]  I could revive but no, I only have one of those shit
[6019.06s -> 6032.44s]  Kind of in trouble
[6032.44s -> 6039.75s]  deal
[6039.75s -> 6058.56s]  I think i'll survive. Yeah, i'm all right. These things hurt the sauce still says you're in the bathroom
[6060.36s -> 6064.52s]  Well, the stream is live right now if that's for only when the stream is offline
[6073.84s -> 6090.47s]  600 bucks damn. Okay. Hold on. This is we need to heal. Wait, he's just dead. Oh
[6091.59s -> 6107.48s]  I have to use the burrito. All right
[6116.90s -> 6119.57s]  What the fuck are you guys doing over here?
[6119.81s -> 6128.55s]  I'm not gonna even i'm not i'm not gonna show that because it's stupid
[6135.33s -> 6141.25s]  No, if you i'm no i'm not even gonna address it it's it's a stupid meme that somebody did in the discord
[6141.49s -> 6156.10s]  I'm not doing that. I can't i'm playing a game right now. I can't show it tv
[6156.42s -> 6169.67s]  I don't even understand what this meme is
[6169.67s -> 6175.92s]  What is this meme trying to what is this meme? Can somebody explain this to me? I don't get it
[6176.00s -> 6178.80s]  I mean I get it what they're doing, but I don't get it at the same time
[6181.80s -> 6187.46s]  Bernie watching a video of me with cigarette packs smoking a cigarette. I don't get it
[6187.54s -> 6192.48s]  I don't understand this and i'm not showing it. I'm just not gonna show it. I don't get it
[6201.64s -> 6234.53s]  I don't get what does this mean? Fine. I'll show it. What is this supposed to be? I I don't get it
[6240.87s -> 6252.04s]  I understand this
[6252.04s -> 6270.52s]  Does anybody get it?
[6271.70s -> 6276.52s]  All right. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose here. I gotta pay attention. I activated that crystal, right?
[6276.60s -> 6288.10s]  Yeah, I don't think there's anything to get necessarily. I I don't get it. I I I don't get it
[6288.10s -> 6312.16s]  I don't get this. I don't get this. We're gonna kill one real quick right now. You're not gonna die again, right?
[6312.48s -> 6332.53s]  You know, you're gonna die again. What he's a full health. Why'd he die so quickly bro? You suck
[6332.77s -> 6339.01s]  No, I I gotta pay attention people are sending me bernie sanders like smoking memes of me holding cigarette packs
[6339.33s -> 6341.33s]  I'm a little distracted right now
[6350.96s -> 6363.17s]  No, no, it's fine. I am kind of in trouble though
[6363.49s -> 6371.06s]  I think I have to die because then I can put them turn the meat in right? Let's maybe that's not a bad thing
[6375.54s -> 6392.37s]  Parasite crystal. Whoa, i'm the sage of computers. I grant you my token sage's token. Okay, there's one more token
[6392.77s -> 6404.12s]  What about this?
[6404.12s -> 6410.10s]  Cool. Okay, so I have this token. I am terrified of this thing
[6410.50s -> 6441.91s]  I don't have a revive check the right side and then i'll probably leave that's the only way
[6442.23s -> 6452.34s]  I don't want to fight this thing. Oh shit
[6454.00s -> 6472.02s]  What no, I thought I dodged it. All right, i'll be all right just die. It's fine
[6472.58s -> 6474.82s]  But I want to be able to get all the secrets
[6483.76s -> 6485.76s]  Germa i'm crunk right now. I think you're cool
[6487.68s -> 6496.79s]  I appreciate it. Thanks stunned can't do anything
[6510.92s -> 6512.92s]  No, I thought I was gonna be dead
[6514.76s -> 6530.80s]  Are you scrunk
[6530.80s -> 6538.61s]  No
[6538.61s -> 6541.65s]  They explained to the bernie meme in the discord. Oh, okay
[6542.21s -> 6548.74s]  What's the last time you played with playdoh?
[6549.14s -> 6551.08s]  That would have to be
[6551.08s -> 6552.68s]  at least
[6552.68s -> 6554.44s]  25 years ago
[6554.44s -> 6570.36s]  Dynamite wait, this is safe. No, you lied to me. You lied to me
[6570.76s -> 6576.95s]  I'm actually I feel betrayed right now. You lied to me. You said red line and that was a you lied to me
[6579.51s -> 6582.23s]  Oh
[6582.23s -> 6587.41s]  I'm definitely dead
[6587.41s -> 6603.59s]  Oh shit going no way. Goodbye. I do have a ton of meat though. All right, I gotta come back here
[6613.26s -> 6638.29s]  22 meat your max flesh rose, but okay 44 extra health is huge. It's so cool and freaky. It is cool
[6638.53s -> 6648.72s]  It is cool and freaky the executive balcony is down the stairs only those who have died three times are allowed there
[6649.57s -> 6652.69s]  Uh, I guess you qualify good job. You may proceed
[6655.20s -> 6667.06s]  Nice job swish swish axe found. Ooh
[6668.47s -> 6683.00s]  Time steals away like a stream. We glide hence away. I need a paper cup. That's extra mana who can use that
[6683.32s -> 6696.74s]  Okay, so this is a ton of damage but no nothing on it greatly increases maximum will points
[6697.30s -> 6702.92s]  Oh, I don't think I want that right now, but I definitely will take this
[6717.52s -> 6727.84s]  Maybe I should be like castor in a way how much more that's a lot. That's an unbelievable amount
[6730.90s -> 6741.70s]  Yeah, I think i'll keep it on well if I get a paper cup
[6741.70s -> 6756.74s]  I gotta remember where that is, but let me sleep on the cup. There we go
[6756.90s -> 6765.67s]  All right. So it was what color was the one where it just was red or is it green? I don't remember. What was it?
[6767.60s -> 6798.66s]  Is green right? Yeah. All right much stronger now and I think we have to fight this I think we do panorama
[6800.96s -> 6833.46s]  45 damage that's a lot hit all of them. That's good. Yeah, i'm gonna use uh, stay dust as a caster killer poison
[6833.78s -> 6848.96s]  I think that the one in the middle will die. I'm poisoned right get that connor attack out of here
[6849.60s -> 6862.90s]  James freaking me out dude. Take a quick break another paper cup
[6863.65s -> 6876.44s]  Take a quick break and come back or not, you know, maybe get some food in you too muscle
[6877.27s -> 6893.83s]  All right, i'm afraid but i'm gonna do it you you inadvertently destroyed it what what just happened those things kill you instantly
[6894.15s -> 6913.08s]  Holy shit. Okay. Well, let's try it again. Did I get everything that was down there?
[6913.40s -> 6930.37s]  You ignored the sign at the beginning. Oh, those are the skulls. Well, I didn't well
[6930.45s -> 6932.63s]  I don't know what it meant by that
[6932.63s -> 6937.27s]  Everything this game is so wacky looking. I didn't know that. I don't know. I don't know what that thing was
[6937.67s -> 6968.72s]  300 bucks nice. All right. Well, I got everything here. I got everything here. So where have I not gone?
[6971.40s -> 6976.71s]  I guess I could walk around out here. Have I explored all this area yet?
[6976.95s -> 7000.21s]  No, there was that big that like big vault. I wonder if i'm strong enough orange
[7000.45s -> 7022.26s]  Which I would orange or blue blue I think right i'm pretty sure it's blue and then from blue
[7022.82s -> 7034.40s]  Was he up or was he I don't remember where he was. What was that guy the vegetables?
[7034.80s -> 7048.52s]  Oh, yes vegetables vegetables vegetables part two is even better. I mean, this is great
[7076.10s -> 7082.64s]  All right, where was that guy? It was green crystal and then from green
[7083.04s -> 7098.05s]  I just kind of don't remember where he was. Where do I go over there? Where do I go?
[7102.00s -> 7104.87s]  It's green. Where do I go?
[7105.27s -> 7126.71s]  Teleporter in the skull maze. Well, I would need to die right just go to green die and go to green
[7126.87s -> 7136.16s]  It's in the middle
[7136.16s -> 7152.05s]  Uh, okay go to the warp station. I think I don't have to be dead to be at the warp station
[7152.29s -> 7161.24s]  I thought that's the afterlife. Isn't it? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. You're right
[7161.24s -> 7194.29s]  You're right. Yep forgot about this. So you think i'm strong enough to fight this thing find out maybe I mean
[7194.29s -> 7233.01s]  This is a lot. Let's try it. I can't like go around or anything, right? Can I sneak in? All right, i'll fight him
[7233.33s -> 7248.64s]  I wonder what the strategy here is take out the ads first. Yeah, and then let's do a panorama
[7249.20s -> 7268.23s]  All right, that hurts a lot
[7268.23s -> 7269.11s]  shit
[7269.11s -> 7279.84s]  There you go. Just don't die
[7291.43s -> 7292.31s]  Nope
[7292.31s -> 7304.26s]  I think we're okay
[7304.26s -> 7305.38s]  Jesus
[7305.38s -> 7312.29s]  Oh, that's all that's self only
[7313.62s -> 7315.78s]  Oh, I thought that was okay. I'll just heal
[7319.86s -> 7325.12s]  Uh-oh
[7325.12s -> 7342.16s]  Oh, thank god one health. Damn. Okay
[7342.96s -> 7359.28s]  The one on the right has been confused almost the whole time. I think we're good
[7359.52s -> 7375.75s]  That's not gonna cause a problem, right if I don't kill the ads first
[7376.55s -> 7378.95s]  Oh, all right. Let's do it. There's a lot of money back there
[7379.51s -> 7389.96s]  22 damage. That's it
[7389.96s -> 7405.68s]  good again
[7405.68s -> 7412.31s]  Dps race. I did it only 75 bucks
[7412.87s -> 7423.86s]  I kind of feel bad
[7423.86s -> 7428.18s]  Artificial bicep was found 50 bucks
[7430.84s -> 7462.12s]  That's it 100 bucks and that's it. Well, there's a tv in here detonation artificial bicep increases
[7462.52s -> 7478.72s]  HP and strength. What was that new power detonation inflicts 250 percent damage
[7479.36s -> 7481.80s]  Slow casting speed
[7481.80s -> 7491.24s]  Can you do that too? Jesus thermostreams in 864p because maximum bitrate allowed by twitch is 6 000
[7491.32s -> 7493.56s]  1080p 60 is too large for that barrier to look good
[7494.82s -> 7501.17s]  Well, you can make 1080 1080 6 uh, 1080 30. This is fine. 1080 60 is okay, too
[7501.57s -> 7512.36s]  It's I prefer it the other way. Why did I read that? I don't know. Why are you reading the
[7512.84s -> 7514.84s]  You're reading the bot messages. I don't
[7515.32s -> 7517.32s]  I don't know. I looked over and I saw it
[7517.88s -> 7521.16s]  I saw somebody do that emote where i'm like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[7521.16s -> 7528.34s]  I thought they would I thought they were talking shit. So it was that's an official message. Oops. That's my bad
[7540.55s -> 7550.29s]  All right. That's good. Let's go this way. What what?
[7552.44s -> 7556.76s]  Why why is there uproarous laughter right now? I'm missing something
[7558.64s -> 7585.80s]  What's happening? Visitors are rare. It's hot. Ow. Oh, don't touch it. This dude is beefing with his own nightbot

[13550.27s -> 13559.87s]  You're not allowed to enter the lab without claw man's permission
[13559.87s -> 13583.04s]  It would look to be claw man if I were to guess nice to finally meet you if you'll just give me the password

[13602.00s -> 13613.12s]  They keep saying that i'm gonna say pneumatic art. Not that either. Stop joking around. This is your final chance
[13613.36s -> 13616.37s]  I mean, they're all these are all random
[13618.36s -> 13629.22s]  Insect who are you prepare to be destroyed? Okay and begin

[13723.65s -> 13731.20s]  Shit. Oh my god. It's bad
[13732.08s -> 13734.08s]  This thing is destructive
[13734.62s -> 13737.41s]  destructive
[13737.41s -> 13739.81s]  Uh, I I don't think I was prepared for this
[13740.61s -> 13752.00s]  What is the speed on this guy?
[13761.20s -> 13762.48s]  Yes
[13762.48s -> 13763.52s]  Yes
[13763.52s -> 13765.52s]  Obviously, I went for it. I just went for it
[13768.54s -> 13777.36s]  10 000 bucks. I I went for it. Hell. Yeah
[13785.15s -> 13787.79s]  Uh, I don't want to revive yet because I might be able to bring them back
[13788.59s -> 13794.35s]  Beside his microcosm
[13794.43s -> 13797.12s]  Avenge beside it
[13797.12s -> 13798.80s]  All right. I I got permission
[13798.80s -> 13819.02s]  It's the lab these enemies. You must be the new guy the machines have been prepared. So feel free to give them a whirl
[13819.66s -> 13834.56s]  I'll never get tired of watching the machine do its thing. I selected these specimens for their exceptionally high monetization potential
[13835.04s -> 13861.60s]  Let's smear spirit rapidly press all the buttons. I made money
[13866.43s -> 13867.71s]  250
[13867.71s -> 13873.63s]  Thousand dollars. What do I do with that money? What am I supposed to do with that?
[13878.06s -> 13906.05s]  Uh a half a million. I have seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars now now what does it go?
[13906.69s -> 13926.94s]  Buy every single thing in the store. That's all I can do here. I think that's it. Yeah, that's it
[13928.30s -> 13930.96s]  Seven hundred and seventy four thousand dollars. Holy shit
[13932.16s -> 13975.87s]  Okay. Well, whoo. I'm buying everything if it's in the store. I own it. Okay, the last token
[13976.19s -> 13990.93s]  Where's the last token? Maybe the place I haven't been yet. Actually, now I want to go to the other stores
[14009.09s -> 14014.58s]  Frito token is in that statue maze
[14015.62s -> 14016.66s]  Ah

[14046.22s -> 14066.62s]  Roam bowler. I just get like two of them. I have so much money berry shield cooking greatly increases maximum health points
[14066.62s -> 14068.62s]  I wonder if I should give that to you
[14081.82s -> 14095.42s]  336
[14095.42s -> 14097.42s]  364 that's a lot actually
[14102.02s -> 14105.54s]  I'd rather them stay alive. Yeah, i'm gonna let them have it
[14105.78s -> 14113.38s]  Okay
[14113.38s -> 14122.58s]  I'm gonna go to the statue place because I want to see I want to see what happens. Don't use all the money
[14123.34s -> 14151.28s]  Um, I got seven hundred thousand dollars. All right back outside looking good. Let's go. It was over here
[14152.24s -> 14164.35s]  So i'm gonna say down and to the left. I did not go this way
[14166.13s -> 14186.40s]  Oh, there's nothing over there to the right should I go? Yeah, that's right trash can maybe oh shit bad
[14186.72s -> 14211.73s]  Okay paper cup. Where is it? Where is it? I'll probably I
[14214.03s -> 14217.79s]  Restart I might need to restart it
[14220.00s -> 14248.30s]  I think I have to restart it. I'm dead. Whatever. Which one of these is it red one, right?
[14248.54s -> 14283.20s]  Oh like the like the very red one. Yeah, very red one. So where is it? Oh my god

[14319.76s -> 14323.12s]  How did you do that? You were stuck all the way to the right, dude
[14323.52s -> 14352.82s]  How did you do? How did you do that? Shit? I'm just trying to bait him out of here. Oh, come on
[14353.22s -> 14360.67s]  No, I need to soak my right hand in warm water
[14375.70s -> 14391.17s]  Don't because my hand is sore. All right, all three of you come down this way

[14451.49s -> 14460.18s]  Thanks
[14463.60s -> 14469.04s]  You just kill me because I want to summon the um plane
[14473.36s -> 14479.23s]  The best place to summon the plane
[14479.23s -> 14501.36s]  Wait green these don't hurt me anymore. Can I do anything else on the right side? I can do here, right?
[14510.42s -> 14511.94s]  25 points
[14511.94s -> 14546.94s]  I don't think I can do anything else here, but they don't hurt me. So this was on that
[14547.26s -> 14559.94s]  Should I do this now? Why can I summon the airship should I do this later or do this now?
[14562.85s -> 14564.29s]  It's not going to end the game or anything, right?
[14564.29s -> 14576.13s]  Because there's this one spot up here that I have not been to go use the tokens now
[14585.36s -> 14601.10s]  I have to use the boat. Let's see you play the sequel 100. Yes
[14601.74s -> 14613.95s]  This has been a really enjoyable experience. I think it's great. I will 100 play the sequel. Okay
[14614.59s -> 14628.82s]  All the tokens are there as the tv say learned legend of melting the ultimate magic
[14637.98s -> 14641.74s]  Ultimate magic randomly strikes three times may briefly stun
[14642.92s -> 14647.20s]  200 mp the only one that can cast this is you
[14652.43s -> 14667.22s]  Damn sponsored stream. Why the hell would this be a sponsored stream? This game came out like fucking six years ago
[14671.38s -> 14676.40s]  What when did this game come out like 2000 fucking 16?
[14677.72s -> 14680.77s]  2013 how long is this game been out for?
[14681.71s -> 14691.28s]  It was eight years ago. That would be crazy
[14691.84s -> 14719.70s]  I'm ready
[14719.70s -> 14729.30s]  Whatever. This is we're seeing it. You got the sponsorship eight years ago and they were just really lenient on the time frame
[14730.50s -> 14738.06s]  Oh my god, that would be fucking awful. Yeah, I mean back when I was in the middle making youtube videos
[14738.46s -> 14744.75s]  Yeah, I just didn't have a time frame on it. It just said at some point in the future and I was like, yeah sure
[14749.90s -> 14758.88s]  Always read your contracts. That's what I will tell you. There was no time frame. That would be so fucked up
[14760.00s -> 14764.93s]  But no, this game's just really cool and we're doing just hanging out. We're just chilling
[14765.25s -> 14771.22s]  That's it. Can I introduce you in a hot dogs or perhaps a spaceship key? Yes
[14773.68s -> 14795.70s]  Uh, i'll take that. I gotta look at my money. I'm fucking loaded. I could buy two if I wanted. Oh shit
[14795.94s -> 14801.87s]  Um, I want to try this. I want to try the super attack. I'm gonna try the legend of melting. Let's see what it does
[14802.35s -> 14819.41s]  Okay
[14819.41s -> 14829.07s]  legend of melting
[14829.07s -> 14840.96s]  All right
[14840.96s -> 14851.50s]  Cool. This is the spaceship then spaceship is the end game. Uh
[14852.30s -> 14856.62s]  I think I think I did pretty much anything everything I could have done
[14856.62s -> 14861.28s]  Maybe there's probably some secrets I didn't see but I think I saw mostly everything
[14862.53s -> 14869.25s]  Yeah, I think I did everything. I've been to every island. I went to everything in the underground. Yeah, I did it all
[14869.33s -> 14896.34s]  Okay, let's turn the spaceship on. I'm just gonna buy an absolute shitload of hot dogs
[14896.58s -> 14910.10s]  Do I need six hundred thousand dollars? I'm just gonna buy a thousand of these and buy fifty of them
[14910.26s -> 14921.38s]  We'll buy juice in the city. Where do you buy juice? I didn't find a place to buy it
[14927.62s -> 14935.55s]  Was there a place in the city to buy juice? I didn't see it. Juice is only from kills
[14935.71s -> 14946.66s]  I think i'll be all right. I'm gonna buy like 10 of these or like 20. I got six hundred thousand dollars
[14946.74s -> 14998.69s]  Yeah, let's go. Let's do it. I'm ready. I haven't saved right before this so oh anything else wait
[14998.69s -> 15015.07s]  What about this little thing? Can I go this way? Have you ever tried cruelty squad? I have not seen cruelty squad
[15015.39s -> 15021.98s]  I'm not well, i've seen it, but i've not played it. I feel like that the game I know is awesome
[15022.30s -> 15027.30s]  I've been I've been told it's fucking awesome, but it looks a little harsh
[15027.62s -> 15033.36s]  Looks like my brain would probably get hurt like I would be like, uh, it would probably give me a headache
[15034.38s -> 15044.35s]  Let me ask you a question if I can handle this could I handle cruelty squad? I heard it's awesome
[15044.75s -> 15051.52s]  But yeah, you think so it gave me a headache gave me a headache
[15052.08s -> 15056.98s]  maybe you know what i'll do maybe i'll jump into it for like 20 minutes or so off stream to see how I feel because I
[15057.81s -> 15062.77s]  Believe it or not. I do have like audio visual stimulation that sometimes it can actually give me a headache
[15064.16s -> 15066.80s]  Sometimes dude, I tell you when I in the half-life 2 bolt level
[15066.88s -> 15069.76s]  I almost puked and I had to lie down on my floor for like 10 minutes in between
[15071.07s -> 15078.72s]  Bits of that game. I remember lying on my back on the floor should not throw up playing half-life 2
[15078.88s -> 15095.09s]  What's going on here? Do I have to fight all these? Entering the palace is forbidden leave now or be destroyed
[15095.41s -> 15098.42s]  You accidentally crushed it. Oh
[15100.67s -> 15110.40s]  Simmery axe inflicts
[15111.28s -> 15113.28s]  Electrobiological damage
[15115.65s -> 15124.22s]  I mean that's kind of all right. I can give this back to you. See this should go to sams nasa
[15126.67s -> 15128.67s]  Isn't it? Wait, why can't you use that?
[15131.25s -> 15163.07s]  It smells I can't use it interesting. Whoa. Okay. We're just wiping everybody out another tv
[15166.43s -> 15169.07s]  Exhaled he thrums despite refugent concavity
[15170.10s -> 15170.90s]  Oh

[15200.91s -> 15208.50s]  Boy, is there any other items in this room that i'm not seeing?

[15238.59s -> 15242.88s]  Boy turn back. It's terribly powerful
[15246.66s -> 15249.28s]  Rehydrate out of blatantly mild

[15346.45s -> 15348.00s]  special
[15348.00s -> 15350.56s]  Health chant. Yep. Just good to get it out of the way
[15352.00s -> 15366.26s]  Attack attack maybe kill thing on the right first. Is that anything healing? Jesus
[15372.19s -> 15385.49s]  Heal 196. Mm
[15394.96s -> 15408.10s]  I didn't mean to do that, but it's okay. I think i'm fine melting melting is 292
[15408.42s -> 15428.10s]  I didn't mean to do that, but it's fine ancient odor. No poison though. There it is. All right, that's dead

[15523.58s -> 15524.54s]  I didn't know he was stunned
[15524.54s -> 15527.42s]  I tried to have him do three moves in a row and I was like, why is he not doing anything?
[15527.58s -> 15535.66s]  All right, we lose. Thank god, dude. It's my speed zero. I can't even attack
[15536.14s -> 15545.70s]  Okay, this dude does four moves before I can do one piece of shit

[16353.15s -> 16359.74s]  But a lot of people have been uh requesting I play this for a while and we'll definitely play the second one, too
[16363.57s -> 16368.83s]  That's a steal. Yeah, I mean like that's

[16416.70s -> 16420.78s]  Oh four hours. Okay. I was like what that's not correct
[16427.31s -> 16431.44s]  Yeah, I I don't I can't give this game a rating. I don't think it
[16431.76s -> 16443.54s]  I don't think I want to I think I would just say this is a recommended experience because to me
[16446.88s -> 16448.88s]  It was it was a great time
[16448.96s -> 16454.62s]  But I don't think that the experience that I had here I could be like well, let me say uh x out of 10
[16455.38s -> 16457.38s]  No, no, it was just great. It was just really cool
[16463.42s -> 16467.66s]  But like I gave you okay if you want it to be rated if this has to be a rating for you

[16484.88s -> 16490.93s]  I don't think you can I think it's just a good plus which means that was fucking fun. That was great
[16491.17s -> 16504.03s]  This game was in a museum as a demo
[16506.24s -> 16510.80s]  Yeah, this game was to me was like more of like a an art journey and like an experience
