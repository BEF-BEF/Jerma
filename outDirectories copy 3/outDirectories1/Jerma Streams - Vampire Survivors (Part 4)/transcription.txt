[4.66s -> 15.98s]  Hey, what's up? I don't... am I half hour late? Yep, a few things I had to take care of.
[16.70s -> 27.14s]  A few things I had to do. A few things I had to take care of. But the one good thing is, uh,
[28.65s -> 33.42s]  not four. I wanted to make sure I started at least an hour or two early today to avoid
[34.22s -> 43.21s]  any problems with the internet. I had a, uh, naked on stream dream again last night,
[46.66s -> 50.82s]  and, uh, this one was... I don't... I'm sorry, I don't remember the whole thing.
[52.12s -> 59.29s]  I just remember being turned, and the camera was pointed down. I just remember it was... the camera
[59.29s -> 66.14s]  was down, and it was like a full-body cam. Where the camera is, in the same spot it is now,
[67.26s -> 74.14s]  just slightly tilted down, and I was turned naked, and like, I mean, actually naked.
[76.07s -> 82.41s]  And I don't know, my leg was turned up so you couldn't see my... I don't know.
[83.64s -> 88.92s]  But like, I thought maybe you could. I don't know why I was on... look, I don't know why I keep
[88.92s -> 100.50s]  having this dream. I keep having this dream. I think it's because my brain is telling me,
[101.78s -> 107.94s]  dude, one day, one day it's gonna happen. You're gonna be naked on camera. Just, just like this.
[108.74s -> 115.21s]  Just like this. I'm like, no, no, I don't want to. I don't want to be naked on camera. My brain is
[115.21s -> 127.16s]  like, I don't know, my brain's essentially just preparing me. Retirement stream. Dude, just face
[127.16s -> 134.06s]  your fears already. You know, I'm just gonna get it out of the way. I mean, my dreams keep... this
[134.06s -> 143.94s]  keeps happening in my dream, so I'm just gonna do it. Uh, anyways, welcome to today's stream.
[144.66s -> 152.06s]  We'll be live today. We'll also be live tomorrow. Should be a fun time. We've got a line up.
[152.62s -> 161.99s]  Quite the lineup today. Vampire Survivors is in 1.0. Check. Gotham Knights has released.
[162.63s -> 168.76s]  Sponsored. Check. And then we'll end it with Deadly Night, which I was incorrect.
[169.48s -> 174.92s]  That's not a puppet combo game. There is a new puppet combo game. We will play that.
[174.92s -> 179.54s]  Probably closer to Halloween. I want to make sure I correct the record from last night.
[180.10s -> 191.32s]  When is Breath of the Wild? Breath of the Wild will probably end up being...
[195.74s -> 205.53s]  Oh, tomorrow. We'll do Breath of the Wild tomorrow. Tomorrow will be a short stream,
[205.53s -> 211.34s]  though. We're not gonna go... I... this one will go at least six to seven hours, I'm imagining,
[211.34s -> 217.06s]  because we're playing three different games. But tomorrow we'll do maybe a couple of hours
[217.06s -> 230.17s]  of Breath of the Wild. Couple of hours of, you know, Gotham Knights. And then I love it. Let me...
[230.73s -> 235.93s]  I think people might want to make sure I clear this up, too. Like, the sponsored Gotham Knights
[235.93s -> 243.80s]  stuff is not as over after tomorrow. So it was essentially a mega weekend. What's my favorite
[243.80s -> 259.11s]  movie? There's quite a few. We play Overwatch on Sunday. Gremlins 2 is up, yeah, it's probably
[259.11s -> 268.15s]  number one. But there are quite a few movies that are in, like, the top five. I don't know if I'm
[268.15s -> 275.96s]  gonna play Overwatch. Overwatch is one of those games that I feel like you have to... you have to
[275.96s -> 281.72s]  play it... I don't just want to jump in and play Overwatch for an hour, because I'm gonna be
[281.72s -> 285.08s]  terrible, and I'm not gonna even know what any of the heroes fucking do. I'm not gonna know what the
[285.08s -> 290.84s]  maps are, and I'm gonna look like a total dickhead. And I'm gonna get frustrated, because I've spent
[290.84s -> 294.92s]  like 40 minutes total in the entire game, playing against people that have been playing probably
[294.92s -> 299.83s]  for like three weeks. And I'm just gonna be like, well, that was dumb. I'm not doing that ever again.
[300.47s -> 307.03s]  Overwatch is kind of game like all the other like multiplayer type games that are multiplayer
[307.03s -> 312.71s]  pretty much only, where you need to be playing it. Like you have to play these games in a semi
[312.71s -> 319.38s]  frequent kind of way. To be able to, oh yeah, I'm gonna play Overwatch today. But I guess that you
[319.38s -> 325.75s]  do have to start somewhere. But I'm telling you right now, if I play Overwatch one day,
[325.75s -> 330.95s]  I will not be playing Overwatch two, three, four, five, six days, 10 days, a month. It's just not
[330.95s -> 340.04s]  gonna happen. So weighing that, like what I would rather play Overwatch two, or something,
[340.04s -> 343.64s]  anything else in the bed, that's probably always going to be anything else, because I don't have
[343.64s -> 348.60s]  the time. I don't want to give the time to Overwatch two to get good enough at it where I can play it
[348.60s -> 359.80s]  and be like, yeah, this is great. cough cough cough cough. When are you gonna play Splatoon?
[360.82s -> 372.84s]  I don't know. There's a lot of games. When are you gonna play scorn? I even said it the way that I
[373.80s -> 379.21s]  It's in my brain forever now. Did you hear that? You heard that, right?
[384.97s -> 393.58s]  I was talking to Holly last night. And she said that as of right now, she's like, it's fucking me
[393.58s -> 399.42s]  up. Every time something happens, a major event plays out or a big puzzle is done and anything
[399.42s -> 406.90s]  she does or anything she sees, she just hears it in her head. Oh, the door is opening.
[407.62s -> 419.08s]  And here we are. Scorn. She says she hears it. What have I done? I'm sorry. You have scorned.
[419.08s -> 428.10s]  Well, you have to play it. I'll, I don't. All right. I, I think that I like that. It's, I think it's
[428.10s -> 434.02s]  really fun, but I don't want to ruin it. Because I feel like if it's too much, it will be ruined.
[435.13s -> 438.97s]  Right? You don't, I don't want to dilute the joke to a point where it's not funny anymore.
[439.53s -> 443.13s]  You have to be careful with these things. You guys have to be careful with these things.
[447.86s -> 454.94s]  Do it, ruin it. One right now is okay. No, because there's no reason to do it right now. All we,
[454.94s -> 458.62s]  okay. All we are going to do is I'm going to play the sound effect and I'm going to see Omega Lul
[458.62s -> 465.18s]  in like the background. You know what I mean? I'm just going to look over here and just see Omega
[465.18s -> 469.22s]  Lul is like just spammed in the background. Well, when I say background, I mean, because you're in,
[469.22s -> 477.19s]  you're on my monitor right now and I'll be able to see it in my peripheral. So I don't know. I,
[477.19s -> 483.99s]  why would, there's nothing, there's no reason to play it. We're just all going to go, oh yeah,
[485.11s -> 493.08s]  scored. And then slowly, very slowly, 10 people are going to go. There's no reason to do that.
[493.08s -> 497.00s]  That was like funny when you did it before, but it's not funny anymore. And then I'm going to take
[497.00s -> 503.56s]  a sip out of a drink and it's going to be scorn. And then 200 people are going to go as like, why
[503.56s -> 509.85s]  did you do that? Like that was kind of funny. The fifth time you did it. Be careful. It's a very
[509.85s -> 518.14s]  careful thing and I'm not going to ruin it. See, all of you thought I was going to do it right
[518.14s -> 528.42s]  there. Everybody did, but it's not happening. All right. You guys ready? Vampire survivors.
[532.15s -> 537.67s]  1.0 is out. I don't even know what I can unlock in this game right now. So yeah,
[537.67s -> 541.99s]  we'll play this for an hour or two. Gotham Knights for a couple hours and then boom,
[541.99s -> 545.19s]  deadly night to end it. I want to do it at night because I wanted to be scared. I wanted to be
[545.19s -> 554.63s]  scary. Okay. Here we go. You're a tactical comedian. I need to move this. This is going
[554.63s -> 566.98s]  to be in a better spot. There we go. Please stop teasing us. Stop. Okay. Um, what happened to my
[566.98s -> 578.44s]  screen? Who did that? Did you, did you do that? All right. I got my tea. I've got my phone. I've
[578.44s -> 590.09s]  got my stuff here. Uh, what am I missing? All right, let's go. Vampire survivors. 1.0. How are
[590.09s -> 595.45s]  you? I don't know. I watched the, some of the clips from yesterday and watched the stream and
[595.45s -> 600.09s]  stuff from yesterday. Dude, I just, I had just so much blood in my upper body. There's so much
[600.09s -> 607.45s]  blood in my, in my face and my hair. I'm very flush all the time. I just am. If you, okay,
[607.45s -> 613.90s]  if I was naked, I would have like a bright red purple face and then like just pale white.
[613.90s -> 618.06s]  I just have tons of blood. I think there's so much blood in my, in my brain. I think like,
[618.06s -> 625.45s]  it's just, I'm just constantly moving around here. I don't know. I always have like a bunch
[625.45s -> 630.25s]  of blood in my face, but it's not, I don't, I feel fine. You know what I mean? It's old. You're an
[630.25s -> 635.67s]  old man. Drink more water. I drink a shitload of water. Well, you know, I don't drink a shitload
[635.67s -> 645.64s]  of water. I drink enough water. It's due if you have too much niacin in your bloodstream.
[645.64s -> 653.69s]  No, what do you, how do you, what? The other guys have too much niacin. Okay, let's go like this.
[653.69s -> 662.55s]  Nope. Wrong thing. All right. So what do they add in 1.0? Is, is there a bunch of shit in 1.0
[662.55s -> 671.16s]  that they added? Why does it keep doing that? I don't like that. There we go. Can you guys hear
[671.16s -> 679.02s]  it? I can't hear it. Why? There we go. What do they add in 1.0? Looks like there's a lot of stuff
[679.02s -> 691.42s]  here. Move your cam to the left. They added a, all right. All right, let's do it. So I'm obviously,
[691.42s -> 700.71s]  let me see what the unlocks I have to do. Level 80 in the gallo tower. Okay. 15 minutes with
[700.71s -> 709.78s]  consetta and you get shadow pinion. I can do this. 15 minutes with consetta. Hide completed. Yeah,
[709.78s -> 714.78s]  let's do that. So what do you get? You get shadow pinion. All right, let's do this. 15 minutes. I
[714.78s -> 728.17s]  can do it. Wait, what does that character do? Do I even have that character? I don't even have that
[728.17s -> 742.14s]  character. How do I get that character? Oh no, yeah, I do. Gains 1% area every level. All right,
[742.14s -> 754.15s]  so area. I'm definitely doing damage. Super, a ton of huge area. Cool down projectiles or no?
[754.15s -> 762.23s]  I haven't played in a long time. I'm not sure what to do here. Is the best character? I just need to
[762.23s -> 771.05s]  survive 15 minutes. Speed, duration is just good. Movement speed is good. I think I have enough to
[771.05s -> 779.32s]  do pretty much everything. Do other projectiles because it's good to have. Greed, curse, I don't
[779.32s -> 791.53s]  want to do that. Reroll, skip, vanish. Get them all. Growth is good. Speed is good. You took a
[791.53s -> 797.72s]  shower? That's probably why I look. Yeah, I took a shower. This twitch integration now? Um, well,
[797.72s -> 804.74s]  I don't want to break anything yet. Let's do this first. Stop touching your nose. I am a, I am a
[804.74s -> 813.46s]  face toucher. I can't stop. I always do. Every two or three minutes I go, I just do it. I just do it.
[813.46s -> 821.34s]  Can I, I think I can do pretty much everything. Why am I even? I think, yeah, I can do like
[821.34s -> 828.33s]  everything. Why am I even deciding on choices here? Yeah, I can do almost every single item.
[828.33s -> 833.37s]  All right, cool. Let's do it. So it doesn't matter where I start, right? Just gotta survive for 15
[833.37s -> 844.86s]  minutes. Let's go for it. Uh, ooh, doesn't matter where, right? How about the library? Wait, what?
[844.86s -> 850.86s]  This one has a, where should I go? Do gallo for the quest. Oh, right. Okay. How long do I have to
[850.86s -> 861.96s]  live, uh, survive for? I don't, what is this shit? Hyper hurry arcana's. Should I do any of this? I
[861.96s -> 867.29s]  shouldn't do it. I don't, I'm just going to go. All right. What is this? What is this ability?
[867.29s -> 886.57s]  What is it going on? How do I, how do I, do I have to activate it? It's kind of loud. It's better.
[886.57s -> 898.81s]  It's a little loud. What is this thing? Um, ooh, okay. It's the area is bigger. So what whip for
[898.81s -> 910.58s]  area to change your direction sharply. Does the gun get gun is projectile, right? You have to stop
[910.58s -> 914.26s]  moving to activate it. Whip is, I would feel like the whip would be amazing here. I'm doing whip
[914.26s -> 928.01s]  because it's area. Oh, okay. I think I get it. Fires one more projectile. Uh, Ooh, I want this
[928.01s -> 940.30s]  song. A man is amazing. And remember it's area duplicator, more projectiles. I think so. Sorry.
[940.30s -> 951.53s]  How can I tell what direction it's going to go? Okay. It's whatever direction you start moving
[951.53s -> 969.21s]  when it spawns. I get it. Cool down. Um, yeah, one more of these. Let's go. It's pretty good.
[969.85s -> 977.98s]  It's kind of cool. It's the last direction of your input. Thank you so much for saying that
[977.98s -> 984.01s]  because I actually did not. I've actually been doing it wrong the whole time. Whip. Let's go.
[984.65s -> 1011.34s]  Oh, Oh God. Don't get stuck. I want to make it the project. Um, all right. What Matt,
[1011.34s -> 1026.38s]  none of these, um, match, right? Should I do garlic? Garlic is area. Oh, look at all these
[1026.38s -> 1035.10s]  crunchies up here. All right. Here we go. Skull. Oh, maniac. Do I really want to do that this early?
[1035.10s -> 1045.00s]  That kind of sucks this early. I feel like I don't want that. Maybe later. Well, hopefully
[1045.00s -> 1054.68s]  will it come up? Maybe you just get one. Oh, it's just one. It's not more. Oh, I thought it
[1054.68s -> 1065.48s]  leveled up. Okay. Banish it. Oh, you know, fuck it. Let's go. I'm not like, I've never played this
[1065.48s -> 1085.22s]  game before. I'll be all right. Security. Yep. Did someone say the wings were for, um, shadow
[1085.22s -> 1106.55s]  opinion? Is that legit? That last 0.3 seconds longer, which is better. How come it's I'm
[1106.55s -> 1122.50s]  confused. I turned to the left and it shot to the right. Oh my God. 15 minutes. That'll be good.
[1123.74s -> 1134.09s]  Gallic. Look at that area. Are you so greasy? Um, cause I'm just like a wet, I'm a wet person.
[1134.09s -> 1141.64s]  I'm just a moist person. You know, I didn't want to pick that up. People ask, dude, how come you
[1141.64s -> 1147.32s]  look so young? You look young, man. Wow. How old are you? Well, you look young. And I, you know,
[1147.32s -> 1151.40s]  I'm just, I'm very wet person. My skin is very, it's always moist. It's always moisturized.
[1151.96s -> 1162.10s]  If there's another shit, I have a black eye shadow again. I think I do. I, I very like moist,
[1162.10s -> 1170.76s]  moisturized skin. So how come it doesn't say it on there? You guys lied to me. Your lighting
[1170.76s -> 1176.95s]  setup doesn't do you any favors. I don't, I don't care about it doing me any favors. I'm just,
[1176.95s -> 1181.35s]  I'm just a guy sitting here hanging out. I don't need to buy what you want me to have like studio
[1181.35s -> 1190.98s]  lighting in here. I'm just a wet person. Did you guys actually lie to me or does that,
[1190.98s -> 1206.90s]  wouldn't it usually say it on the tool tip? These things are probably going to be awesome a little
[1206.90s -> 1209.70s]  bit later. I need cool down, right? Cause then it will happen to be like,
[1211.94s -> 1235.93s]  the odd, these guys take two hits, right? What we got? I'll take the whip. That's fine. Duplicator.
[1235.93s -> 1252.33s]  Yep. I guess I could just activate it fast. I'm going to go down and get whatever the item is
[1256.02s -> 1260.82s]  more. Okay. Yep. Let's get this thing maxed out. You kind of remind me. Well,
[1260.82s -> 1264.02s]  you didn't say who I remind you of. So I don't know who I remind you of.
[1264.82s -> 1286.26s]  I can't believe this game is read. Is this game still $3? Is it a little bit more expensive now?
[1289.10s -> 1299.72s]  Five now. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it's worth more than three dollars. You know what I'm saying?
[1301.66s -> 1320.74s]  Ooh. All right. Lightning ring. Although yeah, let's yes. Garlic again. What does garlic level
[1320.74s -> 1334.15s]  up with? It's not the book, right? Bro. You look like liquid Shaggy. Okay. Wait,
[1334.15s -> 1340.07s]  I'm not going to look at chat. Do you mean liquid Shaggy as in Shaggy that is made out of liquid?
[1340.07s -> 1345.83s]  Cause I talked about how wet I was. Or are you referring to like liquid Shaggy like this?
[1346.39s -> 1350.55s]  It's me. Liquid Shaggy. Is that what you mean? Like I'm the evil. Like that's what you mean?
[1350.55s -> 1360.98s]  Okay. I didn't know how exactly what you meant by that because both make sense. Liquid Shaggy.
[1362.10s -> 1374.98s]  I'm going to get smashed by that. We're good. All right. This is where it starts to get a
[1374.98s -> 1403.46s]  little hairy here. This weapon is actually really good. Stop distracting me. You guys are typing.
[1403.46s -> 1407.70s]  I see words scrolling up out of my peripheral. I can stop typing. I can see it.
[1419.32s -> 1442.01s]  Come on. Thank you. Thank you. I have to go down because it is a thing to collect down there. I
[1442.01s -> 1464.70s]  don't know. What even is that? Whip again. I need some more stuff. I haven't seen any garlic in like
[1464.70s -> 1488.81s]  feels like two, three years. All right. I got max whip as bit rate. We look good. Can you make out
[1488.81s -> 1521.16s]  anything that's going on? I'm going down after this. Shit better. What's new in this patch?
[1521.96s -> 1526.60s]  There's a bunch of stuff. I'll be honest though. I can't really tell you what is exactly in this
[1526.60s -> 1531.64s]  patch that wasn't in the game before this patch because it's been probably five plus patches
[1531.64s -> 1539.85s]  since I've played this game. There you go. There's a lot of stuff though. This seems
[1539.85s -> 1543.38s]  like there's been a lot of new content, but they'll put on the chat integration.
[1544.68s -> 1548.92s]  Yeah. I'll turn it on once I get a second here. I just want to do like one. I want to warm up.
[1548.92s -> 1554.68s]  I want to warm up and play it a couple of times because I don't want you guys to be able to spawn
[1554.68s -> 1560.12s]  bosses and I haven't played the game in like a month or two and I just lose. Let me warm up.
[1571.77s -> 1577.35s]  What if I, I don't have a, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's definitely cool down. Both of these
[1577.35s -> 1599.53s]  are good. It's definitely this one. Does the spear have a, uh, evolution? I feel like it doesn't.
[1609.10s -> 1617.96s]  Ooh, it looks like a gas station employee. What do you mean? Like just a person? I look like a
[1617.96s -> 1641.43s]  person. Oh, hey, you look, you look like a guy. Yeah. Okay. Like dude, please turn the fog filter
[1641.43s -> 1667.77s]  off. I want something better than that. D minus two. Dump it. I stole that from Seth.
[1673.02s -> 1681.11s]  You look like Peter Pan. All right. All right. Yeah. I look like a lot of people, apparently.
[1681.11s -> 1686.07s]  Yeah. I look like Peter Pan. I look like, uh, Jim Carrey. I look like Willem Dafoe. I look like
[1686.07s -> 1696.70s]  fucking Kramer. I look like everybody, apparently. Yeah. I look, people look similar. So by people
[1696.70s -> 1701.58s]  that I look similar to happen to be, I'm sorry. They happen to be incredibly handsome people.
[1703.03s -> 1710.42s]  That's all right. Keep, keep telling me. I look like who's wicked handsome out of that group.
[1713.58s -> 1720.65s]  Don't forget. I do not look like Jerry fucking Seinfeld, dude. No, you can't just because the
[1720.65s -> 1727.78s]  guy. All right. Just because they have, just because they're a brown hair white guy does not
[1727.78s -> 1742.42s]  mean they are Jerva nine eight five. Okay. People that was risky. I did it. Yes, it does.
[1756.84s -> 1779.53s]  Actually, I don't even want that. You look like my dad. You look like Peter Pan. It's because I'm
[1779.53s -> 1783.61s]  okay. And also when I wear like a different colored shirt, it makes me other characters.
[1784.41s -> 1789.26s]  Hey, anybody else think he looks like fucking Shaggy today? Yeah. Cause I got a green shirt on
[1790.06s -> 1806.57s]  dude. Anybody think he looks like fucking Robin today? I got a red shirt on. You do look like,
[1806.57s -> 1813.06s]  all right. I do look, I do look like Shaggy. I do. And I do look like Jim Carrey. I do look like,
[1813.06s -> 1816.98s]  I look like all these people. All right. I look like Willem Dafoe. I know I get it. Okay.
[1817.62s -> 1828.66s]  I get it. That's fine. That's all right. Peter Pan. Peter Pan might be my favorite one for the
[1828.66s -> 1839.22s]  last few weeks. What is that? Bigger, longer, faster, stronger. It's like a blowtorch.
[1841.26s -> 1856.26s]  Holy shit. Oh my goodness. Okay. You weren't lying. Don't, don't, don't give me any ideas.
[1857.62s -> 1864.82s]  I will rig up a fucking wire system in this room and I'll play a Peter Pan song and start
[1864.82s -> 1869.70s]  to fly around the room. You understand? I will do that. If you, if you keep harping on this
[1870.42s -> 1878.76s]  and then it'll go to a full cam and I'll just be flying around the room and then I'll sit back down
[1879.32s -> 1898.26s]  and give me a re-roll on this. This one's definitely a lock. I might do the whole thing,
[1898.26s -> 1912.63s]  actually. Do a Batman cosplay. I would be an awful Batman. I would not make a very good Batman.
[1914.92s -> 1920.52s]  Guys, I would look, I would kind of look like a dork in a Batman outfit. I'd look like a dork.
[1921.32s -> 1928.79s]  My posture's kind of, my posture sucks. I'm kind of smaller and my posture's bad. My arms are big.
[1928.79s -> 1933.85s]  My legs aren't. I would, I would look like, I think I would look like shit in a Batman costume.
[1933.85s -> 1952.09s]  I would look weird. I don't think I would look all right. That's the point though. Dude, do you
[1952.09s -> 1956.57s]  guys think, and some of you, some of you people, some of you guys in here might be this. I don't
[1956.57s -> 1963.85s]  know. If you're huge and jacked and you're just fucking massive, you're like a big muscular dude.
[1964.57s -> 1970.39s]  Do you sit around and go like, I'm fucking Batman. I get to be Batman this year.
[1970.39s -> 1972.95s]  I'm going to be Superman this year and I'm going to look like Superman.
[1973.67s -> 1978.10s]  Like, do you get ready to put the Bane costume on and be like,
[1979.22s -> 1985.50s]  I'm fucking Bane. Look at me. You know what I mean? If I was huge,
[1986.66s -> 1990.50s]  it would, I would not give a shit about being stronger. I would not care about,
[1990.50s -> 1995.14s]  oh, you can reach higher shelves. Oh, you're a lot bigger and stronger. Oh, I can lift boxes.
[1995.14s -> 2002.68s]  Nope. Every October 31st, I get to be Superman and I get to really be Superman and I get to look
[2002.68s -> 2013.26s]  like Superman. I would, I get to be Superman. That's why I think it was cool. You get to walk
[2013.26s -> 2028.31s]  around, you know, like this up with your chest out, like citizen. Like you're huge. You get to
[2028.31s -> 2035.83s]  pick every October 31st, a superhero that you get to be. You can just do it. Oh, Wolverine. Done.
[2035.83s -> 2044.10s]  Give me the metal claws. I can make that work. Style my hair like his. You know, I get to pick
[2044.10s -> 2057.00s]  rum every Halloween. Harry Potter characters. You know, I get, I get to be like the Riddler.
[2058.17s -> 2074.10s]  That's it. I get to be Shaggy, the green goblin. I've even the green goblin. Shaggy's cool. Shaggy
[2074.10s -> 2104.89s]  is cool. You are Jack though. No, I used to be. Not anymore. Yeah, dude, if I was huge and I'm,
[2104.89s -> 2129.69s]  when I say huge, I mean like, like six, four, like 200 fuck, but you're actually old.
[2130.70s -> 2141.90s]  Nobody tell them. There we go. Um, well, I definitely don't want to see this ever again.
[2145.53s -> 2163.80s]  Oh my God. All right. Um, cool down, right? Yep. Okay. Uh, be Groggy Gary for Halloween.
[2163.80s -> 2172.76s]  You could be Santa. No, I couldn't. I would be an elf. The huge guy gets to be Santa. I have to wear
[2172.76s -> 2178.84s]  the funny hat and the funny shoes and be like walking around my friend who gets to be Santa Claus.
[2179.56s -> 2207.19s]  So you could be whatever you want for Halloween. You could be the Joker.
[2208.23s -> 2227.67s]  That's right. I could, I could. Yeah. All right. There's no way I don't make it to 15.
[2228.31s -> 2239.08s]  Yeah. Like I've said this before, I'm going to say it again. All you need to do should be a good
[2239.08s -> 2251.30s]  Joker. Just put the makeup on and go like this. Every other sentence. See my father, everyone will
[2251.30s -> 2316.63s]  go. Oh, what do I want for my last item? The clock. What's this? Oh, it's the super
[2316.63s -> 2334.44s]  manna. You know, you know, who's a, an absolutely fucking hilarious motherfucker that needs more
[2334.44s -> 2342.84s]  credit for how funny they are myth. If you guys, if you guys don't follow myths, he, he did this
[2342.84s -> 2348.76s]  video recently. He did a Joker video where he was doing the Joker as XQC doing the, that famous rant.
[2349.40s -> 2358.74s]  I was just laughing my ass off. He's, he like did like a Joker XQC thing. It was just like
[2358.74s -> 2379.00s]  with like the music in the background. It was funny. Oh my God. Don't die. Oh, that's super
[2379.00s -> 2414.33s]  thunder. Oh, the levels are just rolling in recently. That was 11 months ago. Why did I
[2414.33s -> 2430.01s]  just see that in my feet? Do I open Twitter so infrequently that what do you wait? Hold on.
[2430.01s -> 2444.57s]  When did he upload that? I saw that literally like one day ago. Somebody must've retweeted it
[2444.57s -> 2457.83s]  or something. Why did I just see that a day ago? Why did I just see that? It was a year ago.
[2458.87s -> 2477.93s]  Do I seriously? What? Why did I just see this? I don't, I don't know. I genuinely do not know why
[2477.93s -> 2511.99s]  I just saw that. Oh, you guys lying to me. Okay. Dude, you got to keep up with like your Twitter.
[2512.63s -> 2518.94s]  Dude, I don't keep up with anything. I don't even use the computer. I'm just telling you.
[2518.94s -> 2524.86s]  The only time I use the computer is right now with, with you all. I don't use the computer.
[2524.86s -> 2549.45s]  I don't use the internet. Oh, nice. Oh my God. Look at this. What the fuck? You see that? How much
[2549.45s -> 2566.33s]  damage I'm doing. Oh, what is this? All the way. Oh, that means this is the only thing that shows
[2566.33s -> 2580.46s]  up forever. I get it. All right. I don't know. Twitter is weird, right? People, I got messages
[2580.46s -> 2584.70s]  from people saying, Hey dude, why did you like a bunch of like tweets you made in like 2014 or
[2584.70s -> 2595.82s]  something? And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? I didn't do anything. I don't,
[2595.82s -> 2602.52s]  apparently I went back and liked a bunch of old tweets. I didn't do that. Does it bug?
[2611.10s -> 2617.75s]  All right. Well, Ooh, level up. Oh, that's actually awesome. So it doesn't go to the
[2617.75s -> 2630.26s]  screen. That's cool. But anyways, TLDR myth is a really, really funny person. Very good on camera.
[2630.26s -> 2672.09s]  Really funny. And that's all. That's what I was trying to say. Watch out boss. This guy, you look
[2672.09s -> 2697.18s]  like a wise guy. Okay. We've evolved. We've evolved. It's no longer. Hey dude, you look like Shaggy.
[2697.18s -> 2713.56s]  You look like Peter Pan. You look like a wise guy. Gold fever. Oh my goodness. What's happening?
[2713.56s -> 2832.57s]  Why is this happening? Holy shit. Just $7,000. Holy shit. Sweating. No, pretty can't even touch me.
[2832.57s -> 2866.58s]  I just stand still. That's not fun. We got to get to level a hundred. Gotta get to 80. Oh, I'll get it.
[2866.58s -> 2874.38s]  I got 10 more minutes. I'm going to get to like level a hundred. How's the quality look?
[2875.02s -> 2893.99s]  Can you see shit? Oh, I'm like, I'm like talking to something. These games are great. I can just do
[2893.99s -> 2962.66s]  this. Gold fever. I'm just going to go down. Holy shit. It looks like it hurt. Liars. Liars.
[2964.49s -> 2987.42s]  Myth put that video up on Twitter literally yesterday. Liars. I won. I win. Everybody ban
[2987.42s -> 3039.88s]  everybody that said no. I want a massive timeout for five seconds. I don't want to. Okay. Is this
[3039.88s -> 3045.32s]  game even fun? Yeah, dude. Hey, don't look at what I'm doing here. And she deterred from purchasing
[3045.32s -> 3053.11s]  this. I got a little bit of experience in the game. Uh, I have dozens and dozens of hours playing
[3053.11s -> 3057.59s]  this game, I think. So, I mean, I am at a level where I've got all the power ups. I've unlocked
[3057.59s -> 3062.47s]  tons of stuff. You're going to be starting at nothing. You can be starting at zero and you're
[3062.47s -> 3072.70s]  going to be walking around getting your ass kicked by the first enemy of the game. So just,
[3072.70s -> 3076.62s]  just know where you are right now. I have a lot of experience in the game. I'm probably one of the
[3076.62s -> 3085.19s]  most, uh, one of the most experienced Empire survivors. Um, no, I don't, I don't need to say
[3085.19s -> 3119.46s]  it or anything, right? Like, I'm one of like, you guys know, you have those big hands. My God,
[3119.46s -> 3148.25s]  just die already. Just die already. Oh my goodness. You still alive? Why are you still alive?
[3149.29s -> 3209.91s]  Why are you still alive? Why are you so blushy? There's blood in my face. Lots of it. There's
[3209.91s -> 3227.10s]  another one. I haven't even killed the first one. I don't think I'm going to get to 100,
[3227.66s -> 3251.11s]  but I got to 80. That's all I wanted, right? That is the first one. I can't believe I've made
[3251.11s -> 3257.18s]  almost 10 grand. That first money, um, coined insanity, whatever it was. I don't think I've
[3257.18s -> 3300.63s]  ever seen anything like that ever again. I put that down so meanly. Evil German. Dark Uga.
[3302.78s -> 3321.02s]  Do you eat Taco Bell? Yeah, I love Taco Bell. Well, I love one item in Taco Bell and it puts,
[3321.02s -> 3332.95s]  it puts Taco Bell at S tier. Uh, Cheesy Gordita Crunch is the only thing that puts Taco Bell above
[3332.95s -> 3341.82s]  B. The only thing. Don't, don't come at me with this, you know, oh, you're going to get the,
[3341.82s -> 3351.08s]  no, don't even come at me with that. Cheesy Gordita's Cheesy Gordita Crunch with a Doritos
[3351.72s -> 3358.60s]  Taco inside the Cheesy Gordita Crunch. There will never be a fast food item ever. Yeah,
[3358.68s -> 3381.96s]  that will be as good. Never. It's impossible. In fact, I feel like Taco Bell is probably
[3381.96s -> 3390.44s]  pissed. It's like, oh shit, we made literally the best fast food item to ever exist and no one will
[3390.44s -> 3393.96s]  ever come close ever again for the rest of the entire time we're still alive in humanity.
[3394.92s -> 3398.52s]  Like we can't make anything else that people would even care about because we made that already.
[3413.26s -> 3422.52s]  And quit and cash in leftover revives. Oh, do I really? I don't really care. All right. I got
[3422.52s -> 3436.71s]  some, uh, Capella Magna. I unlocked the Shadow Pinyon. I got 500 gold coins. Cool. All right,
[3436.71s -> 3451.93s]  nice. Nice. What else we got? Hold six different weapon evolutions. Find the Grim Grimmuar.
[3451.93s -> 3462.65s]  Find the Magic Banger. Find the Ars Guda. Find and buy the Glass Vizard. Gr, what did I say?
[3465.51s -> 3475.99s]  Magic Banger. Find the Great Gospel. You get Limit Break. Inverse Mode. There's a lot. Oh,
[3475.99s -> 3491.10s]  my goodness. Look at all this shit. The Trumpet. All right, what should I try to get here? What
[3491.10s -> 3498.58s]  should I do? Why did you have a Q-tip covered in lip balm in a plastic bag during juiced?
[3498.58s -> 3503.19s]  Um, well, that's very simple. I couldn't explain it because we're in the middle of a show, but
[3503.19s -> 3511.05s]  so I use this a lot. I do. So I don't, okay, I know that you really shouldn't be using ChapStick
[3511.05s -> 3517.03s]  that often, but I live in Nevada. I live in Las Vegas and it gets very dry out here. Incredibly
[3517.03s -> 3522.76s]  dry. Um, so this helps. I try not to use it too. I don't usually use this unless I'm talking a lot
[3522.76s -> 3527.70s]  because when you're talking a lot, you're essentially drying out your mouth and lips
[3527.70s -> 3534.07s]  because the air coming in and out. We're like, blah, blah, blah, blah. So it helps while you're
[3534.07s -> 3542.47s]  talking to keep your mouth moistened. If I don't do this, you'll notice I will lick my lips all the
[3542.47s -> 3553.32s]  time because if I'm talking a lot, I have to, you know, constantly be licking my lips. I am the
[3553.32s -> 3567.45s]  fucking joker. No, don't say you're the joker. Don't do that. Stop that. If you say you're the
[3567.45s -> 3583.64s]  joker, you're actually the penguin. Don't do that. Don't, Jeremy, don't do that. Don't ever believe
[3583.64s -> 3588.65s]  anybody if they say they're the joker, right? People that say they're the Riddler are actually
[3588.65s -> 3594.52s]  the joker. People that say they're the joker, they're actually the penguin. People that say
[3594.52s -> 3609.10s]  they're the penguin are telling you the truth. They're telling you the truth. Penguin mains are
[3609.10s -> 3612.94s]  based. You already said this before. Yeah, there's like a bunch of new viewers. Come on, I gotta get
[3612.94s -> 3631.03s]  my, I just like scraped you. Who are you then? I don't, I don't, I don't know. We're talking
[3631.03s -> 3644.10s]  into all of Batman? You'd be the scarecrow. I don't know if I'd be the scarecrow. You'd be
[3644.10s -> 3653.29s]  Peter Pan. Oh yeah, Batman's famous rogues gallery. Peter Pan. I wouldn't be Mr. Freeze.
[3653.37s -> 3660.09s]  I wouldn't. I don't want that to spill on me. All right, uh, let me do,
[3660.89s -> 3663.05s]  I'll do one more with the twitch integration and then we'll move on,
[3663.05s -> 3683.42s]  play some Gotham Knights. This is work. Let's see. I think it's on. Is it on?
[3683.42s -> 3701.46s]  Hold on, let me do this. All right, yeah, it's on, I think. So what do I want to try to go for here?
[3701.46s -> 3706.18s]  Six different weapon evolutions survive 30 minutes with either Gallo or Divano.
[3706.18s -> 3721.96s]  All right, so I'm going to try Gallo or Divano. Gallo? I don't have either one of those. Gallo
[3721.96s -> 3738.84s]  or Divano? Am I not seeing it? I don't have either one of those people. Why, oh, why the Q-tips? Okay,
[3739.48s -> 3748.39s]  so I didn't have any chapstick with me when I was at Juiced and the, um, I was kind of figuring out
[3748.39s -> 3753.59s]  where have I, where can I get one of these? I need, I need something to be able to put on. Um,
[3753.59s -> 3757.64s]  and there was a, there was a makeup artist that was there and it was like, oh, no, no,
[3757.64s -> 3761.08s]  I actually have something. You could use this. It's gonna be kind of weird, but, um, it's like
[3761.08s -> 3764.60s]  just a little bit of Vaseline. You can put that there, uh, just a little bit to kind of use that
[3764.60s -> 3769.46s]  for what you, you know, needed it for. And I was like, oh, okay, cool. So I used it and I was like,
[3769.46s -> 3774.65s]  oh, that worked great. And I put it in the pocket and I just forgot it was there and I got called
[3774.65s -> 3790.71s]  out for it. Bro, why was it dirty? I don't, I, that I don't know. I feel like it was because of maybe
[3790.71s -> 3796.39s]  like the makeup or something when I did it and I got the makeup on it. I don't know. All right,
[3796.39s -> 3805.08s]  so where are these? I don't have these two characters. Survive 30 minutes with either
[3805.08s -> 3820.23s]  Gallo or Divano. How do I unlock Gallo or Divano? This, Forbidden Squirrels? This is question mark.
[3820.23s -> 3833.96s]  Oh, Sir Ambrojo. No, it's my coffin. Your mic sounds like shit. No, it doesn't. That's fine.
[3833.96s -> 3838.98s]  Just pick up stuff you missed on the stages. All right, well, let's just go for it then.
[3839.85s -> 3846.52s]  I'm going to go with, what is that, a wheel? Have I ever played with this character? I'm going to
[3846.52s -> 3855.86s]  play with the wheel character. More projectiles every 20 levels. Okay, yeah, let's do the wheel.
[3855.86s -> 3859.86s]  So I'm assuming the ones with the exclamation points on it are, I need to go and get stuff
[3859.86s -> 3867.22s]  there. So let's do Moon Glow. I also have this, a weird filter on this camera. This camera's weird.
[3867.22s -> 3885.86s]  Let's go to Moon Glow. Fancy a new, oh, there it is. Look. Merchant is in all stages now.
[3885.86s -> 3897.85s]  Golden Egg? What should I do? What should I do? I'm going to keep the wheel. What is this move?
[3898.73s -> 3903.43s]  Okay, so this is a projectile character. Why do I only have one? What's going on?
[3904.95s -> 3911.06s]  Oh, you guys have to vote. I can't pick anything. What did you just give me?
[3917.24s -> 3925.43s]  Thanks. Look at all these things out here. All right, this is going to be a fucking disaster.
[3927.00s -> 3929.48s]  I'm not going to pick up anything yet because I don't know what I want to do.
[3930.12s -> 3934.98s]  And I'm not going to touch anything. Twitch, what is...
[3936.58s -> 3941.82s]  Yeah, oh, why didn't you start with this? I wonder why. Is it showing all of your names?
[3944.79s -> 3955.40s]  That's, okay, that's weird. What am I going to get? I wonder how long it lasts.
[3962.30s -> 3981.93s]  Oh, thanks for the luck boost. Thanks, guys. All right, you only have like
[3981.93s -> 3987.29s]  five seconds to choose, so be ready if you want to participate because I can't do any of this.
[3988.55s -> 4010.95s]  It's all up to you. Move your cam so we can see. You can see. Okay, here we go.
[4023.02s -> 4055.22s]  Lights. What is light sources? I keep trying to pick and I can't. He's melting again. All right,
[4055.22s -> 4073.48s]  what is it? How am I supposed to deal with this? I'm level four. This isn't fair. Ah,
[4073.48s -> 4097.58s]  it disappears after a minute. Sorry, guys. Get wrecked. Not quite. Is the Twitch integration
[4097.58s -> 4103.46s]  for 1.0? I feel like that was not here a month or two ago when I played the last.
[4105.69s -> 4120.01s]  Oh, I can't. I forgot. I can't ask questions because all. Okay, I can ask a question if the
[4120.01s -> 4135.05s]  answer is one, two, three, four or A, B or C. Guys, what number is the month for April? Oh,
[4135.05s -> 4154.62s]  never mind. What just happened? You guys just gave me like a power up or something. I don't know.
[4154.62s -> 4177.86s]  Give me the double guns. Don't. Why don't. Why would you give me the wand? You picked. Why would
[4177.86s -> 4204.95s]  you pick the wand? You just screwed everything up. Give me double guns, not wand. Great.
[4205.91s -> 4210.57s]  So what happens now? Did you guys? You're in the middle of voting by the way.
[4210.57s -> 4214.98s]  Thank you. A clueless machine for your support of the stream. Appreciate it.
[4229.14s -> 4245.51s]  Definitely keep making these bigger. This thing. These things are great. Actually carts. Well,
[4245.51s -> 4254.70s]  what month is March? What number is March? What month is March? What number month is March? Thank
[4254.70s -> 4299.69s]  you. A lot of food. Are there any coffins? Okay. Give me the gun. Do the gun. I demand. I command
[4299.69s -> 4341.66s]  you to pick one ghost swarm. Uh, I don't know what to pick. Oh, it's ghost swarm times 10.
[4341.66s -> 4359.37s]  There's 10 of them at, uh, at Corello. I've been pretty good, but it certainly looked like a
[4359.37s -> 4367.78s]  different person. Every stream. Um, sometimes you, your hair is done a different way. You're
[4368.98s -> 4374.70s]  if you have facial hair, do you not have facial hair? I will tell you guys that I do get, I do
[4374.70s -> 4382.62s]  have a lot of different looks. I sometimes would be clean shaved and then randomly like you'll see
[4382.62s -> 4388.17s]  me four days later and I have like a beard. It's just like, where'd the other guy go? Well,
[4388.17s -> 4419.42s]  if my hair will be different, I get it. I do base damage up by 30 cool down. I want to,
[4419.42s -> 4425.38s]  does this thing have an evolution? Cause I want to see it. It's just a huge car that drives around.
[4426.10s -> 4440.14s]  I really hope that once I get to like level 30, 40, 50, that you guys don't have to pick every
[4440.14s -> 4444.86s]  single time when it gets to the, do you want the box or do you want, I gotta make sure I make it
[4444.86s -> 4466.81s]  always around the whole circle, 20% more area. Go get all the items on the floor. But you didn't
[4466.81s -> 4490.44s]  vote for that. I guess I could, right? Could I just go pick up every single item? Done. Done.
[4490.44s -> 4504.23s]  Should I pick up every item on the floor? I don't know. I can't even ask a question because
[4504.23s -> 4533.50s]  nobody can answer it. Only do that after you fill every slot. Okay. Three more luck. I didn't want
[4533.50s -> 4553.72s]  to pick that up. I wanted to save that. I'm shaking my head, dude. I mean, I would say it's probably
[4553.72s -> 4579.93s]  two, right? Be dumb. All right. I'm going to get the magnet. There's a lot of stuff on the floor.
[4580.01s -> 4614.86s]  Good luck. You're going to have to level up like three times. Thank you. Interesting. Now what?
[4614.86s -> 4621.99s]  I feel, okay, this is going to be so messed up here because there are a lot of people that are
[4621.99s -> 4625.43s]  on more than a five to 10 second delay on the stream thing on your internet connection and
[4625.43s -> 4630.47s]  where you are in the world or whatever. So tons of you guys I think are voting for the like third
[4630.47s -> 4635.46s]  level. And that was like the fifth level. I don't, I think this is going to be a little messed up.
[4636.26s -> 4666.92s]  Oh shit. All right. I'm making it hard. Okay. Can I even kill these things? Thank God for the
[4666.92s -> 4693.90s]  mine carts. Done. This is actually, I thought you guys were going to make like a ha ha killed
[4693.90s -> 4717.74s]  the streamer build. Um, but this is actually pretty good. Nice job. Nice work. Thanks, Peter.
[4717.74s -> 4740.31s]  I don't know what I did. Oh, I said good job. You're right. Oh, yep. Why do you have such a
[4740.31s -> 4774.95s]  crooked face? Um, because I have a crooked face. Mean chat member. Ooh, yep. Get it. Get that. Get
[4774.95s -> 4782.50s]  that. That's the big one. That's one of the best items in the whole game. That is the best evolution
[4782.50s -> 4811.22s]  in the whole game in my personal. Yes. Hell yeah. Um, I'm not picking up all the items yet. I still
[4811.22s -> 4830.44s]  have plenty of time. It seems like it's going to be pretty good. These things explode. Okay. Well,
[4830.52s -> 4840.70s]  yeah, I'm dead. I get to come back, but I'm dead. Dude, how the fuck am I supposed to beat that?
[4840.70s -> 4869.61s]  I can revive one more time. That lasts literally forever. Kill them. Oh, I got the merchant and
[4869.61s -> 4878.50s]  everything. Okay. That's impossible. I mean, it wasn't impossible. It was just improbable.
[4878.50s -> 4891.45s]  Wow. You did it. All right. Um, anything. One more. One more and we move to Gotham Knights.
[4891.45s -> 4897.22s]  We'll do one more. This time. Don't press the button. That's going to end the run instantly.
[4897.22s -> 4913.40s]  Give me the free shit. Who should I play with? I'll let you guys decide this. Who should I
[4913.40s -> 4930.38s]  play with? Play with the dog? Dog? Why do you look like Shaggy and Fred at the same time?
[4930.38s -> 4940.81s]  I'll do dog. And where should I go? Just probably the library stage two. Yeah. Anything with an
[4940.81s -> 4966.60s]  exclamation point. Oh yeah. They have relics. All right. I'm going to do the library. Uh,
[4966.60s -> 4973.45s]  should I turn any of these on or who cares? This dude's got wicked extraterrestrial eyes today.
[4973.45s -> 4988.14s]  Okay. Put our con is on hyper and hurry. No, I don't want to hurry. That's annoying to me.
[4988.14s -> 5000.65s]  I don't know what I don't know what to do here. Feeling. All right. What's this feeling is doubled
[5000.65s -> 5007.67s]  recovering HP damages nearby enemies for the same amount listed weapon projectiles gain up to three
[5007.67s -> 5016.55s]  bounces. That's insane. Overall area continuously changes between minus 25 and plus 25% over 10
[5016.55s -> 5028.41s]  seconds. Overall duration continuously changes between minus 50 and plus 50%. Enables critical
[5028.41s -> 5034.20s]  hits for listed weapons doubles overall critical damage. That sounds incredible. Um, what does this
[5034.20s -> 5046.14s]  character start with? The flowers, right? Those are, is that technically a projectile? The ones
[5046.14s -> 5057.05s]  that bounce. It's not a projectile. It's not listed at all. Do the healing one. Oh, that is listed.
[5057.13s -> 5073.56s]  All right. We're going to do that. Why did I pick that up? Give me something good. How often do you
[5073.56s -> 5093.34s]  get a sunburn all the time, all the time? Uh, I am Irish and Polish. So, I mean, I burn pretty quickly.
[5094.34s -> 5111.30s]  My, my, like I very kind of light, um, skin. So like I, it burns very, very quickly. There's also
[5111.30s -> 5115.14s]  like other, I mean, I, I could give you my entire, I don't, I don't, I've literally done kind of
[5115.30s -> 5123.96s]  no, there's no kind of what I've been told. It's like a Eastern, you know, Eastern European,
[5123.96s -> 5164.81s]  Irish, I don't know, Polish. Stop doing this to me. The stream is getting angry. Hey guys,
[5165.53s -> 5194.23s]  what the, what the fuck would you guys do? I like the dog's basket. Maybe if there wasn't
[5194.23s -> 5210.94s]  a inescapable jelly wall, I would be able to get out of here. The heel is so good on this character.
[5210.94s -> 5224.65s]  It really is. The song is really good too. This game is just really good. This thing's three dollars.
[5225.29s -> 5241.70s]  I hope whoever made this made a really good amount of money. I mean, you deserve it. What the fuck
[5241.70s -> 5261.99s]  was that? All right. I kind of like just, um, can you guys give me a weapon that can fucking kill
[5261.99s -> 5298.76s]  something? They probably made, they made bank. Don't the cats hurt you? The cats attack you.
[5299.56s -> 5324.28s]  I see you're going with the animal build. Okay. I see. Go get the item or I forget
[5325.08s -> 5347.42s]  and I will forget. Nevermind. Light sources. You like it because it's retro. No, I like it because
[5347.42s -> 5372.74s]  it's a really great idea. Guys, how many, we didn't do that. Then who did? You tell me you didn't do
[5372.74s -> 5399.06s]  this? Shit. I might die. Just got to get out of there. All right. I need food. Actually good
[5399.06s -> 5433.30s]  because I can heal, right? The flowers healed. You know what to do. Give me some health here.
[5436.17s -> 5452.23s]  Last 1.5 seconds. More projectiles or armor. School. Eventually when I have a bunch of speed
[5452.23s -> 5455.91s]  and I have a ton of this thing's leveled up all the way, I will heal to full health in one second.
[5455.91s -> 5486.22s]  Just get me there. What's this? I have to kill that, um, Grim Reaper guy. Need the other gun.
[5486.22s -> 5489.90s]  Yeah, you need the other gun. Don't forget that. Without the other gun, I'm in trouble.
[5493.56s -> 5541.38s]  How do you kill this guy? How do I get rid of this guy? Just evade. Okay. There we are. Stalker?
[5543.62s -> 5558.42s]  Dude, how? Cat ate the chicken. Yeah, the cats eat the food and they hurt you. A fully leveled
[5558.42s -> 5574.58s]  up cat though I think is pretty good, right? Give me the hell out of there. This guy can't
[5574.58s -> 5592.63s]  be killed either? No. Sorry. Don't have to worry about that. How far away am I? All right. I can
[5592.63s -> 5624.68s]  get there. Let's get a run. I like how a lot of the songs in this game go like, they all have that
[5624.68s -> 5643.27s]  same, uh, like bass drum that just goes, what? You skipped the passive? What do you mean I skipped
[5643.27s -> 5653.74s]  the passive? I missed a gift from chat. I did? I'll go back up and get it. Do I want that though?
[5653.74s -> 5657.74s]  I feel like I, I thought I'm not supposed to pick up passives until I get what I want.
[5658.54s -> 5668.38s]  Or do I want that one? I'm just saying if you jelly well me, I'm uninstalling the game and I'm
[5668.38s -> 5673.26s]  going to uninstall the fucking twitch stream. You give me a jelly while I'm uninstalling the game.
[5673.26s -> 5676.14s]  I'm just telling you, I'm just being completely honest with you. Yeah.
[5677.70s -> 5690.36s]  Actually that thing you just picked is probably worse. There it is.
[5692.47s -> 5697.99s]  Ars guda permanently allows to access the list of defeated enemies from the main menu.
[5700.78s -> 5718.41s]  What does this do? Oh my God. It's a, oh, okay. It's like a database. All right. Now I'll go back
[5718.41s -> 5760.63s]  up and get the nice gift that you gave me. I appreciate it. Almost got me. Didn't get me.
[5760.63s -> 5765.35s]  So I, should I pick, do we need any of this stuff? Should I pick the, um, these passives up? I
[5765.35s -> 5791.96s]  shouldn't. No, I'm not gonna. It's not worth it. I got to level up. I get the free one from chat.
[5791.96s -> 5808.57s]  Does that, doesn't it just take a slot? I got to level up. I'm very underleveled. I'm level 18
[5809.37s -> 5834.26s]  and there's 10 minutes. Get the orb. Actually a good idea. Whoever said that, that was a great
[5834.26s -> 5842.02s]  idea. And that person for an hour. Tell me what to do on my screen. Oh my God. I'm going to die.
[5842.74s -> 5872.94s]  I'm going to, you're going to kill me. Stupid fucking jelly. Well, I swear to God,
[5884.18s -> 5892.89s]  what did I, did a cat just eat that? Why did I not get it? Why did I not get that? I think
[5892.97s -> 5906.31s]  the cat destroyed that. Oh, where's it? Where's an orb? Wait, this is okay. There's a chest down.
[5906.31s -> 5926.31s]  There's an orb. All right. Get the chest first. I'll take it. Now there's an orb up. There's a
[5926.31s -> 5965.56s]  chest up. There's a lot of crunchies here to get exactly what I needed. Tons more luck and more
[5965.56s -> 5993.37s]  projectiles. Keep it up. It does suck that the cats eat the food though. I gotta get out of this.
[5993.45s -> 6015.91s]  We go up. Yep. Okay. There's a turkey and then there's up. Where's that chest? Right here.
[6016.55s -> 6035.35s]  I don't know. What does a pet even do? One more projectile. Cool. All right. Now give me the orb.
[6036.07s -> 6056.98s]  Does it heal maybe? I wonder. Oh shit. All right. I'm in trouble here. It's my brother's birthday.
[6056.98s -> 6078.54s]  Say happy birthday. Happy birthday to that person's brother. Happy birthday. No, seriously. What's that?
[6081.08s -> 6094.15s]  Oh, I get another one. I don't want that one. Enables critical hits for listed weapons,
[6094.95s -> 6105.61s]  which I only have. I don't have any of these. That's pretty big though. Although I only have
[6105.61s -> 6116.97s]  one of these. Which one? I could reroll it. Although I think this is probably the one.
[6119.64s -> 6127.13s]  It is. It's the only thing that's going to save me right now. Well, now definitely get the cross
[6127.13s -> 6139.62s]  upgrade when you can. It's a lot of experience here. I'm not going anywhere for a few minutes.
[6164.71s -> 6191.74s]  Yep. I'm going to soak all this up. Oh, I thought you were going to do pentagram. Okay.
[6191.74s -> 6197.30s]  Cats are going to kill you. Well, I didn't pick them. You should blame your fellow chatter.
[6197.86s -> 6217.08s]  I was going to go with side. Cross is doing so much. Play Peggle 2. No, I don't like Peggle 2.
[6217.08s -> 6231.43s]  It kind of sucks. It's okay. It was all right. I think Peggle 1 I had the most fun with.
[6233.27s -> 6253.03s]  I didn't. Peggle 2 was all right. You guys have to remember I'm older. So the first one that came
[6253.03s -> 6266.90s]  out, I'm always going to have a better opinion of because it's Peggle 1. You know, okay. I do
[6266.90s -> 6274.18s]  Peggle 2. I liked the second area. I liked that. I like that character because the song goes like
[6280.94s -> 6287.69s]  I don't like the first but the horse. What's the horse's name? Yorn or something, right?
[6288.33s -> 6294.90s]  The horse creeped me out. The way the horse does like the facial expressions the horse makes. It's
[6294.90s -> 6307.82s]  kind of like creepy. I don't know. The horse is, the horse freaks me out. This dude's scared of a
[6307.82s -> 6320.02s]  cartoon. Okay. Don't ever, don't ever jump back in your seat at a horror game when they try to scare
[6320.02s -> 6342.10s]  you. It's a fucking 3D CGI cartoon dude. Peggle is a horror game. I win. No, I win. I'm the streamer.
[6342.10s -> 6348.25s]  I win. Did you see how many people said true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true,
[6348.25s -> 6358.14s]  true. No, I win. I'm the streamer. So I win. Oh my what the hell's happening?
[6362.06s -> 6376.26s]  Understand the streamer can never be wrong. Streamer can never be wrong. This is real fun.
[6376.82s -> 6393.34s]  Do you mean that sarcastically? It actually is. I've never seen anything like that before. The
[6393.34s -> 6408.50s]  crosses are just, uh, this is definitely secure at this point. Good. Ooh. Yep. There it is. So now
[6408.50s -> 6419.98s]  this is going to be wild. I need more projectile speed. I need more projectiles. I give me what I
[6419.98s -> 6451.48s]  need. Wait, did you guys just do the attractor? Oh, for the, okay. Or, um, the water, right? It's
[6451.48s -> 6476.71s]  true. I meant it honestly. Oh, you're good. Don't worry. You're good. Let me look strange because
[6478.30s -> 6484.22s]  my camera is flipped horizontally. You are not used to seeing me from this angle. I am though.
[6485.18s -> 6491.77s]  So from the other angle, it's weird for me because that's correct. This is how I see myself
[6492.49s -> 6495.69s]  when I look in the mirror. So this looks normal to me. It looks weird to you.
[6496.57s -> 6512.44s]  The reason why a lot of people think they look weird in pictures is because that's a flipped
[6512.44s -> 6518.02s]  version of your face. Well, no, no, no. Yeah. Like the mirror is a flipped version of your face.
[6518.82s -> 6523.93s]  So you are, when you look in the mirror, you are not seeing what your face looks like.
[6524.57s -> 6538.20s]  That's always why if you look at a picture of yourself and you're like, wait, what's wrong with
[6538.20s -> 6550.55s]  my face? Chad is throwing right now. Yeah. What are you guys doing? Are you guys throwing on
[6550.55s -> 6560.54s]  purpose? What are you guys even selecting here? No, no. Why'd you get the axe? Why did you pick
[6560.54s -> 6570.12s]  the axe? What is going on with this build? It was going so well until like 30 seconds ago.
[6571.93s -> 6580.49s]  What happened? It's definitely because there's too many happening in a row and everyone that's
[6580.49s -> 6587.61s]  like, everyone that's from, okay, to all the EU viewers, you are voting for stuff that probably
[6587.61s -> 6610.14s]  happened 10 seconds ago. The EU viewers get the short end of the stick again. There's a 30 second
[6610.14s -> 6618.95s]  delay. So there's a, I have low latency mode on. So there's probably like a four, three to five
[6618.95s -> 6623.59s]  second delay. Yeah. So hold on a minute. I don't think anybody's voting for the right thing.
[6625.05s -> 6630.26s]  There's a three to five second delay with low latency. Also you have a delay to me
[6631.48s -> 6636.76s]  watching through the Twitch server. So it has to compress through and the bit rate has to
[6636.76s -> 6642.04s]  send it to you. So it's probably 10 plus seconds. So you guys are just pressing random numbers. I
[6642.04s -> 6660.26s]  think at this point it's working pretty well. My delay says 0.75 seconds, but might be one of my
[6660.26s -> 6694.18s]  neighbors. 0.75. That's no way. I mean, that person, that person's like on the Las Vegas
[6694.18s -> 6717.00s]  script right now. Just like watching. No, that would, no, not even 0.75 seconds means you are
[6717.00s -> 6748.74s]  like in the house. My delay is three seconds. Well, okay. So one second, correct me if I'm
[6748.74s -> 6756.10s]  wrong. Cause I, I mean, I know a little bit about networking, right? 1000 ping means one full second
[6756.10s -> 6764.25s]  delay, correct? Thanks for ruining the whole game by the way. Can't wait. Maybe not. That's correct.
[6766.49s -> 6778.78s]  1000 ping means one second is how long it takes to go from the server to you guys. My bit rate
[6778.78s -> 6785.18s]  sucks right now. I don't know what the hell yours looks like. Like my game's bit rate is actually
[6785.18s -> 6824.94s]  bad right now. I don't know what it could possibly be for you. How long does the panic thing last?
[6824.94s -> 6834.20s]  This feels like it's been a long time. All right, now I'm going to go start picking up everything.
[6835.08s -> 6855.99s]  Dude, forget about like, oh, if we went back in time and showed a caveman this, what would they say?
[6855.99s -> 6864.34s]  If you went back like 15 years or 20 years and showed a person this, they'd be like, what the
[6864.34s -> 6872.36s]  fuck is going on and why? What is that? I don't think you have to go back that far. Go back to like
[6872.36s -> 6877.40s]  the early 2000s or like if people would be like, what are you, what's happening to you?
[6877.40s -> 6901.42s]  What's going on? Can you explain this to me? That's wicked funny. Somebody said this looks
[6901.42s -> 6906.14s]  like a bath bomb. Wow. That's best chat of the best chatter of the entire evening.
[6909.11s -> 6916.38s]  It looks like a bath bomb. Dude, I can't move because of the panic.
[6917.18s -> 6929.96s]  Is that what it looks like? All right, hold on. Open the chest. I got it. It's this. Oh, yes. It's
[6929.96s -> 6965.80s]  the side. My favorite. It's fucked up. All right. You have to vote for three, vote for three. So we
[6965.80s -> 6977.38s]  don't have to keep doing this. Vote for three. All right. Bring it on. Give me everything. Give me
[6977.38s -> 6982.98s]  all you got. I'm talking jelly walls. I'm talking swarms. I'm talking monsters. I'm talking fast
[6982.98s -> 6996.92s]  extra speed for all monsters. Give me, give me everything you got. All right. There's a,
[6996.92s -> 7039.26s]  there's an orb right over here. I'm going to get it. A fucking bath bomb. Up. Oh, here we go.
[7039.26s -> 7050.07s]  I didn't do anything. Oh, yeah, I did. It was traveling. How many times do I level up? I leveled
[7050.07s -> 7064.79s]  up like 15 times. All right. If you did go back to like back in like the fucking 1500s and you had,
[7065.51s -> 7068.71s]  you know, you were surrounded by, you know, people with like muskets
[7069.67s -> 7074.07s]  and they saw this and you had to explain this to them or you were dead. You know what I mean?
[7074.07s -> 7078.78s]  Like you were a fucking warlock. What would you do? Like if you were to explain what's going on
[7078.78s -> 7093.24s]  right now? What is this? You have 10 seconds. What would you do? Be like, um, what would you say?
[7094.76s -> 7101.43s]  Would you blame it on like the devil or something? I think I would be on their side. I'd be like,
[7101.43s -> 7105.67s]  I have no idea. You have no idea. I don't know what that is either. It's the devil's work. We
[7105.67s -> 7109.03s]  must get rid of it. Right. Cause you, there's no way you're going to, it's not going to happen.
[7109.03s -> 7116.41s]  There's no way you have to like be on their team. Yeah. I don't know what that is,
[7116.41s -> 7138.12s]  but it needs to be banished and cast from our village. Oh, I finally got it. Say God made it.
[7138.12s -> 7144.04s]  No, no, I don't think so. No, I'm not saying that. Uh, the citizens would start to like recreate
[7144.04s -> 7154.62s]  this stuff. They would try to like make this real. Uh-uh. Like they would think this is, oh,
[7154.62s -> 7160.68s]  oh, we needed to make giant sides. That's what he wants. He wants us to make giant sides and
[7161.40s -> 7175.77s]  throw flowers at each other. Society would crumble. All right. How does my face look right now?
[7175.77s -> 7181.62s]  Should I go with some, how do you explain electricity? You don't. That's why I would
[7181.62s -> 7187.48s]  just be, you would just be on their team. You would just be like, I don't know. Where did you
[7187.48s -> 7193.77s]  come from? The woods. I've been in the woods. Yeah. I'll be in the woods this whole time. I've been in
[7193.77s -> 7203.77s]  the woods. Who's your parents? They died in the great battle that we had. All right. That checks
[7203.77s -> 7238.74s]  out was this one. Uh, oh yeah. Crits. How old are you? Uh, uh, uh, I don't know. 15. Oh, okay.
[7239.30s -> 7246.52s]  It's like, I don't know how long people live, right? I don't think people look like if I said
[7246.52s -> 7254.46s]  like 40, they'd be like, you mean 40, 40. What do you mean? How come you don't have gray hair?
[7254.46s -> 7280.34s]  You're not old. No. Yes. Oh, uh, Brian Michael is, is, is 38. He looks like this old ass guy.
[7281.99s -> 7312.73s]  It's not possible. Get rid of him. Kill him. All right. Um, so I'm just going to like stand here
[7313.45s -> 7318.81s]  because I need to reply to, uh, somebody in my agency. We're going to talk about the incoming,
[7318.81s -> 7323.53s]  the sponsor stuff for a second. So, um, I think I'm all right. I'm just going to take a second here.
[7356.60s -> 7364.70s]  What is, um, look at how, do you see how I'm, my game is running slow. Why am I going so slow?
[7366.54s -> 7384.42s]  Dude, it's actually, it's not, it's, it's slow motion. There's too many cats. Why am I? Look at
[7384.42s -> 7399.10s]  how slow this is. Okay. This has to stop. I'm just waiting for my Jeep, like, like CPU fan to go.
[7399.10s -> 7402.86s]  You know what I mean? You know, when you, you know, your computer is working real hard when
[7403.50s -> 7404.94s]  all of a sudden you just start hearing,
[7411.35s -> 7439.06s]  you're like, Oh, dude, you got to push the limits of the 30 90s. Somebody just asked me to go get
[7439.06s -> 7446.78s]  the armor up here. And it's like, I mean, I don't think I really need it. Can you even die? I don't
[7446.78s -> 7451.62s]  think so. I actually want to try to get to a hundred. So I'm just gonna stick around here.
[7451.62s -> 7493.72s]  I don't even need it. 104. What's the highest I think I've ever been. I'll be like close to here.
[7493.72s -> 7518.49s]  One five, one on 10. This is, this is definitely the most ridiculous, uh, like character I think
[7518.49s -> 7563.19s]  I've ever seen. Probably could have been crazier too. Okay. Give me the ultra wave. This five more
[7563.19s -> 7597.80s]  minutes. I got, I'm going to get to like 130. I'm going to get to like 150. Holy shit. My God.
[7634.12s -> 7640.01s]  Hey, I just realized that this is going to take 10 minutes because it's at like half speed.
[7640.09s -> 7649.66s]  It's counting at half speed, 30, 31, 32. It's almost three seconds for every one second.
[7649.66s -> 7656.06s]  This is going to take 15 minutes. This is going to be insane. It's at like 0.2 speed. So it's
[7656.06s -> 7688.73s]  count. Yeah. It's gonna be like 12 minutes. You're in slow mo as well. I am not. This is what Adderall
[7688.73s -> 7724.68s]  is doing to your brain. What dude, this shit is flavor blasted. You guys are on point today.
[7724.68s -> 7750.38s]  Really? You guys are on point this afternoon. 119. This is the highest I've ever been for sure.
[7751.02s -> 7775.78s]  There's still so much time left. I might get to 150 to be absurd. 17,000 gold too.
[7775.78s -> 7790.71s]  All right. I'm going to try to go this way to collect everything that died over here. Oh,
[7790.71s -> 7802.97s]  I picked up a, I picked up one of those things. Didn't I? Yep. The kind of stuff that they,
[7803.61s -> 7816.22s]  it's the kind of stuff they market to babies. Do we need, we need some like,
[7817.83s -> 7821.91s]  we need, we need the Muppets back. You know what I mean? Where are the fuck, where are the Muppets?
[7822.97s -> 7836.94s]  Where are the Muppets? We need, we need the Muppets. We need them back. Dude, this
[7838.86s -> 7866.79s]  Muppets level threat, but it is though you're, it is I'm at one, two, three. Should I just quit
[7866.79s -> 7881.32s]  the game right now? Four more minutes. Resident sleeper. I'm really sorry to that person, but
[7881.32s -> 7891.27s]  it's probably like seven or eight more minutes. This seems to be counting at two. It's like two
[7891.27s -> 7907.48s]  and a half seconds for every one second. Sometimes a little longer. Somebody just came in here and
[7907.48s -> 7916.70s]  said, what the fuck am I looking at? Um, demonic power. I agree. We should get rid of this. We
[7916.70s -> 7923.72s]  should, we should banish this. I'm on your side. I don't know what this is. It appeared in my,
[7923.72s -> 7932.07s]  it appeared next to my outhouse. Showed up in a portal that came from hell. And you know,
[7933.03s -> 7943.66s]  hold on. I just, I just saw a bunch of new enemies and I was like, wait, I have to pay attention.
[7956.87s -> 7961.27s]  You're from some crazy time in the future. What is happening? What are we looking at?
[7962.07s -> 7966.87s]  You could also become like wicked cool. Oh, well, this is what you're watching. It is the great war,
[7967.67s -> 7973.74s]  the great war of humanity. Explain to them that this is all, like all of this really happened.
[7983.99s -> 8007.03s]  What a ramble stream. They'd be like, it was me. I did this. Then point, point to somebody.
[8007.11s -> 8015.98s]  Oh, I want to be the first person to get their milk delivered forever. Okay. Okay.
[8016.86s -> 8035.35s]  This game is hurting my head. Um, I think it's hurting everybody's head right now.
[8035.35s -> 8050.87s]  Who delivers milk? Um, I don't know all the back in like the fucking 13, 1400s.
[8051.75s -> 8056.34s]  It was not, there was no grocery store back in like the 1400s.
[8057.22s -> 8065.43s]  It was like a butcher. It was a milkman. Okay. I think I gotta go forward a little bit. I gotta
[8065.43s -> 8081.10s]  go forward a little bit because the milkman was not back in like 1300s. It was like in the 20s.
[8087.69s -> 8099.16s]  The milkman drove a truck. Okay. Okay. If in the 1400s, there was a milkman that got teleported
[8099.16s -> 8104.44s]  back in the milkman uniform with milk in a thing and had the milkman truck, would he also be like
[8104.44s -> 8109.40s]  killed and banished? Would they, you know, like the, like I'm delivering the milk today. Like,
[8109.40s -> 8113.32s]  hello, good morning, Mrs. Stevenson. Like would they get, would that guy be like scary?
[8114.04s -> 8136.97s]  I want level 134. They would a hundred percent kill him. Oh, good day. How are you? Oh, Mrs.
[8136.97s -> 8143.02s]  Stevenson. Here it is. Fresh milk. Get him. Like what would they, I feel like they, I don't think
[8143.02s -> 8153.19s]  they would. It was like dancing around and like moving, moving his arms, like really happily.
[8154.15s -> 8176.12s]  How many times can I revive? Clown, not a milkman. He's different. Get him. He's different.
[8176.92s -> 8187.35s]  Hello, Mrs. Stevenson. How are you? Oh, yep. Fresh milk. Get him. He's,
[8188.31s -> 8209.22s]  this thing, they grab him. We need muffins. All right. I locked some stuff, but that's enough.
[8209.22s -> 8225.37s]  The third coming of Jesus. It's a milkman. The 1500s needed the muffins. Those muffins
[8225.69s -> 8237.58s]  would have been disposed of quicker than you could have blinked your eyes. If they, if Kermit the
[8237.58s -> 8250.86s]  Frog was playing the banjo on a rock, like throw a fucking javelin at him. You know what I mean?
[8250.86s -> 8255.27s]  They would, I don't think that back in like the 1400s, 1300s, I don't think so. Wait,
[8255.27s -> 8259.67s]  they did puppet shows, didn't they? There were puppets. They did like shows and plays. Yes,
[8259.67s -> 8265.86s]  they would. That would be fine. That would be fine. They did like plays and shows and stuff.
[8265.86s -> 8274.12s]  Theater. Why would they go after, why would they do that? How far back do you have to go before,
[8274.84s -> 8281.61s]  okay, how far back do you have to go before Kermit the Frog playing a banjo on a rock would be like
[8281.61s -> 8287.14s]  terrifying and like, oh my God, what is going on over there? You have to go to 200 BC?
[8297.37s -> 8308.74s]  You'd have to go like back 2000 years ago? I don't think, I think it's a little further. I
[8308.74s -> 8315.74s]  think the cavemen, the cavemen would be scared of anything. But what was right after cavemen?
[8315.74s -> 8320.38s]  They had frogs back then, but they didn't have like muppets and puppets and like, oh hey, it's me.
[8320.38s -> 8326.60s]  They didn't do that. Ancient Greece had shadow puppets. They would do puppets. What about before
[8326.60s -> 8341.82s]  ancient Greece? When would a javelin get thrown at Kermit, like a puppet? I don't know why I care
[8341.82s -> 8345.98s]  about this. All right, I'll be right back. We're gonna, we gotta get this out of our system.
[8345.98s -> 8362.73s]  It would have to have been tens of thousands of years ago. Puppets are older than javelins, dude.
[8362.73s -> 8368.54s]  Well, like a bug of rock, like a huge boulder, like somebody would run over and just smash one
[8368.54s -> 8382.07s]  of the puppet's heads. I guess you'd have to go, yeah, yeah, it'd have to be like 200 BC or something.
[8382.07s -> 8388.38s]  But do, all right, hold on though. Wait, this is important. Do you guys don't think that a caveman
[8388.38s -> 8394.78s]  one day would be funny, like jokey and be like, and they would all be around the campfire like,
[8395.66s -> 8401.54s]  yes. I think that would be, I think that would probably happen. Like this is supposed to be you.
[8406.98s -> 8415.86s]  And the two of them were like, that definitely happened. I think that, I think it would be fine.
[8415.86s -> 8419.83s]  Who cares? All right, I'll be back in like two minutes. Gotham Knights coming up.
[8419.83s -> 8426.78s]  I'm gonna play a different character this time. After Gotham Knights, we're gonna do the deadly
[8426.78s -> 8429.85s]  night game. It's gonna be scary. I'll be right back.
