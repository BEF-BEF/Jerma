[6.46s -> 10.46s]  Why can't I tweet this? What's going on?
[10.46s -> 15.34s]  Hello, how are you? Hi. Oh, ads.
[15.34s -> 19.34s]  No, no ads today.
[19.34s -> 23.34s]  Is it Echo? Yeah, I'm in a different room.
[23.34s -> 30.63s]  It's probably really loud. Yeah, I'm streaming from my bathroom.
[30.63s -> 37.10s]  It was literally an ad. Well, I can't control that.
[37.10s -> 44.02s]  I'll talk quieter. There we go. Is that better? Bye from the hospital.
[45.02s -> 49.97s]  What a wild week it's been.
[49.97s -> 53.97s]  I will say it's been very stressful, but I'm very excited.
[53.97s -> 58.27s]  Toilet cam. What if I do that?
[58.27s -> 62.70s]  Hold on. Does this help at all? Does that change anything?
[62.70s -> 68.22s]  There's not much I can really do about it. It's probably going to be very Echo-y.
[68.22s -> 72.72s]  Did that help? Oh, shit, it did. Oh, I'll just do this then.
[72.72s -> 83.79s]  Just put the mic in your mouth. Let me change a bit there.
[83.79s -> 87.79s]  I can't tweet this for some reason. I don't know why.
[87.79s -> 91.79s]  Yeah, we're going to talk about the dollhouse. This frame is going to be very short.
[91.79s -> 95.79s]  I envision this will be live for about 20-30 minutes.
[95.79s -> 99.79s]  There's a lot of work going on behind the scenes.
[99.79s -> 103.79s]  I will tell you that this is literally the coolest fucking thing I've ever seen
[103.79s -> 107.79s]  in the 10 plus years I've been doing Twitch and YouTube.
[107.79s -> 111.79s]  I am incredibly excited. I couldn't be more excited.
[112.79s -> 116.79s]  So, it's going to be insane.
[116.79s -> 124.94s]  Let me see. Reverb. Let me see what it sounds like. I have these headphones here.
[124.94s -> 131.16s]  Well, yeah, it is pretty...
[131.16s -> 135.34s]  Well, actually, it's not that bad. You can handle it, can't you?
[135.34s -> 146.77s]  Yeah, I'm okay. I want to make that really clear first and foremost.
[146.77s -> 163.23s]  Streaming from... Yeah, I'm in my office right now.
[163.23s -> 174.29s]  Old Jerma. Do I look old?
[174.29s -> 180.69s]  Why can't I... Hold on. We're going back to the start screen.
[180.69s -> 184.69s]  You look like a podcaster. I was thinking about just eating the microphone, but I don't know.
[184.69s -> 188.69s]  This is not my mic, so I don't think I want to do that.
[188.69s -> 199.58s]  I'm trying to send a tweet. I'll go over very quickly. Sorry about the echo.
[199.58s -> 207.73s]  Not in my usual setup, as you can probably tell.
[207.73s -> 211.73s]  This stream, I really want to just kind of reiterate the dollhouse stream.
[211.73s -> 215.73s]  I announced it, then I went on Ludwig's stream and we talked about some stuff.
[215.73s -> 222.73s]  Then I had a fucking immediate medical concern that was an annoying process that I just barely finished.
[222.73s -> 227.35s]  Literally, like yesterday.
[227.35s -> 233.35s]  I'm still kind of dealing with it. I won't give you any details because I don't want anybody to be concerned about this or anything.
[233.35s -> 237.35s]  But I had a little bit of a medical problem that's completely unrelated to the other stuff.
[237.35s -> 242.35s]  Of course it happens, like a week before a big show like this.
[242.35s -> 247.04s]  It sounds like a Zoom court meeting.
[247.04s -> 256.36s]  Yeah, I guess.
[256.36s -> 260.24s]  Young man, this is not a joke.
[260.24s -> 264.89s]  Yeah, whatever. Fuck you.
[264.89s -> 270.70s]  And by the way, get some fucking padding on these walls. This is unbearable.
[270.70s -> 275.91s]  It's bugleberry.
[275.91s -> 282.58s]  Let me try to tweet. If I can't tweet it, I can't. I don't know why.
[282.58s -> 290.46s]  Talking stream. Come on, tweet.
[290.46s -> 295.83s]  There we go. That took long enough.
[295.83s -> 309.10s]  I'll come back on. Look, I'm here.
[309.10s -> 315.06s]  That's not what I wanted to click. I didn't want to click that.
[315.06s -> 319.70s]  But anyways, hello, how are you?
[319.70s -> 327.01s]  I love how there's stream start, there's face cam, there's desktop capture, there's desktop with face.
[327.01s -> 331.00s]  And then BRB. And then stream it.
[331.00s -> 335.50s]  So I probably look tired, because I kind of am.
[335.50s -> 343.16s]  Why am I in the void? Handsome?
[343.16s -> 346.16s]  Yeah, well, probably not today.
[346.16s -> 350.56s]  I'll be honest with you.
[350.56s -> 352.93s]  The mic sucks? Yeah, it does.
[352.93s -> 357.41s]  Here, let me hold onto it.
[357.41s -> 359.41s]  I feel like the price is right.
[359.41s -> 361.41s]  Does it have one of these mics?
[361.41s -> 368.23s]  Look at how fucking big this is. Hold on, ready?
[368.23s -> 378.26s]  No, that looks like I'm on a podium.
[378.26s -> 383.26s]  Yes, I'm here to accept the award for a small but cool streamer.
[383.26s -> 393.50s]  What the fuck do I care?
[393.50s -> 395.50s]  A spelling bee.
[395.50s -> 401.30s]  Okay, so let's talk about a few things. This is going to be very quick.
[401.30s -> 403.30s]  Still going through some medical shit.
[403.30s -> 407.30s]  I'm trying to get it just completely gone by this coming week,
[407.30s -> 413.30s]  because obviously a lot of shit going on here that I can't really be ill for.
[413.30s -> 416.30s]  And it's not like a cough-cough like I'm sick.
[416.30s -> 419.30s]  It's something completely different than how I'm dealing with.
[419.30s -> 422.30s]  And it's annoying, so we'll see how that plays out.
[422.30s -> 425.30s]  I feel pretty good now. I feel okay.
[425.30s -> 427.30s]  Maybe after the streams are over,
[427.30s -> 430.30s]  I will give a more in-depth detail of what I'm talking about here.
[430.30s -> 434.30s]  But it's nothing to be majorly concerned about, so don't worry.
[434.30s -> 436.86s]  The show must go on. We're going to continue.
[436.86s -> 439.86s]  And the show is going to be crazy.
[439.86s -> 443.86s]  I want to reiterate something I didn't really talk about too much,
[443.86s -> 446.10s]  is that we have special guests.
[446.10s -> 448.10s]  Ludwig is one of them.
[448.10s -> 451.10s]  We also have Kit Boga is going to be on the stream too,
[451.10s -> 456.10s]  which I only really barely leaked for 14 seconds on Ludwig's stream last week.
[456.10s -> 458.10s]  So Kit Boga is going to be there.
[458.10s -> 460.90s]  And I can't wait to do that.
[460.90s -> 463.90s]  I can't wait to just have Kit, can't wait to have Ludwig on the streams.
[463.90s -> 466.90s]  It's going to be the funnest thing I've ever done in my entire life.
[466.90s -> 471.83s]  So having a new medical problem is fucking annoying.
[471.83s -> 477.95s]  It was a testicular tortusion.
[477.95s -> 484.56s]  Does that mean that I got like a testicular contusion?
[484.56s -> 488.34s]  Yeah, I don't want to talk about it, guys.
[488.34s -> 494.34s]  I slammed my balls in a car door getting out to come to the dollhouse.
[494.34s -> 500.90s]  Anyways, Kit Boga is going to be there.
[500.90s -> 502.90s]  Ludwig is going to be there.
[502.90s -> 505.90s]  We also, I can say today, I can say this today too.
[505.90s -> 508.34s]  I want to make sure that you guys are aware of this.
[508.34s -> 513.34s]  We have a sponsor that is now going to be completely baked into the stream.
[513.34s -> 518.34s]  And it's really good because it can help pay for a shitload of stuff that's really expensive.
[518.34s -> 524.96s]  So not only Twitch, but Coinbase is also going to be helping pay for the stream.
[524.96s -> 526.96s]  They're going to be presenting the stream as well.
[526.96s -> 529.96s]  So now we got all the money we need.
[529.96s -> 532.14s]  And that's probably really, really, really loud.
[532.14s -> 535.14s]  But now we got literally all the money we need.
[535.14s -> 539.14s]  I can't fucking wait to do this show.
[539.14s -> 545.66s]  You're a stock user?
[545.66s -> 548.15s]  Bitcoin Andy.
[548.15s -> 555.15s]  Those of you that have followed this stream for a fairly long time, though, will know that I have been into cryptocurrency since like 2015.
[555.15s -> 561.46s]  So you've heard me talk about, I mean, we literally have a fucking crypto fake bald coin emote.
[561.46s -> 570.78s]  So it's cool that they wanted to actually come in and help sponsor the stream because we needed it for sure.
[570.78s -> 580.30s]  And at this stage, I wish I could just yell all these insane things that you're going to see in the next like four or five days,
[580.30s -> 584.25s]  but I can't. I can't do that.
[584.25s -> 586.25s]  I want to make this really clear again, too.
[586.25s -> 592.19s]  All of the money that's coming in from Twitch, all the money that's coming in from potentially Coinbase,
[592.19s -> 597.88s]  anything that's coming in, I'm not taking any money from.
[597.88s -> 604.88s]  It's only to make sure that we can pay for the stream and all the production staff, all the people, everybody that's coming together to do this.
[604.88s -> 608.31s]  I can't take any money. It would be impossible.
[608.31s -> 612.55s]  If I took any money from this stream, the stream wouldn't happen.
[612.55s -> 613.55s]  It just would be impossible.
[613.55s -> 618.55s]  So I want to make that really clear that this isn't like, yeah, Coinbase is coming in.
[618.55s -> 621.55s]  I'm getting a fucking bunch of money for doing it.
[621.55s -> 623.98s]  So no, that's that's not happening.
[623.98s -> 634.40s]  It's just to I'm fucking grateful, actually, because for them to kind of come in here and give us the remaining kind of funding that that we need is a huge fucking deal.
[634.40s -> 638.79s]  So this microphone is fucking freaking me out.
[638.79s -> 643.10s]  But I want to reiterate a couple of things about the extension.
[643.10s -> 645.10s]  We'll talk about that really briefly.
[645.10s -> 646.66s]  Am I in jail?
[646.66s -> 651.25s]  No, I'm wearing a Red Sox shirt.
[651.25s -> 653.87s]  I'm not like in a prison outfit.
[653.87s -> 657.14s]  Zoom call.
[657.14s -> 659.14s]  I know this looks like I'm like a fucking professor.
[659.14s -> 665.60s]  Oh, that was a that was a really weird face.
[665.60s -> 669.86s]  I'm annoyed that it was an HD prison break.
[669.86s -> 672.36s]  Yeah, I didn't do shit.
[672.36s -> 673.36s]  Let me out.
[673.36s -> 675.62s]  You're in the courthouse.
[675.62s -> 682.13s]  All Boston prisons have Red Sox jumpsuits.
[682.13s -> 685.69s]  Yeah, they let us all watch the games on TV.
[685.69s -> 691.13s]  Convicted Andy.
[691.13s -> 699.75s]  Well, it's a further back away.
[699.75s -> 700.75s]  I go the worst it is.
[700.75s -> 701.75s]  Let's see.
[701.75s -> 706.23s]  Yeah, I'll just give you like a couple of clips just for fun.
[706.23s -> 716.82s]  Ready?
[716.82s -> 717.82s]  Like, I didn't fucking do anything.
[717.82s -> 721.78s]  I didn't I didn't do anything.
[721.78s -> 733.71s]  Yep.
[733.71s -> 736.71s]  No, I'm not going to give you like no, we're not doing that anymore.
[736.71s -> 739.21s]  Mini green screen.
[739.21s -> 741.83s]  No, I don't want people to fuck with that.
[741.83s -> 742.83s]  Never mind.
[742.83s -> 743.83s]  We're not doing that anymore.
[743.83s -> 746.46s]  Life sentence Larry.
[746.46s -> 749.30s]  I can see your pores.
[749.30s -> 751.30s]  Don't don't look at me.
[751.30s -> 753.30s]  This is why I never stream with the camera.
[753.30s -> 757.30s]  This is good because like people can like see my fucking like my nose goes this way.
[757.30s -> 759.30s]  Like one of my eyes has a like red line in it.
[759.30s -> 761.30s]  And my hair is like I'm getting a little gray up here.
[761.30s -> 762.30s]  I don't want people to know this shit.
[762.30s -> 764.30s]  I'm 25 to a half of you.
[764.30s -> 768.30s]  I can't be like pushing 40 to add to you guys.
[768.30s -> 775.30s]  I have to be able to keep up the appearance of being of I have to keep up the appearance of being a 25 year old.
[775.30s -> 778.30s]  I have to pick up the appearance being a 25 year old boy.
[778.30s -> 787.56s]  It's a school assembly.
[787.56s -> 791.56s]  What a weird school assembly this would be if this is what the person was doing.
[791.56s -> 793.74s]  You kids don't understand as the principal.
[793.74s -> 795.74s]  I have to keep up appearances.
[795.74s -> 796.74s]  I have to be a 26 year old.
[796.74s -> 798.74s]  Are you guys don't you understand?
[798.74s -> 804.28s]  I know I can't be old to you pushing 40.
[804.28s -> 805.28s]  Yeah, I know.
[805.28s -> 810.08s]  Your face has too many colors.
[810.08s -> 812.92s]  No, it doesn't.
[812.92s -> 821.26s]  I mean, if you have a few extra nose hairs, but I don't think that's out of the ordinary.
[821.26s -> 827.17s]  What are you saying?
[827.17s -> 828.17s]  You're not 20.
[828.17s -> 831.37s]  No, your head is huge.
[831.37s -> 832.37s]  My head is tiny.
[832.37s -> 833.37s]  OK.
[833.37s -> 835.37s]  Here's a bit more perspective.
[835.37s -> 837.67s]  My I don't have my head is small.
[837.67s -> 839.67s]  It's because I was leaning in.
[839.67s -> 840.67s]  Do you know perspectives?
[840.67s -> 843.13s]  Come on, man.
[843.13s -> 844.13s]  OK.
[844.13s -> 855.58s]  Take your mug shot.
[855.58s -> 863.36s]  I just imagine people editing that and being like, dude, I found his fucking arrest records.
[863.36s -> 868.65s]  He's wearing the same shirt he was wearing when he streamed that time.
[868.65s -> 869.65s]  Do a side profile.
[869.65s -> 870.65s]  OK.
[870.65s -> 871.65s]  No.
[871.65s -> 872.65s]  What the fuck is the stream?
[872.65s -> 873.65s]  I don't want to do.
[873.65s -> 875.65s]  We're supposed to be talking about the dollhouse.
[875.65s -> 879.14s]  I don't want to give you guys like fucking every avenue.
[879.14s -> 881.14s]  Look what I've done to myself.
[881.14s -> 883.14s]  I gave myself like fucking a rash.
[883.14s -> 885.14s]  I just gave myself a rash on camera.
[885.14s -> 886.14s]  OK.
[886.14s -> 892.14s]  So the dollhouse is coming up on the 18th, the 20th and 20th.
[892.14s -> 893.14s]  It's three streams.
[893.14s -> 894.14s]  Not just one.
[894.14s -> 895.14s]  We're doing three streams.
[895.14s -> 897.60s]  Yes.
[897.60s -> 898.60s]  I'm going to throw up.
[898.60s -> 901.63s]  Why?
[901.63s -> 903.63s]  The extension is going to be baked into Twitch.
[903.63s -> 905.63s]  A lot of people have been asking this question.
[905.63s -> 908.63s]  I want to make sure this is very much taken care of.
[908.63s -> 910.94s]  You're in a porn mansion.
[910.94s -> 911.94s]  Just listen for a second.
[911.94s -> 913.94s]  We can get back to that in a second.
[913.94s -> 915.94s]  So the extension is baked.
[915.94s -> 917.94s]  It's actually a Twitch extension.
[917.94s -> 919.94s]  There's not going to be anything in the chat room.
[919.94s -> 922.94s]  So you're not going to be chatting and doing commands or anything.
[922.94s -> 923.94s]  No.
[923.94s -> 927.94s]  It's an extension, an elaborate extension that's baked in through Twitch.
[927.94s -> 929.94s]  So people were sick.
[929.94s -> 932.94s]  Do you want me to put something back here so people stop freaking out?
[932.94s -> 933.94s]  Like, hold on.
[933.94s -> 936.94s]  Should I have a picture of like a painting or something?
[936.94s -> 941.19s]  I don't know.
[941.19s -> 942.19s]  So we can't see chat.
[942.19s -> 943.19s]  No.
[943.19s -> 944.19s]  Chat will be available.
[944.19s -> 945.19s]  You can chat in the chat room.
[945.19s -> 949.19s]  It's just none of the actions or anything will be in the chat.
[949.19s -> 952.19s]  You'll be actually physically clicking on the screen on an extension
[952.19s -> 954.19s]  that is baked in through Twitch.
[954.19s -> 956.62s]  You need a louder mic?
[956.62s -> 960.25s]  I thought people told me to lower it because it was so annoying.
[960.25s -> 961.25s]  How's that?
[961.25s -> 962.74s]  All right.
[962.74s -> 965.69s]  Is that better?
[965.69s -> 967.69s]  I think it's going to work.
[967.69s -> 971.69s]  I believe a portion of the extension does work on mobile.
[971.69s -> 973.69s]  I think mobile does work.
[973.69s -> 978.25s]  So I don't know if every single feature is going to work on mobile,
[978.25s -> 981.25s]  but I think I probably would have to get that corrected,
[981.25s -> 985.49s]  but I believe mobile works for at least some of it.
[985.49s -> 989.29s]  The mic sucks.
[989.29s -> 990.29s]  I know.
[990.29s -> 991.29s]  There's nothing I can do about it.
[991.29s -> 994.83s]  Are you...
[994.83s -> 995.83s]  What are you...
[995.83s -> 996.83s]  Is this supposed to...
[996.83s -> 997.83s]  Oh, also really important.
[997.83s -> 1000.83s]  I want to make sure people are very clear on what you are going to be able to do
[1000.83s -> 1001.83s]  on this stream.
[1001.83s -> 1005.83s]  I've seen comments like, oh, so we can make them just like sit and zerk off
[1005.83s -> 1007.83s]  for like fucking two hours.
[1007.83s -> 1008.83s]  That's...
[1008.83s -> 1009.83s]  That's not...
[1009.83s -> 1010.83s]  No.
[1010.83s -> 1011.83s]  Why...
[1011.83s -> 1013.07s]  No.
[1013.07s -> 1014.07s]  This is a game.
[1014.07s -> 1018.07s]  This is a game where you have to play by the rules of the game, essentially, right?
[1018.07s -> 1021.07s]  You guys are going to have a lot of things to be able to do,
[1021.07s -> 1025.31s]  as if you were playing some kind of like type of simulation type games, right?
[1025.31s -> 1030.31s]  This is not a scenario where somebody just like tells me to go like zerk off
[1030.31s -> 1032.31s]  into the fridge for an hour.
[1032.31s -> 1036.31s]  So that's not how this is going to work.
[1036.31s -> 1040.68s]  You'll have a lot of shit to do, but that's not one of them.
[1040.68s -> 1042.68s]  I heard people say like, oh, can we...
[1042.68s -> 1043.92s]  Oh, okay.
[1043.92s -> 1048.92s]  So ladies and gentlemen, it has just been confirmed by Community Jake.
[1048.92s -> 1053.80s]  All features work on mobile.
[1053.80s -> 1055.80s]  Somebody was like coming in here.
[1055.80s -> 1059.06s]  I was like, shit, what happened?
[1059.06s -> 1064.31s]  So all features do work on mobile.
[1064.31s -> 1066.31s]  No pants?
[1066.31s -> 1070.18s]  Right.
[1070.18s -> 1071.18s]  Somebody just asked something.
[1071.18s -> 1074.59s]  What was it?
[1074.59s -> 1075.59s]  You're on record calling...
[1075.59s -> 1079.59s]  No, I'm not going to be on record in front of like with this like court mic.
[1079.59s -> 1080.59s]  What do you got?
[1080.59s -> 1082.60s]  You said you wanted something on the mic.
[1082.60s -> 1083.60s]  What is that?
[1083.60s -> 1091.75s]  It's just a...
[1091.75s -> 1092.93s]  That looks worse.
[1092.93s -> 1093.93s]  That looks way worse.
[1093.93s -> 1094.93s]  It's not...
[1094.93s -> 1095.93s]  That looks like...
[1095.93s -> 1100.92s]  That looks like I'm streaming from like the bottom of a dumpster.
[1100.92s -> 1103.92s]  There's this trash all down here.
[1103.92s -> 1107.06s]  And like that's like stuck on the lid.
[1107.06s -> 1113.62s]  Didn't Oscar the Grouch have like a fucking entire like civilization of the trash can, right?
[1113.62s -> 1115.79s]  You need more garbage back there.
[1115.79s -> 1118.93s]  Do a dumpster stream.
[1118.93s -> 1120.68s]  Okay.
[1120.68s -> 1121.68s]  Let's...
[1121.68s -> 1123.68s]  One thing at a time, please.
[1123.68s -> 1124.68s]  One thing at a time.
[1124.68s -> 1130.86s]  Because this stream that you're going to see in the next week, right?
[1130.86s -> 1136.54s]  We were just in chat and somebody was like, oh, hey, man, like, this would be cool.
[1136.54s -> 1138.54s]  And like, yeah, it would be cool, wouldn't it?
[1138.54s -> 1142.54s]  Oh, imagine if I like if I was in a dollhouse and you guys like controlled what I was doing
[1142.54s -> 1146.54s]  and we did like a real life like life simulator.
[1146.54s -> 1148.36s]  Ha ha ha.
[1148.36s -> 1150.11s]  Oh dear.
[1150.11s -> 1151.11s]  Oh dear.
[1151.11s -> 1152.11s]  Literally.
[1152.11s -> 1155.54s]  Big, big shit later and here we are.
[1155.54s -> 1157.54s]  So can we do one at a time?
[1157.54s -> 1160.54s]  Like I don't want to go now like contact a bunch of people and be like, okay, I'm going
[1160.54s -> 1164.54s]  to do a dumpster stream and it's going to cost this amount of money and I need to have
[1164.54s -> 1166.54s]  like a fucking whole civilization in the dumpster.
[1166.54s -> 1170.58s]  Like, you know, one thing at a time.
[1170.58s -> 1171.58s]  Are there any breaks?
[1171.58s -> 1173.26s]  Yeah.
[1173.26s -> 1175.26s]  So you guys are going to be able to buy stuff.
[1175.26s -> 1176.26s]  I want to make that clear too.
[1176.26s -> 1179.26s]  So people think, oh, we're just going to make you like be able to like take a shit like
[1179.26s -> 1180.26s]  a thousand times.
[1180.26s -> 1183.57s]  You are going to have a buy menu.
[1183.57s -> 1184.57s]  Yes.
[1184.57s -> 1188.57s]  With lots and lots and lots of options.
[1188.57s -> 1189.57s]  You will have money.
[1189.57s -> 1194.58s]  You're going to have a currency to have to deal with there.
[1194.58s -> 1199.58s]  This is not just me walking around a room without any interaction from you guys or just
[1199.58s -> 1201.58s]  simply telling me where to go.
[1201.58s -> 1205.75s]  You're going to be able to put furniture wherever the fuck you want.
[1205.75s -> 1207.75s]  It's baked into the extension.
[1207.75s -> 1212.74s]  So it's, it's not, it's not, it's not real money.
[1212.74s -> 1217.34s]  Will there be gambling?
[1217.34s -> 1219.83s]  I don't, I don't know.
[1219.83s -> 1220.83s]  I don't think so.
[1220.83s -> 1225.02s]  Not off the top of my head.
[1225.02s -> 1227.02s]  It's going to be bonkers.
[1227.02s -> 1231.86s]  I can at least say it'll be, it'll be interesting to watch.
[1231.86s -> 1232.86s]  Buy a slot machine.
[1232.86s -> 1234.86s]  I wonder, I wonder if there's anything.
[1234.86s -> 1235.86s]  I don't know.
[1235.86s -> 1237.74s]  We'll see.
[1237.74s -> 1238.74s]  Is it channel points?
[1238.74s -> 1239.74s]  No.
[1239.74s -> 1242.74s]  It is its own currency in the extension baked into the game.
[1242.74s -> 1245.70s]  Not channel points.
[1245.70s -> 1249.74s]  Is it going to be a shit pants button?
[1249.74s -> 1253.11s]  You guys are going to have to take care of me.
[1253.11s -> 1254.11s]  Let me make that clear as well.
[1254.11s -> 1258.31s]  You're going to have things that you're going to have to manage.
[1258.31s -> 1261.31s]  It's not just me walking around and like pooping.
[1261.31s -> 1265.18s]  I have quite a few needs that you're going to have to attend to.
[1265.18s -> 1269.23s]  Can you cook?
[1269.23s -> 1271.43s]  Yes.
[1271.43s -> 1274.82s]  I don't want to give too much shit away.
[1274.82s -> 1275.82s]  I really don't.
[1275.82s -> 1283.25s]  But yes, you're going to be able to do things.
[1283.25s -> 1285.90s]  He's a maniac.
[1285.90s -> 1288.54s]  Debatable.
[1288.54s -> 1289.54s]  Is there a mana bar?
[1289.54s -> 1291.54s]  No, but there's something.
[1291.54s -> 1296.78s]  There are things that need to be managed that could be potentially bar related.
[1296.78s -> 1304.94s]  How many things will be baked?
[1304.94s -> 1306.88s]  I don't know.
[1306.88s -> 1313.98s]  That's not like a fire alarm.
[1313.98s -> 1319.19s]  Can you guys hear that?
[1319.19s -> 1323.78s]  Yeah, just leave it over there for now.
[1323.78s -> 1328.68s]  There's a fucking lift over here.
[1328.68s -> 1333.16s]  I told you I'm in the dumpster.
[1333.16s -> 1342.56s]  There may or may not be a lift for some reason over here.
[1342.56s -> 1343.56s]  I don't know.
[1343.56s -> 1346.40s]  Do a recap.
[1346.40s -> 1347.64s]  Okay.
[1347.64s -> 1348.88s]  Quick recap.
[1348.88s -> 1349.88s]  Extension works on mobile.
[1349.88s -> 1350.88s]  It works on desktop.
[1350.88s -> 1351.88s]  You don't have to be nothing special.
[1351.88s -> 1353.88s]  You just have to be on Twitch.
[1353.88s -> 1357.87s]  Kitboga's going to be there.
[1357.87s -> 1358.87s]  Ludwig's going to be there.
[1358.87s -> 1365.10s]  There may even be a few others that you may or may not know.
[1365.10s -> 1370.88s]  How do we control you?
[1370.88s -> 1371.88s]  Through the extension.
[1371.88s -> 1375.38s]  The extension is going to have a menu.
[1375.38s -> 1379.38s]  We're doing this for three days, so this is something important to remember, too.
[1379.38s -> 1383.94s]  The first stream that we're doing on, I believe it's Wednesday the 18th, right?
[1383.94s -> 1384.94s]  Yeah.
[1384.94s -> 1388.30s]  The first stream is a tutorial.
[1388.30s -> 1389.30s]  It really is.
[1389.30s -> 1393.48s]  Because I want to make sure that everything works, that people know how the thing, how
[1393.48s -> 1396.48s]  the extension works, how well did it work, does anything need to be changed, tweaked.
[1396.48s -> 1398.48s]  The first stream is a tutorial.
[1398.48s -> 1401.48s]  I'm just going to say it because that's the way it is.
[1401.48s -> 1402.78s]  What are you saying?
[1402.78s -> 1407.70s]  Am I saying Joe Biden?
[1407.70s -> 1410.60s]  No.
[1410.60s -> 1411.60s]  No.
[1411.60s -> 1413.86s]  No, Joe.
[1413.86s -> 1414.86s]  No.
[1414.86s -> 1416.17s]  He's not here.
[1416.17s -> 1418.37s]  I was like, why are they saying that?
[1418.37s -> 1420.37s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[1420.37s -> 1427.97s]  But anyways, the first stream is a tutorial for everyone to learn how the extension works.
[1427.97s -> 1431.97s]  That doesn't mean it's not going to be a fun experiment, a fun stream.
[1431.97s -> 1433.97s]  It's just that's why we did three of them.
[1433.97s -> 1439.14s]  Because we want you guys to have the ability to kind of learn how it works and keep going.
[1439.14s -> 1441.14s]  Because one stream is just not going to do it.
[1441.14s -> 1447.07s]  If we did one stream or even two streams, by the time you guys figured out even how it worked,
[1447.07s -> 1448.07s]  it's like, oh, that's it.
[1448.07s -> 1449.07s]  See you later.
[1449.07s -> 1454.81s]  No, we wanted time for you guys to play around and have fun.
[1454.81s -> 1456.81s]  So there will be plenty of instructions.
[1456.81s -> 1459.81s]  There will be plenty of ways for you guys to figure out what's going on.
[1459.81s -> 1461.81s]  And we'll be doing it for three days.
[1461.81s -> 1467.10s]  How many hours?
[1467.10s -> 1468.79s]  That's a really good question.
[1468.79s -> 1471.54s]  It really depends on a few factors.
[1471.54s -> 1481.62s]  But it will be at least, each stream will be probably at least, the first stream is a tutorial.
[1481.62s -> 1485.62s]  Because remember, it's the 18th, the 20th, and 21st.
[1485.62s -> 1492.93s]  So that day, that first stream is probably going to be pretty short just to make sure things go off.
[1492.93s -> 1494.93s]  People know what they're doing.
[1494.93s -> 1495.93s]  The tutorial goes well.
[1495.93s -> 1497.93s]  We do some fun stuff.
[1497.93s -> 1501.93s]  And then we have a day to get other stuff prepared and make sure we can get it all ready.
[1501.93s -> 1506.92s]  And then day two and three are like, here we go.
[1506.92s -> 1510.92s]  And I would assume it's probably going to be at least three to six hours a day.
[1510.92s -> 1511.92s]  At least.
[1511.92s -> 1513.92s]  Probably four to six hours each stream.
[1513.92s -> 1518.31s]  So it's not going to be a two-hour stream for each one.
[1518.31s -> 1520.31s]  There will be at least four, five, six hours each.
[1520.31s -> 1526.29s]  What else is he saying here?
[1526.29s -> 1528.36s]  Is it a tutorial?
[1528.36s -> 1529.60s]  Yeah.
[1529.60s -> 1531.60s]  It's a very elaborate extension.
[1531.60s -> 1535.10s]  So it's, like I said, it's not just simply writing.
[1535.10s -> 1540.10s]  Because remember, the carnival stream had people just kind of doing inputs into the stream.
[1540.10s -> 1545.10s]  You know, like up, down, fire, up, down, left, right, like forward, forward, back, back, back, right?
[1545.10s -> 1551.40s]  This is multiple menus, multiple things to click on, multiple things to look at.
[1551.40s -> 1554.58s]  So you're going to need the time to figure out how to use it.
[1554.58s -> 1556.84s]  Ken, is it?
[1556.84s -> 1557.84s]  No.
[1557.84s -> 1561.94s]  What are you saying?
[1561.94s -> 1562.94s]  Snob Andy?
[1562.94s -> 1565.08s]  What?
[1565.08s -> 1566.08s]  Snob Andy?
[1566.08s -> 1570.52s]  Why did you call me Snob Andy?
[1570.52s -> 1572.66s]  Is that what you said?
[1572.66s -> 1573.66s]  I didn't even see it.
[1573.66s -> 1576.79s]  How many NPCs were there be?
[1576.79s -> 1588.42s]  Do I need to just confirm that there are NPCs?
[1588.42s -> 1590.87s]  I don't know.
[1590.87s -> 1591.87s]  I don't know.
[1591.87s -> 1592.87s]  It could be fucking...
[1592.87s -> 1593.87s]  You'll see.
[1593.87s -> 1597.46s]  It'll be enough.
[1597.46s -> 1598.46s]  Fuck it.
[1598.46s -> 1599.46s]  I don't know.
[1599.46s -> 1602.94s]  Fuck around and find out.
[1602.94s -> 1603.94s]  Wake me up when he plays Sly Cooper.
[1603.94s -> 1617.21s]  And I'm here to announce, ladies and gentlemen, that after the Dollhouse streams, I will...
[1617.21s -> 1619.21s]  I'm not playing Sly Cooper.
[1619.21s -> 1620.21s]  I tried to play it.
[1620.21s -> 1623.51s]  It ran like shit and I couldn't get it to work.
[1623.51s -> 1625.51s]  But I'll play it on the remastered ones.
[1625.51s -> 1628.51s]  Why am I even fucking responding to this person?
[1628.51s -> 1630.51s]  Why am I responding to this?
[1630.51s -> 1632.51s]  This has nothing to do with the stream.
[1632.51s -> 1634.51s]  Let me tell you when I'm going to play Sly Cooper.
[1634.51s -> 1637.46s]  Why am I even responding?
[1637.46s -> 1638.46s]  That person just wrote...
[1638.46s -> 1641.46s]  Why did I even reply to that person?
[1641.46s -> 1644.72s]  What am I doing?
[1644.72s -> 1645.96s]  It was like...
[1645.96s -> 1646.96s]  I don't know.
[1646.96s -> 1649.96s]  Small words work on me.
[1649.96s -> 1651.39s]  Like, sly.
[1651.39s -> 1652.39s]  That's easy.
[1652.39s -> 1653.39s]  That's an easy word.
[1653.39s -> 1654.39s]  I know that.
[1654.39s -> 1655.39s]  One, two, three.
[1655.39s -> 1656.39s]  Small words.
[1656.39s -> 1659.23s]  I see them.
[1659.23s -> 1660.23s]  And I go, okay.
[1660.23s -> 1663.65s]  What's this stream about anyways?
[1663.65s -> 1669.58s]  In offline chat four and a half years ago, we made a couple of offhand comments about
[1669.58s -> 1673.25s]  being in a simulator.
[1673.25s -> 1676.25s]  And like, what if I was in a dollhouse and you guys could control me and funny things
[1676.25s -> 1677.25s]  happened, in quotes.
[1677.25s -> 1680.32s]  And I was like, oh, that sounds like a pretty funny idea.
[1680.32s -> 1682.32s]  And then four years later, we decided to do it.
[1682.32s -> 1684.90s]  Aaron.
[1684.90s -> 1685.90s]  Fuck.
[1685.90s -> 1690.15s]  God.
[1690.15s -> 1691.15s]  Oh, my pinky.
[1691.15s -> 1696.46s]  Why don't you use that for the court session?
[1696.46s -> 1699.83s]  Uh, Mr. Albertson, are you aware of the charges?
[1699.83s -> 1703.89s]  I fucking lock him up.
[1703.89s -> 1705.89s]  Like, I guess he did it.
[1705.89s -> 1710.46s]  Comic Con panel.
[1710.46s -> 1711.46s]  All right.
[1711.46s -> 1712.46s]  Yeah.
[1712.46s -> 1717.54s]  I'll do Comic Con.
[1717.54s -> 1720.76s]  Why do they all sit like this?
[1720.76s -> 1722.06s]  What's up?
[1722.06s -> 1723.06s]  Hey, hey.
[1723.06s -> 1725.20s]  What's going on?
[1725.20s -> 1726.20s]  Is there a reason?
[1726.20s -> 1727.20s]  Does this make you look more relatable or something?
[1727.20s -> 1732.51s]  It's always like, yeah, that was a pretty sick project that we did.
[1732.51s -> 1733.51s]  We worked on it.
[1733.51s -> 1734.51s]  It was pretty cool.
[1734.51s -> 1736.69s]  Yeah, I got a couple of funny fucking stories for you.
[1736.69s -> 1738.69s]  It's like, what's this doing up here?
[1738.69s -> 1739.69s]  Why is this up here?
[1739.69s -> 1741.69s]  Put it down here and sit like this.
[1741.69s -> 1744.76s]  I don't get it.
[1744.76s -> 1749.07s]  That's not relatable.
[1749.07s -> 1752.27s]  It's because they're waiting to leave.
[1753.27s -> 1756.62s]  Well, let me put these on.
[1756.62s -> 1758.80s]  No, I'm not going to play around with any toys over here.
[1758.80s -> 1759.80s]  This is not toys.
[1759.80s -> 1763.32s]  What's the bag behind you?
[1763.32s -> 1766.82s]  It's part of a dollhouse.
[1766.82s -> 1767.82s]  Arg.
[1767.82s -> 1775.02s]  Community Jake just put it back here.
[1775.02s -> 1776.02s]  There's no arg.
[1776.02s -> 1777.02s]  I just want to make that clear.
[1777.02s -> 1779.10s]  Eat the mic.
[1779.10s -> 1780.10s]  No.
[1780.10s -> 1785.73s]  Do you have any pets that we can pet for there?
[1785.73s -> 1786.73s]  There are no pets.
[1786.73s -> 1788.10s]  There are no pets.
[1788.10s -> 1791.17s]  I want to make that clear.
[1791.17s -> 1795.61s]  He's unaware.
[1795.61s -> 1799.83s]  There's no auto DLC.
[1799.83s -> 1801.83s]  No, unfortunately, no auto DLC.
[1801.83s -> 1804.67s]  He doesn't know.
[1804.67s -> 1805.67s]  Don't say anything.
[1805.67s -> 1807.74s]  Is someone in my face?
[1807.74s -> 1808.74s]  Someone in my nose?
[1808.74s -> 1809.74s]  What's wrong with me?
[1809.74s -> 1810.74s]  What?
[1810.74s -> 1818.18s]  What the heck was wrong?
[1818.18s -> 1821.99s]  I'm going to burp and I can't turn the camera off because I don't know how.
[1821.99s -> 1823.99s]  I don't know what this is.
[1823.99s -> 1824.99s]  This is not my usual setup.
[1824.99s -> 1826.99s]  I'm going to have to lean back for a second.
[1826.99s -> 1827.99s]  Don't tell him.
[1827.99s -> 1838.38s]  Well, whatever.
[1838.38s -> 1841.38s]  I'm sure I'll read it on fucking Reddit tomorrow.
[1841.38s -> 1844.01s]  He had boogers all over his hair.
[1844.01s -> 1845.01s]  Oh, whatever.
[1845.01s -> 1846.01s]  What are the times again?
[1846.01s -> 1850.04s]  Okay, let's make that clear as well.
[1851.04s -> 1854.04s]  I just got stuck up here.
[1854.04s -> 1855.04s]  Did you see that?
[1855.04s -> 1859.04s]  So I'm going to say, no, this is in August.
[1859.04s -> 1864.04s]  So Wednesday the 18th, we're starting at 12 p.m. Pacific.
[1864.04s -> 1872.67s]  And then Friday the 20th, we are starting at 12 p.m. Pacific.
[1872.67s -> 1880.28s]  And then Saturday, we're starting at 9 a.m. Pacific because we want to be able to have
[1880.28s -> 1881.28s]  as much time as we can.
[1881.28s -> 1884.28s]  So 12, 12, 9 Pacific.
[1884.28s -> 1887.54s]  You have a wig on?
[1887.54s -> 1888.54s]  Rip it off.
[1888.54s -> 1896.85s]  Okay, I have a question for you.
[1896.85s -> 1900.79s]  What would you guys say is my good side?
[1900.79s -> 1905.06s]  This one or this one?
[1905.06s -> 1912.70s]  What's my good side?
[1912.70s -> 1918.48s]  I would say this is the bad side because my nose goes like that way.
[1918.48s -> 1922.41s]  Front-facing?
[1922.41s -> 1923.41s]  This side?
[1923.41s -> 1926.06s]  This side.
[1926.06s -> 1930.11s]  Who cares?
[1930.11s -> 1932.11s]  Like, really, who gives a shit?
[1932.11s -> 1933.11s]  What are we talking about?
[1933.11s -> 1935.11s]  You're not talking about it.
[1935.11s -> 1936.11s]  It's me talking about it.
[1936.11s -> 1937.11s]  I don't know why I am.
[1937.11s -> 1938.99s]  I didn't.
[1938.99s -> 1940.49s]  I missed.
[1940.49s -> 1947.78s]  I was looking at the preview and I was going to try to pretend to snort the mic and I went
[1947.78s -> 1948.78s]  the wrong way.
[1948.78s -> 1955.64s]  So I just looked like a fucking maniac because that would have been like, oh, he's like
[1955.64s -> 1956.64s]  sniffing the mic.
[1956.64s -> 1961.99s]  But instead, I just went like, is the Minecraft server still being developed?
[1961.99s -> 1965.99s]  Yes, it's just this was such a big project that everything else had to go on hold.
[1965.99s -> 1970.30s]  But as of next week, we'll be ready to focus on some more stuff.
[1970.30s -> 1974.46s]  How do you eat peanut butter?
[1975.46s -> 1979.46s]  50% of the time, out of the jar with a spoon with some fluff next to me.
[1979.46s -> 1983.46s]  So I do one big spoon of peanut butter and then one big spoon of fluff and let it just
[1983.46s -> 1985.46s]  mess around in my mouth and swallow it.
[1985.46s -> 1990.46s]  And then the other half is on like a piece of toast, just like spread it on toast.
[1990.46s -> 1997.36s]  And if you've never done the first one, then I don't even know how I could even explain
[1997.36s -> 1998.36s]  that to you.
[1998.36s -> 2000.36s]  It's unbelievably good.
[2000.36s -> 2001.36s]  And I'm going to die.
[2001.36s -> 2005.36s]  Guys, this is not a thing I do every day.
[2005.36s -> 2009.30s]  I don't eat like a jar of peanut butter every day.
[2009.30s -> 2014.74s]  Although I have Googled before, do you die if you eat a whole jar of peanut butter?
[2014.74s -> 2015.74s]  I've Googled that.
[2015.74s -> 2017.74s]  I actually have Googled that.
[2017.74s -> 2018.74s]  And the answer is no.
[2018.74s -> 2021.74s]  But be careful.
[2021.74s -> 2024.74s]  So yeah, I love peanut butter, though.
[2024.74s -> 2025.74s]  I think it's awesome.
[2025.74s -> 2029.80s]  Cholesterol.
[2029.80s -> 2031.80s]  Now, you don't eat a whole jar of anything.
[2031.80s -> 2037.98s]  The Google result should be, Google, what happens if you eat a whole jar of pickles?
[2037.98s -> 2038.98s]  I don't know, but don't do it.
[2038.98s -> 2039.98s]  Just eat like four.
[2039.98s -> 2043.56s]  Google, what happens if you eat a whole jar of peanut butter?
[2043.56s -> 2044.56s]  I don't know.
[2044.56s -> 2045.56s]  Probably nothing good.
[2045.56s -> 2046.56s]  Don't do it.
[2046.56s -> 2047.56s]  Just have like three or four servings.
[2047.56s -> 2049.31s]  Have like a serving.
[2049.31s -> 2051.31s]  You could say that for anything.
[2051.31s -> 2052.31s]  Literally any food product.
[2052.31s -> 2053.31s]  Just don't eat the whole thing.
[2053.31s -> 2054.31s]  Eat like one or two servings.
[2054.31s -> 2055.31s]  That's it.
[2055.31s -> 2058.41s]  Do I like cantaloupe?
[2058.41s -> 2060.16s]  No.
[2060.16s -> 2061.16s]  Sorry.
[2061.16s -> 2063.94s]  A whole, what about moderation?
[2063.94s -> 2064.94s]  Yeah.
[2064.94s -> 2065.94s]  Just do moderation.
[2065.94s -> 2067.69s]  Moderate.
[2067.69s -> 2068.69s]  Do you like bananas?
[2068.69s -> 2069.99s]  Yes.
[2069.99s -> 2070.99s]  AMA stream.
[2070.99s -> 2071.99s]  Yeah.
[2071.99s -> 2073.30s]  That's what this is.
[2073.30s -> 2077.56s]  Do you have more than one food product in your house?
[2077.56s -> 2078.93s]  Yeah.
[2078.93s -> 2080.94s]  Of course I do.
[2080.94s -> 2081.94s]  What do you think I am, dumb?
[2081.94s -> 2088.04s]  Can you guys ask dollhouse related questions?
[2088.04s -> 2092.04s]  Like what my favorite peanut butter brand is is not relevant to the dollhouse stream.
[2092.04s -> 2096.01s]  What happens if we take good care of you?
[2096.01s -> 2100.01s]  Well, then I will have probably be a more happy existence.
[2100.01s -> 2105.14s]  I mean, I'm going to have to make money somehow, right?
[2105.14s -> 2109.14s]  I'm going to have to make sure that I'm taken care of so I can perform, right?
[2109.14s -> 2117.87s]  What's my favorite Sonic character?
[2117.87s -> 2123.76s]  That's a really hard question.
[2123.76s -> 2125.76s]  Who's my favorite Sonic character?
[2125.76s -> 2134.08s]  I don't want to say Tails.
[2134.08s -> 2136.32s]  That's easy, right?
[2136.32s -> 2142.53s]  Robotnik is easy too.
[2142.53s -> 2150.63s]  Can I just say Jim Carrey?
[2150.63s -> 2152.81s]  That's my answer.
[2152.81s -> 2157.58s]  When you speak in, no, it's going to be in English.
[2157.58s -> 2164.58s]  So not going to be doing any other dialect or any language that's not English.
[2164.58s -> 2165.58s]  It's going to be in English.
[2165.58s -> 2172.58s]  We fought for a long time about if I should talk in like kind of non-existent language,
[2172.58s -> 2182.58s]  but that turned out to be something that I did not want to do for like more than 12 to 18 fucking hours.
[2182.58s -> 2183.58s]  You know what I mean?
[2183.58s -> 2187.58s]  Like if each one of these streams is like four, five, six hours long,
[2187.58s -> 2194.58s]  I'm not, I don't want to talk in like fake, not just a fake language for that long.
[2194.58s -> 2195.58s]  It would be unbearable.
[2195.58s -> 2201.22s]  So no.
[2201.22s -> 2205.95s]  What was he saying?
[2205.95s -> 2210.43s]  Are you going to do a funny accent?
[2210.43s -> 2213.91s]  Probably not.
[2213.91s -> 2215.91s]  It's just me.
[2215.91s -> 2222.46s]  I'm not going to answer specific questions about specific things that you want to see there,
[2222.46s -> 2224.46s]  or if certain objects are there, you're just going to have to see.
[2224.46s -> 2226.46s]  You're just going to have to play the game.
[2226.46s -> 2233.33s]  Hold on.
[2233.33s -> 2234.33s]  Somebody had like an interesting question.
[2234.33s -> 2235.33s]  What was it?
[2235.33s -> 2236.70s]  What did you say?
[2236.70s -> 2240.70s]  Do we get to do a character customizer?
[2240.70s -> 2252.93s]  I just keep touching my fucking mouth.
[2252.93s -> 2255.36s]  Is there a character customizer?
[2255.36s -> 2260.61s]  I really am at like a court session.
[2260.61s -> 2264.17s]  I'm not going to answer that question, Your Honor.
[2264.17s -> 2266.37s]  Okay.
[2266.37s -> 2267.37s]  All right.
[2267.37s -> 2268.37s]  So that means you did it.
[2268.37s -> 2270.37s]  I'm just not going to answer that question.
[2270.37s -> 2272.37s]  I don't think I need to answer that question.
[2272.37s -> 2275.37s]  If there will or will not be character customization.
[2275.37s -> 2277.37s]  I don't think I have to answer that, Your Honor.
[2277.37s -> 2279.37s]  I keep fucking touching this thing with my mouth.
[2279.37s -> 2286.79s]  The stream is so fucking vague.
[2286.79s -> 2290.79s]  It kind of has to be though, because there's a lot of surprises.
[2290.79s -> 2293.79s]  There's a lot of things that I think people don't know are going to happen.
[2293.79s -> 2297.79s]  And I'd rather not just sit here three or four days before the stream
[2297.79s -> 2301.79s]  and just tell you all the fun potential things you can do.
[2301.79s -> 2303.79s]  I'd rather you figure that out on your own.
[2303.79s -> 2309.74s]  Yes, there's a fucking, yes, there's a character creator.
[2309.74s -> 2310.74s]  Okay.
[2310.74s -> 2311.74s]  There you go.
[2311.74s -> 2312.74s]  Yes.
[2312.74s -> 2315.01s]  Yes, there is a character creator.
[2315.01s -> 2316.01s]  Yes.
[2316.01s -> 2317.01s]  That's all you're getting.
[2317.01s -> 2319.38s]  That is literally the only thing you're getting.
[2319.38s -> 2332.22s]  Can we adjust your height?
[2332.22s -> 2337.62s]  And I specifically made sure that that was something we weren't going to do.
[2337.62s -> 2339.62s]  What are the dates and times of the streams?
[2339.62s -> 2343.62s]  18th, the 18th, the 20th, and the 21st.
[2343.62s -> 2347.62s]  The 18th and the 20th, the streams will be at 12 p.m. Pacific.
[2347.62s -> 2351.62s]  The 21st stream will be at 9 a.m. Pacific.
[2351.62s -> 2357.62s]  Each stream is scheduled to go for approximately three to six hours,
[2357.62s -> 2363.94s]  depending on chat interaction and scenario play-outs.
[2363.94s -> 2364.94s]  How's your body feeling?
[2364.94s -> 2366.70s]  I'm feeling okay.
[2366.70s -> 2369.70s]  I'm still dealing with it.
[2369.70s -> 2375.38s]  I'm powering through a handful of problems right now.
[2375.38s -> 2381.07s]  I don't know what Greek god I angered in the last two or three weeks,
[2381.07s -> 2384.07s]  but a few things have just piled on here.
[2384.07s -> 2387.07s]  The last 48 hours, too.
[2387.07s -> 2391.14s]  I'm powering through as hard as I can,
[2391.14s -> 2396.14s]  and I'm on some medication to help with stuff that's happening,
[2396.14s -> 2398.14s]  and I should be good to go.
[2398.14s -> 2401.38s]  This stream is so interesting to me.
[2401.38s -> 2403.38s]  There's tons of people involved.
[2403.38s -> 2406.94s]  Tons of awesome people have worked on this,
[2406.94s -> 2409.94s]  and maybe eventually we'll do something.
[2409.94s -> 2411.94s]  Maybe after the stream is over,
[2411.94s -> 2414.94s]  we'll probably get people together to talk about it,
[2414.94s -> 2418.94s]  because it's not just me that had anything to do with this.
[2418.94s -> 2420.94s]  Yes, I was like, this is what I want,
[2420.94s -> 2421.94s]  this is what I think would be funny,
[2421.94s -> 2423.94s]  and this is what I think would be fun.
[2423.94s -> 2428.25s]  But it took a monumental amount of people
[2428.25s -> 2431.25s]  and a monumental amount of financial support
[2431.25s -> 2434.25s]  from different organizations.
[2434.25s -> 2437.25s]  I couldn't be happier with how this is turning out.
[2437.25s -> 2439.25s]  I really hope it's a lot of fun for everybody.
[2439.25s -> 2441.25s]  I'm really excited.
[2441.25s -> 2445.25s]  I hope it's as interesting and as fun as I hope it is.
[2445.25s -> 2446.25s]  And if it is, great.
[2446.25s -> 2449.25s]  If it isn't, then we tried to do something interesting, right?
[2449.25s -> 2452.25s]  But I can't see a scenario where this is not at least worth
[2452.25s -> 2455.68s]  at least watching for a little while.
[2455.68s -> 2460.67s]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of things the last few days
[2460.67s -> 2463.17s]  that I'm just so...
[2463.17s -> 2466.17s]  I'm very proud and very grateful for the people
[2466.17s -> 2468.17s]  that have been working on this project.
[2468.17s -> 2471.17s]  It's fucking unbelievable.
[2471.17s -> 2473.47s]  So I can't wait for you to see it.
[2473.47s -> 2474.47s]  I really can't.
[2474.47s -> 2478.44s]  He's going to cry.
[2478.44s -> 2483.07s]  Show your feet.
[2483.07s -> 2487.21s]  Okay, let's show our bare feet.
[2487.21s -> 2491.18s]  What are you doing here?
[2491.18s -> 2492.48s]  What?
[2492.48s -> 2499.48s]  Okay, worst phase 2021.
[2499.48s -> 2507.61s]  Who else is in the room?
[2507.61s -> 2515.18s]  Your honor.
[2515.18s -> 2516.18s]  What's happening?
[2516.18s -> 2517.74s]  Booger.
[2517.74s -> 2518.74s]  Is the echo...
[2518.74s -> 2524.95s]  I'm just in a big room, a big empty room.
[2524.95s -> 2525.95s]  Blink if you're in trouble.
[2525.95s -> 2528.95s]  I have to blink normally as a human.
[2528.95s -> 2529.95s]  I'm fine.
[2529.95s -> 2530.95s]  Nothing's wrong.
[2530.95s -> 2533.95s]  I'm blinking now because I'm literally a human that blinks.
[2533.95s -> 2535.95s]  That's how we like secrete liquid into our eyelids
[2535.95s -> 2538.95s]  to keep our eyes moisturized.
[2538.95s -> 2541.15s]  I have to blink.
[2541.15s -> 2542.15s]  I'm fine.
[2542.15s -> 2544.15s]  I am fine right now, okay?
[2544.15s -> 2547.15s]  I'm going to clip these weird images of me with an HD camera
[2547.15s -> 2549.15s]  and be like, what's wrong with him?
[2549.15s -> 2551.15s]  You're going to take that, and you're going to get like this,
[2551.15s -> 2553.15s]  and people are going to be like, is he all right?
[2553.15s -> 2554.15s]  What happened to him?
[2554.15s -> 2555.97s]  I'm fine.
[2555.97s -> 2564.01s]  So there's a lot of work still to be done.
[2564.01s -> 2567.50s]  I wanted to come in and make sure that I talk to you guys
[2567.50s -> 2569.50s]  one-on-one before the stream happened
[2569.50s -> 2571.50s]  because I wasn't able to the last week,
[2571.50s -> 2573.50s]  and I wanted to play The Sims 3,
[2573.50s -> 2575.50s]  and I have a shitload of mods on The Sims 3,
[2575.50s -> 2579.50s]  and that game is an absolute clown show ready to happen.
[2579.50s -> 2582.50s]  I'll probably do that after the Dollhouse stuff,
[2582.50s -> 2585.19s]  but I wanted to at least say hello
[2585.19s -> 2587.19s]  and explain a little more detail on stuff
[2587.19s -> 2589.19s]  and give you some more insight on it.
[2589.19s -> 2593.89s]  So I'm glad I was at least able to do this
[2593.89s -> 2595.89s]  for the period I have here.
[2595.89s -> 2597.89s]  So there's still a lot of shit to be done.
[2597.89s -> 2599.89s]  I'm going to get back to it,
[2599.89s -> 2603.89s]  and I can't wait for you to see the finished product.
[2603.89s -> 2606.89s]  Hopefully it's as interesting as I hope it is.
[2606.89s -> 2611.34s]  How much power does one person have?
[2611.34s -> 2615.34s]  One person has not power over anybody else.
[2615.34s -> 2620.34s]  It's going to be a system based off of a democracy-type system,
[2620.34s -> 2623.52s]  and there is...
[2623.52s -> 2629.33s]  Why? What?
[2629.33s -> 2631.33s]  It's baked in through Twitch.
[2631.33s -> 2637.73s]  That's pretty much how it works.
[2637.73s -> 2639.73s]  Do we get money for watching the stream?
[2639.73s -> 2642.73s]  So there's going to be a monetary system
[2642.73s -> 2644.73s]  that you guys will have to manage,
[2644.73s -> 2648.97s]  and whether that's sending me to work, right?
[2648.97s -> 2652.97s]  Whether that's managing what kind of thing you want to buy.
[2652.97s -> 2655.40s]  Where do you want to put it?
[2655.40s -> 2657.40s]  You're going to have a lot of things to worry about,
[2657.40s -> 2659.58s]  and hopefully you can work together
[2659.58s -> 2662.46s]  to have a good outcome.
[2662.46s -> 2666.46s]  Otherwise, I'm going to be in trouble.
[2666.46s -> 2672.08s]  Where will you work?
[2672.08s -> 2675.08s]  These are all things that you will be shown very shortly.
[2675.08s -> 2680.90s]  And then microtransactions.
[2680.90s -> 2682.90s]  The entire game is a microtransaction,
[2682.90s -> 2685.21s]  if you think about it.
[2685.21s -> 2687.21s]  You're going to be spending money on all kinds of stuff.
[2687.21s -> 2689.69s]  So the whole thing is a microtransaction.
[2689.69s -> 2691.86s]  But you don't have to pay for anything.
[2691.86s -> 2699.10s]  You just have to watch.
[2699.10s -> 2703.06s]  Chat's going very fast. Let me see.
[2703.06s -> 2706.06s]  Will the extension work on every web navigator?
[2706.06s -> 2710.06s]  I believe all through desktop and mobile
[2710.06s -> 2712.06s]  it's been confirmed that it will work.
[2712.06s -> 2722.35s]  What if we kill you in the tutorial?
[2722.35s -> 2726.78s]  I don't want to give you guys any ways
[2726.78s -> 2728.78s]  to make this any different than it could be.
[2728.78s -> 2731.86s]  Like, take care of me.
[2731.86s -> 2735.55s]  Take care of me.
[2735.55s -> 2737.55s]  I'm a growing boy. I'm pushing for it.
[2737.55s -> 2741.58s]  But I'm a growing boy still.
[2741.58s -> 2743.58s]  How much interaction with the outside world?
[2743.58s -> 2751.34s]  I think you mean how much interaction with other people
[2751.34s -> 2753.34s]  or things that come to the dollhouse?
[2753.34s -> 2756.03s]  Is that what you mean?
[2756.03s -> 2760.21s]  Because with you guys, I will be communicating with you
[2760.21s -> 2764.45s]  as well as potential NPCs
[2764.45s -> 2767.62s]  and people that will arrive or not arrive, right?
[2767.62s -> 2769.62s]  So there will be lots of interactions
[2769.62s -> 2773.34s]  with other people.
[2773.34s -> 2780.82s]  Will I go outside?
[2780.82s -> 2784.09s]  You fucking answered. You're my lawyer.
[2784.09s -> 2786.09s]  Stop acting like a teen. You're 35, dude.
[2786.09s -> 2788.09s]  I'm not acting like...
[2788.09s -> 2790.09s]  Me getting angry and loud is like a teen.
[2790.09s -> 2792.39s]  Like, that's not what I'm doing, Mom!
[2792.39s -> 2798.79s]  I'll be an adult.
[2798.79s -> 2800.79s]  How is it going to work with people in the chat?
[2800.79s -> 2802.79s]  The chat room is just going to be the chat room.
[2802.79s -> 2805.16s]  So you are free to just chat like you normally would.
[2805.16s -> 2807.16s]  Everything is going to be baked in through Twitch
[2807.16s -> 2809.34s]  as an extension.
[2809.34s -> 2811.34s]  So the chat's going to be free for you guys just to talk.
[2811.34s -> 2820.22s]  Will there be action?
[2820.22s -> 2825.85s]  You want to take that one?
[2825.85s -> 2827.85s]  How much bacon? I stopped touching this.
[2827.85s -> 2832.65s]  How much bacon are you allowed to eat?
[2832.65s -> 2834.65s]  Is there even a limit of how much bacon you should have?
[2834.65s -> 2842.18s]  Will there be QuickTime events?
[2842.18s -> 2845.51s]  Hey, you want some bacon, lawyer?
[2845.51s -> 2847.51s]  You want some bacon?
[2847.51s -> 2852.82s]  How will the camera work?
[2852.82s -> 2858.25s]  Just wait.
[2858.25s -> 2860.68s]  Will there be pyrotechnics?
[2860.68s -> 2862.68s]  Yeah.
[2862.68s -> 2883.98s]  I don't know.
[2883.98s -> 2886.22s]  You guys can hear the explosions, right?
[2886.22s -> 2891.59s]  Fireworks?
[2891.59s -> 2895.03s]  Good.
[2895.03s -> 2897.03s]  I am going to go.
[2897.03s -> 2900.28s]  There's a lot to do.
[2900.28s -> 2902.28s]  Will there be ragdoll physics?
[2905.46s -> 2907.46s]  What the fuck was that?
[2907.46s -> 2910.73s]  I don't want to tell you guys everything.
[2910.73s -> 2912.73s]  You're just going to have to watch.
[2912.73s -> 2918.42s]  That was such a smug asshole.
[2918.42s -> 2920.42s]  Oh, is there ragdoll physics?
[2928.31s -> 2931.83s]  Can we make you eat a jar of fluff?
[2931.83s -> 2933.83s]  Just wait.
[2933.83s -> 2937.03s]  Baked in through Twitch.
[2937.03s -> 2939.03s]  That's been the motto.
[2939.03s -> 2941.03s]  What am I trying to say?
[2941.03s -> 2944.42s]  The motto of this stream
[2944.42s -> 2946.92s]  is
[2946.92s -> 2948.92s]  it's baked in through Twitch.
[2948.92s -> 2951.80s]  But yeah, we have
[2951.80s -> 2953.80s]  Coinbase is now a presenting
[2953.80s -> 2955.80s]  sponsor on the stream.
[2955.80s -> 2957.80s]  We're able to do a lot of stuff.
[2957.80s -> 2959.80s]  I am fucking insanely
[2959.80s -> 2961.80s]  excited. I'm going to power through
[2961.80s -> 2963.80s]  some of these issues that I have
[2963.80s -> 2965.80s]  because I think it's going to be really fun.
[2965.80s -> 2967.80s]  It's going to be at least fun to do.
[2967.80s -> 2970.62s]  The next time you see this stream
[2970.62s -> 2972.62s]  live, it will be on the 18th
[2972.62s -> 2974.62s]  at 12 p.m. Pacific.
[2974.62s -> 2976.62s]  We're going to go for it.
[2976.62s -> 2978.86s]  It'll be a tutorial.
[2978.86s -> 2980.86s]  Hopefully you'll learn how to play it.
[2980.86s -> 2982.86s]  We'll see how it goes.
[2982.86s -> 2985.99s]  I'm really, really excited.
[2985.99s -> 2987.99s]  I can't wait.
[2987.99s -> 2989.99s]  I'm just going to go
[2989.99s -> 2992.23s]  and just turn the stream off.
[2992.23s -> 2994.23s]  Let me make sure this is correct.
[2994.23s -> 2996.23s]  My brain is...
[2996.23s -> 2999.56s]  I'm slowing down here.
[2999.56s -> 3001.56s]  I will see you guys Wednesday the 18th.
[3001.56s -> 3003.56s]  That's only a few days from now.
[3003.56s -> 3005.56s]  That's 12 p.m. Pacific.
[3005.56s -> 3007.56s]  It's the next time this stream is going to be live.
[3007.56s -> 3009.56s]  The extension will be there
[3009.56s -> 3012.57s]  and you can learn how to play.
[3012.57s -> 3014.57s]  See you soon. I'm very excited.
[3014.57s -> 3064.52s]  One more for the road, right?
[3064.52s -> 3066.52s]  Look at this.
