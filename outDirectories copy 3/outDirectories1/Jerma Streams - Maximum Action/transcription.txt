[0.89s -> 83.14s]  Hey, I want to grab my phone. Give me one second. All right, phone downstairs. Let me just make a
[83.14s -> 132.98s]  tweet and I'll be with you shortly. Good afternoon. Continuing our stream journey from yesterday. I
[132.98s -> 145.38s]  said I was going to play max action, maximum action today, right now. Does anyone actually
[145.38s -> 161.67s]  believe that Jerm is a real person? Anywho, I'm going to turn it on. This game is an action game.
[161.75s -> 171.21s]  Of course it is. No, no, it's a reading game. This is a second grade reading, teaching second graders
[171.21s -> 182.73s]  how to read. Imagine naming your game maximum action and it's just a reading game. I should,
[182.73s -> 196.87s]  I'm going to do that. I should do that. Where's Terraria? You're going to have to ask Mr. Star
[196.87s -> 204.46s]  that question because Terraria, his computer was broken last time I talked to him and he was like,
[205.18s -> 217.45s]  my PSU. I think I got that right. Power supply. I don't know. Maybe this weekend. We'll see what
[217.45s -> 233.16s]  he's doing. But hope you're having a good day. Let's get started. I have the game up. Now I
[233.16s -> 239.94s]  don't know how much content is in this game. I think there's probably like less than an hour or
[239.94s -> 252.09s]  two of content. So from here, we are going to play probably rollercoaster tycoon two. Michael
[252.09s -> 262.28s]  action movie. Wait, it's a movie. Michael action maximum productions. I don't know. That's just a
[262.28s -> 284.79s]  placeholder. Okay. How about, uh, just call me Mike. Movie studio name. How about, uh, does this,
[284.79s -> 295.26s]  I don't think this even matters. We don't care about this paid promotion. I've, I've, I don't
[295.26s -> 311.54s]  do those paid promotion. Uh, this is not, I'm just, that's a good, that's a good title.
[312.18s -> 343.85s]  It's like half-life characters. All right. I guess, well, you know, it's gotta be like the,
[343.85s -> 358.79s]  the German colors, right? This is gloves. Outer body. Let's go. There we go. Hello, body. Glove.
[358.79s -> 379.05s]  No, we need more blue. Change of glasses too. All right. It looks all right. Tutorial. All
[379.05s -> 382.49s]  scenes are a work in progress. Maybe missing assets, textures, or gameplay elements and not
[382.49s -> 387.77s]  representative of final product. Well, this game is about, it's kind of like a combination of what
[387.77s -> 395.11s]  I'm told is there's like Max Payne, John Wick and hotline Miami. It looked at, it was a recommendation.
[395.11s -> 405.42s]  Looked interesting. I felt this, I felt like I wanted to play it. All right. How are you, how
[405.42s -> 416.70s]  we doing? Welcome to maximum action. Press escape to pause and adjust options. Okay. Press mouse three
[416.70s -> 424.87s]  to kick. Press mouse zero to punch. Mouse one to punch. Mouse three to kick. Okay. Well, that's fun.
[427.03s -> 432.15s]  Okay. FOV 90 or next game. I think it already is.
[437.94s -> 445.66s]  Oh shit. It's not. You got me. How would you know that? How would you possibly know that? No,
[445.66s -> 451.18s]  this is no way.
[465.18s -> 474.95s]  Press R to reload. Press E to pick up weapons. Okay. Now what? What do I do? Press zero
[477.53s -> 487.62s]  to do what? Oh, I do that. Where is it not loaded? Okay. He's jumping. Press G to drop weapons.
[488.58s -> 497.72s]  You know, you could throw shit. Okay. Let me, I got to rewind that. Just put that at the other mouse.
[498.28s -> 507.64s]  That's good. Right there. Okay. Good. It's empty. All right. So now what do I go?
[512.25s -> 518.06s]  That's kind of fun. What is the TV that tells me what to do? Oh,
[519.58s -> 536.58s]  let's go. Hold left shift to slow down time. That's pretty cool. All right. Press left shift to enter
[536.82s -> 553.82s]  action time. Hold. Okay. So that's the same thing. Time moves as you shoot. Hold down
[553.82s -> 558.54s]  to slow down time. Okay. And then press it to do action time. That's what I just did.
[559.10s -> 572.09s]  Time moves when you shoot. That's not happening. Yes. The binding. Why is the binding the same?
[572.09s -> 582.57s]  Come on. Action time. Left shift. I think that's just, I think that's just what it is.
[584.76s -> 588.10s]  Yeah. Okay. Just, you just, I just tapped it. Yeah.
[590.73s -> 593.45s]  Gain action time through movement, sprinting, diving, and sliding.
[596.31s -> 598.41s]  I just headbutt that thing. All right.
[605.29s -> 613.83s]  All right. That's fun. Hold C while moving to slide. Nice. Press space while moving to dive.
[619.34s -> 622.54s]  All right. Press mouse three in the air to kick boost off of things.
[622.54s -> 642.92s]  Hold on. Damn. That's cool. All right. Press X to use the grenade launcher.
[651.08s -> 658.78s]  Okay. X to use grenade launcher. There it is. Throwing weapons, diving and kicking can break
[658.78s -> 672.07s]  glass. Good. Press use to continue. I feel like this is going to be really, really fun.
[673.03s -> 678.70s]  Okay. I don't know if that's supposed to happen. All right. Get the henchmen.
[680.58s -> 687.58s]  All right. What do I want to use? This one and this one. I don't have that many hands.
[688.30s -> 729.85s]  Let's go. All right. I got it. Great job. I did it. I got all the henchmen. All right. Let's go.
[730.49s -> 738.86s]  So let's just do the intro. Is there like, I don't think there's a story in this game.
[738.86s -> 750.74s]  All right. I'm ready. Do you have to go fast? Punch here. All right. First aid. Hold mouse
[750.74s -> 758.26s]  four to pick up props. Wait. No. Shit. I wanted to pick that up. Mouse four. No. That's kick.
[759.06s -> 781.29s]  Stop that. Okay. I got it. Can I pick the bed up? Wait. Bucket. Frash. Okay. Dive. Hold mouse
[781.29s -> 795.42s]  four to pick up props. Yeah. I know. I have to be quiet. Action recording system. When you walk
[795.42s -> 799.82s]  through the door ahead, the game will begin to record your action. Your goal is to create the
[799.82s -> 806.14s]  most action-packed take and receive the highest action score possible. You can rewatch your scene
[808.15s -> 815.98s]  once you have completed the section. Good luck. All right. Wait. I didn't go through the door yet.
[815.98s -> 875.80s]  Wait. Oh. Am I dead? What? Should I? Can I watch my movie? Where's my movie? Scene select. Other
[875.80s -> 887.58s]  modes. Other modes? Endless mode. All of us are a work in progress. Scene select. Do I have to
[887.58s -> 893.82s]  beat it before I can see it? I have to win to get the movie. All right. Fucking. That's easy. Let's
[893.82s -> 911.86s]  go. This is loud. Okay. Let's go. I gotta get good to get the movie. All right. We'll start with the
[911.86s -> 954.86s]  TV. All right. I just Dragon Ball Z'd that guy. He ain't getting up. Here we go. Action. All right.
[954.86s -> 989.40s]  And close it. Oops. Bounce. Holy shit. That's too many. I need a gun. Oh boy. Try to keep going.
[989.40s -> 999.85s]  Exit. What the fuck? I didn't have any bullets left. Okay. I'm getting it. I'm understanding it.
[999.85s -> 1044.81s]  And those are not infinite bullets. No. Stop. Get up. Why am I falling down? Let's go. Which way should I go?
[1045.53s -> 1072.22s]  Is that a baseball bat? Give me that gun. Give me. No. Give me the gun. Gun. Gun. Gun. Where's he?
[1072.22s -> 1088.60s]  This thing's empty. Stop. Give me the gun. How close do I have to be to get the gun?
[1097.16s -> 1110.12s]  Free bolts. I get it. Let's see it. Let's see if it was any good.
[1127.85s -> 1167.66s]  I keep fucking proning. Oh, I switched to press V. What's happening over there?
[1168.38s -> 1180.02s]  I did it. Let's go. Continue. I'm understanding how this is played.
[1180.02s -> 1195.51s]  Too quiet? Too quiet? What does this say? Is this mouse sensitivity? All right. I'm ready.
[1195.51s -> 1218.41s]  Scene select. Scene one. Action. No. Go back in. I had to kick this guy out the window.
[1219.61s -> 1259.38s]  I got it. You guys wanted it loud, huh? Wait. What's this? No. This way. That's gonna be good.
[1259.38s -> 1294.81s]  That's gonna be a good scene. No. I didn't want to do that. I thought it exploded. Shit. I was too
[1295.29s -> 1354.95s]  insane. Oh, God. I got destroyed. One action movie. It's a Call of Duty camper. Shit. Is he dead?
[1360.49s -> 1395.51s]  Got it. Let's go. Oh, you can go over 100 health. That's good to know.
[1396.07s -> 1438.09s]  Slide. I thought I threw that and caught it in midair. Who? Excuse me. All right. Slide. Action. Slide.
[1439.21s -> 1471.99s]  They're dead. Okay. Never mind. Let's go. Get out there. All right. Do I have bullets?
[1472.71s -> 1490.68s]  Which way do I go? Where do I go? Where do I go? Where do I go? Over here. What? Is there a boss?
[1491.40s -> 1552.10s]  Oh, God. I think it's a boss. I can't pick that up. Ow. That's so loud in my ears. Slide. Away from
[1552.10s -> 1577.93s]  the fight. I turned the sensitivity too high. I get it. Here we go. It's too loud. All right.
[1577.93s -> 1622.71s]  Let's watch the movie. All right. Even there. I'm lost. The actor doesn't even know where to go.
[1624.10s -> 1629.38s]  Uh, come on. Chaz, you really fucked it up. You missed your marks like five times.
[1630.26s -> 1689.10s]  Oh, that was so stupid. I dove on my own grenade. Here we go. Switch. This is
[1689.10s -> 1698.50s]  when I'm trying to figure out how to switch weapons. Good job, Chaz. Oh, health. It's so loud.
[1698.98s -> 1699.78s]  I have to turn it off.
[1721.91s -> 1739.06s]  That's, that's, that's something. It sure is. Coming up next is, uh, the streets. The streets
[1739.06s -> 1746.97s]  available? Yeah. I'm going to try to do something actual cool. Okay. Actually cool. I'm going to do
[1746.97s -> 1784.01s]  the, there's going to be stealth movie so far. Not bad. Nevermind. I can still do it. I think.
[1812.74s -> 1862.54s]  All right. Movie's still going. I need health. No. Whoops. Where's the gun? I lost my stealth gun.
[1863.18s -> 1897.61s]  Out of bullets. What's that? God damn it. Give it to me. I need health. Oh my God. I'm almost dead.
[1899.50s -> 1976.25s]  Oh, fuck. All right. This movie's too long. Oh, what happened? Oh my God. That guy blew up.
[1976.89s -> 2001.30s]  Good. I just pressed the button. I kind of want to do that one again. Just run and press the button.
[2016.58s -> 2042.92s]  Good shot of the wall. Oh, I double stopped that guy. I think I can get it. I can think,
[2042.92s -> 2047.00s]  I think I can slow mo run through the whole level and just jump and touch the thing.
[2048.12s -> 2068.20s]  How am I going backwards? Was that my voice? Didn't I go like, oh yeah. I screamed there,
[2068.20s -> 2085.16s]  didn't I? I'm going to try that again. I think I can do it. Ready? I just have to believe.
[2116.04s -> 2143.30s]  Jump off the wall. Jump off the wall. No. All right. Still worked. Stuck.
[2144.81s -> 2165.64s]  Somebody up top here, right? They're still chasing me. Oh, shit. Just touch the button. I did it.
[2165.64s -> 2191.51s]  Okay, good. Let's see how that one turned out. I really didn't want to shoot anyone.
[2192.15s -> 2226.28s]  Did I jump on top of the bullet? Okay. What are these edits? This is the kind of edit where
[2226.28s -> 2233.85s]  this is a flashback sequence. This is not even happening in real time. This is just,
[2233.85s -> 2239.98s]  I'm having a vision flashback sequence. What the fuck is going on? That didn't happen.
[2240.78s -> 2256.38s]  He shot me that many times. Remember that. You can die in the recording. All right. Restaurant.
[2257.77s -> 2262.09s]  Thank you PJFS for the five community subs and Chris Bach for the five community subs as well.
[2262.09s -> 2294.39s]  Here we go. Hold on. Let me see if I can be like a Mario. Oh, fuck. I'm in trouble.
[2294.39s -> 2327.35s]  Give it. Nothing in here. Oh, shit. Give me the chair. Chair. Anything. Something. Shit.
[2328.31s -> 2334.95s]  No. They're spawning it. Give me the health. Get the health, please. I jumped over it.
[2336.71s -> 2387.32s]  Fuck. Give me the shotgun. Give me the shotgun. Okay. I have two health. I gotta do this right.
[2388.04s -> 2467.88s]  Just throw a grenade out there. What? That wasn't a headshot? All right. Here we go. Damn.
[2476.68s -> 2527.13s]  Press P. Sandbox. All right. Let's go. Okay. Why did you tell me I could do that?
[2529.27s -> 2569.59s]  Let me beat the levels first. Oh, that was so loud in my ears. Get me over here. Oh,
[2569.59s -> 2589.26s]  just throw a grenade. No, don't throw it. Win your trajectory. All right. Let me relax for a second.
[2599.46s -> 2608.54s]  What the fuck was that? Was it a grenade that he throw? I didn't know they could throw grenades.
[2635.14s -> 2650.18s]  I can do that shit too. I got it. That's going to be a good scene. All right. I got 86 health.
[2650.18s -> 2664.47s]  Here we go. This is it. Where did they go? What? Why are they not there? I just blew up the fucking
[2664.47s -> 2693.77s]  health. Oh, my God. Give me a break. Get in there. Where's the guy with the laser? There's a guy
[2693.77s -> 2725.98s]  with the laser. Laser. Where's the guy with the laser? Why? That just hurt. All right. I made it.
[2728.33s -> 2740.14s]  Watch this funny thing at the end. No. I wanted to watch the... I can just do better this time.
[2740.86s -> 2805.85s]  No, I did it again. Damn it. Okay. I'm fine. What? He can shoot through walls. All right. I got to...
[2805.85s -> 2813.96s]  This is the big scene at the end here. Big finish. How do I want to... Grenade off the wall.
[2830.70s -> 2857.45s]  Got it. Let's watch the movie. Did I just drop the gun? Oh, I dropped the gun. I'll pick up another
[2857.45s -> 2883.69s]  one. Press V. V. Why do you want this angle? This angle sucks. You can't see anything.
[2885.75s -> 2894.73s]  It's just this guy. There's nothing here. What an intense action movie this is. All right, guys.
[2903.85s -> 2919.42s]  No, it's not free cam. I can't move around. How do you move around? I'm stuck here. Arrow keys?
[2921.78s -> 2936.41s]  No, it's not the arrow keys. I didn't even do anything.
[2942.63s -> 2956.60s]  Number pad? No, it's not the number pad. Press P. All right. We'll do... Let me go through each
[2956.60s -> 2972.44s]  level first. All right. Jungle. I'm going to make this one worth watching. Ready? 30 bullets in
[2972.44s -> 3020.74s]  each one. Get down. Catch it. Catch it. I think I just... Did I shoot myself? I think I just
[3020.74s -> 3055.32s]  shot myself in the back of the head. What just blew up behind me? Who's shooting this?
[3057.69s -> 3073.93s]  Okay. I need health. Health is over here. Oh, my God. Okay. Don't... I don't want to... I can't
[3073.93s -> 3083.96s]  fuck this up. I got to... Does this have any more? Look, this has 60 rounds. Why does this have so...
[3083.96s -> 3087.21s]  Look at all this. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3088.57s -> 3119.40s]  Where do I go from here? Health? Whoa. Somebody else is firing. Do a rocket jump. No. I'll die
[3119.40s -> 3127.85s]  instantly. I got to jump up and hit this guy. I just snuck it over. Just barely snuck it over.
[3127.85s -> 3158.65s]  Okay. Hold on. Fuck. Oh, shit. He's here. Exit. I did it. Oh, he has a rocket launcher. Get rid
[3158.65s -> 3175.67s]  of his rocket launcher first. All right. I got it. Minimal action. Can I time it? Can I shoot one
[3175.67s -> 3193.69s]  in the air? Is this going to come back down? I don't think so. Like five hands. You had the
[3193.69s -> 3239.54s]  worst rocket jump of all the TF2 YouTubers. I don't... All right. Who cares? Where am I?
[3239.54s -> 3249.18s]  Oh, my God. Why are there rocket launchers over here? You're rubbing your butt on the ground like
[3249.18s -> 3264.22s]  a dog. Look at this hesitation. Because I know I would blow myself up in a second with this thing.
[3266.78s -> 3295.99s]  Complete fear. What? Oh, yeah. Wait, did I hit a guy from across the map?
[3298.86s -> 3314.28s]  I think I hit a guy direct across the map. Did that happen? Hold on a minute. Let's take a look
[3314.28s -> 3349.54s]  at that again. I love this. I love this stupid action movie movie. It's so janky. This is the
[3349.54s -> 3357.13s]  third game you've played in a row where you're making a movie. Well, I mean, I went fishing
[3357.13s -> 3368.95s]  yesterday. I didn't know that this had this. I thought it was just an action game. This makes
[3368.95s -> 3383.18s]  it so much more interesting for me. All right. Pay attention here. So I jump. I think I... Do I
[3383.18s -> 3391.27s]  shoot somebody accidentally? Oh, no. Okay. I was aiming for that guy, I guess. It was a different
[3391.27s -> 3410.90s]  cut last time. The audio is breaking. Maximum coward is what somebody said. Okay. This is fun.
[3410.90s -> 3425.96s]  All right. Let's go back to the room. Get this saloon. All right. Now I'm going to do a cowboy
[3425.96s -> 3456.47s]  movie here. Single action. Why is that guy still standing up? Get this fucking door out of here.
[3456.47s -> 3502.71s]  What? Was he shooting me on the ground? Double kick that guy. Who's next?
[3505.46s -> 3528.49s]  Give me that one. Good catch. Fourth arm. Wait. Hold on a second. That'll be a really long gun.
[3529.53s -> 3549.90s]  Okay. Wait. Wait. Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. Okay. Time out. All
[3549.90s -> 3564.33s]  right. Oh shit. That was loud. I need to get rid of this. Get... No. Get rid of this. That's not
[3564.41s -> 3571.69s]  Maximum coward. It's called I need to have... Get rid of one of these. Oh shit. No. Get rid of this.
[3579.19s -> 3583.59s]  Somebody has their arms behind me. Like whose line is it anyways?
[3588.71s -> 3593.27s]  I'm not a coward. I just don't want to die here. Okay. Here we go.
[3599.21s -> 3616.52s]  I'm just slowly falling down the stairs. All right. I got lots of ammo in this thing.
[3616.92s -> 3656.49s]  What the fuck? How many times do you have to shoot a guy in the fucking face? Oh my god. I shot
[3656.49s -> 3709.62s]  that guy like four times. I shot that guy like three times in the face. What's with the doors?
[3716.01s -> 3790.47s]  That's impossible. Oh fuck. This one's hard. Oh shit. Do I have a gun? That guy's got a gun.
[3790.47s -> 3807.66s]  That guy has a gun. That's who shot me last time. No. Don't. If I can hit once, I'm dead.
[3826.47s -> 3868.97s]  Dead. Oh my god. Throw a grenade up there. No. Please. Are they dead? All right. Get me up there.
[3868.97s -> 3998.79s]  Okay. Go. No. Am I... I'm not even staying. I'm about to just... I can't do it. Jesus. Here we go.
[3998.79s -> 4009.86s]  The camera doesn't know where it wants to be. You can see how... You can see how upset I was
[4009.86s -> 4014.97s]  right here. Like I have to do this again. I was really, really trying right here.
[4029.96s -> 4049.86s]  The hell am I... I didn't do that. I did not do that. That was added in. Damn it. Oh shit. I'm gonna
[4049.86s -> 4085.40s]  run. Got him. I wish it captured the voice too. You can just hear me. What was going on here?
[4086.76s -> 4109.10s]  Oh, the guy had a gun, right? Camera. Yeah, I had two HP.
[4109.10s -> 4130.62s]  Why did I let... What? Why did I drop the gun? I didn't let go of the gun?
[4136.46s -> 4147.03s]  What am I doing? Waving at them? That guy just landed on his head. I am so confused. I am
[4147.03s -> 4165.61s]  telepathically beating these people up with my fists. Okay. This makes no sense. Yeah, this is
[4165.61s -> 4200.55s]  my favorite scene in the movie. Stop looking down. You know you're having a real problem when
[4200.55s -> 4223.78s]  you're looking straight at your feet. This time more with feeling. Oh yeah, I'm trying to jump
[4223.78s -> 4243.03s]  off the walls now, I think. Nope. Just trying to get leverage from the bar. Oh yeah, this is
[4243.03s -> 4303.11s]  crouch jump. Crouch jump. Crouch jump wasn't doing it either. That was a great movie. Yes, fantastic.
[4310.07s -> 4352.49s]  Uh, arctic. I'm gonna try to get only headshots. Oh, that's a grenade. It's an enough a grenade.
[4353.05s -> 4388.20s]  Okay, we're good. He walked over to it. Oh my god. I mean, that was very clearly...
[4392.30s -> 4414.58s]  That was a headshot. It was. I mean, health. Is it health back here? Something blew up.
[4416.70s -> 4476.62s]  Oh, fuck. That is ultimate panic. Is that it? I think that's it. Oh, no. Yeah, I don't like how
[4476.62s -> 4529.45s]  quiet this is. I can hit once I'm dead. Health? Anywhere? I'm almost out of ammo. I think this
[4529.45s -> 4551.91s]  ammo... this health right there. Is he dead? Yes. Got it. Oh shit. I want the one with the ammo.
[4551.91s -> 4607.66s]  What's in there? Double health. Oh yeah. Do I have to go down? Did I open it? Can I just get down there
[4607.66s -> 4651.46s]  from here? I think this is the action shot where I jump all the way down. Got it. Bingo. That's gonna
[4651.46s -> 4668.04s]  be a good one. That was a first try scenario. What is this? Oh, I thought... right, I was... oh,
[4668.04s -> 4705.56s]  headshots only, I remember. That was so violent. I love when you dive backwards. You just stick
[4705.56s -> 4717.02s]  your legs up. That's... that's all a dive is, is you just fold your legs back. Did I die? That's
[4717.10s -> 4750.04s]  like a... oh, you got me. No, he's still alive. Just trying to make it look interesting.
[4762.23s -> 4781.58s]  I had two HP this whole time. I wonder if that door doesn't open. Give me this. No, that one
[4781.58s -> 4792.34s]  doesn't open either. I guess we're gonna go this way. You can just feel the internal monologue.
[4792.34s -> 4811.06s]  Why would the camera be in the ground pointing up? You'd think you'd just want like have a static.
[4811.70s -> 4826.78s]  Oh, that guy got a few shots. Not a whole lot.
[4854.92s -> 4863.54s]  I just took one right in the throat. That was like right into my... right into my jugular.
[4866.09s -> 4892.10s]  I need to play dubstep. See, this is the point. I remember right here.
[4893.06s -> 4894.90s]  This is the point where everyone was screaming blind.
[4894.90s -> 4905.69s]  Blind. Blind. Blind. Turn around. Turn around. You are so dumb. You missed it. Blind. Wait,
[4905.69s -> 4917.78s]  no. What is it? Over here. Oh, sorry. Can you hear the sound? Those little...
[4921.34s -> 4933.18s]  audios compressing into itself. What are you showing me? Oh, I'm trying to... yeah, right.
[4933.18s -> 4937.38s]  I was trying to jump over. Now that was a good shot. I wish they stayed on it.
[4947.90s -> 4958.81s]  That's not what happened. I landed with such explosive ferocity. That's the end of that one.
[4965.94s -> 4971.14s]  All right, we have rooftop. I think that's the last one until I'm gonna just do...
[4972.10s -> 4975.94s]  I'm gonna make my... I'm gonna just go into the editor and like mess around.
[4977.43s -> 5036.68s]  Rooftop. Okay, at least it worked. Where's this gun? Where's this guy's gun? Did I get him? I
[5036.68s -> 5060.65s]  don't... I don't even know if I got him. Where are the guns? All right, did... do not drop it.
[5060.65s -> 5084.49s]  Is this guy still... Okay, they don't have any guns. I'll take that. Don't go too far.
[5085.21s -> 5161.18s]  No, don't, don't, don't, don't. That was really easy. That was really easy. Yeah!
[5163.26s -> 5190.26s]  Now where do I go? I'm just not gonna snipe this guy from really far away. Watch this.
[5211.40s -> 5236.02s]  Yeah! Adam Sandler. That's not Adam Sandler. All right, exit up there. Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[5236.74s -> 5267.96s]  Wait, no. Is that... where do I go? That way? That's where I came from. Ramp. What do I mean?
[5267.96s -> 5279.58s]  Was it ramp? Ramp? Under there. What do you mean under there? Go under there. What do you mean
[5279.58s -> 5293.70s]  under? Over here? All right, ramp. Found the ramp. Don't fall off this shit. Oh my god! Okay, I'm
[5293.70s -> 5298.97s]  fine. I didn't... I didn't think there was a gap. I just screamed really loud because this is a good
[5298.97s -> 5352.18s]  run. Up. Um, okay, there's a... lead the target. I just fucking missed. That wasn't even where I
[5352.18s -> 5377.75s]  was aiming. Am I lying down? I'm lying on my back. Why can I not hit this thing? Oh my...
[5382.57s -> 5410.55s]  Yeah! I still... how did I still get that? There's no way. Oh, I can't hit this. Nice.
[5414.41s -> 5443.66s]  Double. Print it. Really? Oh fuck, I have no... oh, I don't want to do this too far...
[5443.66s -> 5473.21s]  too much in front of my own face. No, he's getting too close. What do I do? What? Did I explode too
[5473.21s -> 5501.14s]  fast? Okay. Oh shit. Get it again. Get it again. Get it again. Get it again. Get it again. Get it
[5501.14s -> 5503.78s]  again. Get it again. Get it again. I can do it twice. I can do it twice. It's gonna be the end
[5503.78s -> 5511.32s]  of the movie right here. The end of the movie. Final scene of the movie. Here it is. I can get it.
[5511.32s -> 5537.82s]  I can get it. I can get it. I can get it. I can get it. Get out of here. I did it. It's over. That
[5537.82s -> 5563.70s]  was a six minute movie. Here we go. Let's take a look. I was trying to jump off the other side.
[5584.42s -> 5586.10s]  This is so fucking bad.
[5598.90s -> 5612.09s]  I got him. Okay, good. Am I gonna try the other modes? Oh, absolutely.
[5612.97s -> 5617.46s]  This is where I'm searching for the gun, but I can't find it.
[5624.42s -> 5631.40s]  Acid base? I can't stop this right now. I'm afraid to. I feel like if I hit escape or
[5631.40s -> 5666.92s]  something, it'll ruin everything. Play it from your phone. I can do that. Here we go.
[5716.94s -> 5782.46s]  It didn't even show it. This didn't happen. This didn't fucking happen. Why is the helicopter
[5782.46s -> 5813.64s]  still there? I'm so confused right now. Just landing and taking off. I'm picking the lid up.
[5839.82s -> 5855.16s]  That looks cool though. It does. This thing's not gonna go in to the glass that I jumped through,
[5855.16s -> 5887.75s]  right? This looks way, way worse than what I thought it was looking like when I was playing.
[5905.46s -> 5911.99s]  Now, wait a minute. This is where it happens. There's two more helicopters that come up.
[5917.59s -> 5933.75s]  Right? What is happening? I did not hit that. I did not do that.
[5934.55s -> 5986.02s]  What is going on? There's two helicopters chasing me. Why am I aiming down at the glass behind me?
[5986.98s -> 6001.74s]  Don't I fire this? Why have I not fired the rocket launcher one time? I clearly didn't
[6001.74s -> 6019.29s]  shoot it like five times. What am I firing at? I do not aim at the helicopter. Is this somebody
[6019.29s -> 6035.54s]  else's replay? I want to watch this from the first person perspective. You know what I mean?
[6037.30s -> 6054.74s]  We need to see a clear indicator of what happened. Can I fast forward? I can't. This is great. This
[6054.74s -> 6063.30s]  is the only, hold on. This is the only camera that's in this room. I can't move this anywhere else.
[6077.40s -> 6087.50s]  All right. All right. We don't have to see it again. So let's see. Other modes. All levels are
[6087.50s -> 6093.58s]  work in progress. Dojo. Canyon. Where? So there's more. Restaurant. Garage. Tutorial. Rooftops.
[6093.58s -> 6103.56s]  All right. So lobby. Dojo. Canyon. Is it endless mode? Does this have a film? This is video tape?
[6104.60s -> 6122.44s]  Oh, I died. Okay. I think I can just place enemies places, right? Yeah, this is just like a sandbox.
[6132.25s -> 6161.11s]  All right. Well, hold on. Props. Items. No. Weapons. Characters. Where did the
[6161.75s -> 6174.66s]  rocket come from? Characters. Suit guy. Can I give them something to fit in health?
[6175.54s -> 6201.48s]  The game spawns. Go right. Does it? Spawn health all over me. Go right. Oh, what do you mean go
[6201.48s -> 6215.40s]  right? Down here? I don't think I can go down there. North left. That's not even real.
[6217.14s -> 6226.70s]  No, I think this is like a little sandbox level. Nothing over here.
[6227.42s -> 6235.99s]  No. Okay. Let me do one thing. Items. First aid.
[6238.71s -> 6253.66s]  What's the max health? I mean, I think 1100 is pretty good. 1500. Whatever. Okay. Now characters.
[6257.88s -> 6300.38s]  I don't have any weapons. No clip? Thank you. Oh, fuck. I'm dead. All right. Is there anything
[6300.38s -> 6307.78s]  else that I could do? Just like the scene. Let me look at the scene creator. Create scene. Oh,
[6307.78s -> 6325.14s]  Jeremy. Okay. What do I want to name for your scene? Test. Let's just test it out.
[6329.78s -> 6336.66s]  Mouse three to rotate objects. Start recordings. Maximum action editor. Floor clone. Mouse two,
[6336.66s -> 6349.77s]  delete. Move object down. X to undo. Mouse one to move objects. Okay. Editor menu. Floor five by
[6349.85s -> 6370.86s]  five. Okay. What else can I get in here? Objects. Can I do a
[6373.91s -> 6389.13s]  snow guy? Where's the helicopter? I don't even see the crossbow. Really? That would have been
[6389.13s -> 6399.94s]  fun to use. All right. Space, move object up. Place objects. Yeah. You can pick them up and
[6399.94s -> 6411.61s]  put them down. All right. Well, I mean, that's cool if I wanted to. Why am I moving? That'd be
[6411.61s -> 6421.58s]  fun. I don't think I want to really sit here and learn it though. So I think that's it for
[6421.58s -> 6428.50s]  what about what's weapon room? Ah, now this is what I'm talking about. Okay. So you can test
[6428.50s -> 6455.19s]  it with a crossbow. I want to use the crossbow. Is it not here? Am I stupid? I think I might be
[6455.19s -> 6480.34s]  stupid. Wait. No. Damn it. Endless mode. Act one. What? What do you mean? What? Endless arena.
[6482.95s -> 6486.63s]  Armory. Endless. Why? This is a weird menu. Endless arena?
[6487.35s -> 6513.46s]  Press to begin endless mode. You will not be able to leave. This is too bright. I thought this was
[6513.46s -> 6532.18s]  a gun on the wall. This hurts my head. I need to, I want to go somewhere else. I can't, I can't look
[6532.18s -> 6552.20s]  at this. Other modes. Dusk. Everyone was saying do dusk. Let's go AK. Okay. 30 is 60. Crossbow.
[6552.20s -> 6562.14s]  Nice. Finally. It's got a red dot. You got it. It's going to use the crossbow. Press to begin
[6562.14s -> 6578.39s]  endless mode. All right. Let's go. Explain to me what is going on right now. Uh, those are my
[6578.39s -> 6620.49s]  arrows. I'm confused. All right. I can't, I can't. Let's try this again. All right. Let's go. Current
[6620.49s -> 6659.32s]  wave. Here it comes. How's that not hitting you? Oh, fuck. It did hit you. Get in the house. All
[6659.32s -> 6713.46s]  right. Wave two. I gotta, that's just stay in the house. You did, I did a better job than you.
[6713.46s -> 6747.96s]  Shit. I'm gonna die. Okay. Damn it. Well, that's cool. I wish it recorded this. Yeah. All right.
[6747.96s -> 6756.23s]  Any other modes? Endless mode. The cutting room floor. What does that mean? Endless mode. The
[6756.23s -> 6787.83s]  cutting room floor. I'm not quite sure what this does. This is a weird view. I think it just
[6787.83s -> 6810.36s]  records the whole thing. Oh, fuck. I'm out of ammo. Didn't say what it was. All right. Well,
[6810.36s -> 6840.81s]  this is another level. It's like a different area. Oh, get out of the way. Oh, you're playing old
[6840.81s -> 6845.74s]  levels that are, okay. These are not official levels anymore. Okay. I get you. So these are,
[6845.74s -> 6851.74s]  this is like the first pass of that, uh, this rooftop level. That's all right. That's cool,
[6851.74s -> 6859.85s]  though. You can still play them. All right. I'm going to pee my pants. I drank a large coffee.
[6860.57s -> 6873.16s]  Why do I always say that? Because it's, it's true. I would pee my pants if I wasn't smart.
[6874.44s -> 6889.05s]  Where's the exit? Somewhere over here. Where am I going? Am I missing something?
[6903.99s -> 6926.95s]  The TV. Look at the TV. They give you a lot of those. All right. We'll move on. What did
[6926.95s -> 6929.19s]  I say in the very beginning of the stream? That there was probably less than a couple
[6929.19s -> 6936.02s]  hours of content so far. Yeah. That's really fun though. It is. It's fun. I love when games add
[6937.35s -> 6945.40s]  a little something interesting without that movie mode. I think the movie mode makes it
[6945.40s -> 6951.16s]  huge. And if they continue to develop this and add more stuff and add more camera controls,
[6951.16s -> 6964.57s]  and I think it'll be really, really fun. Old. Yeah. Okay. All right. So what we're going to do
[6964.57s -> 6970.20s]  now, I'm going to go pee. I'm going to come back and I'm going to play a little bit of
[6970.20s -> 6981.56s]  Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. That's the plan. But no, that was fun. That was absolutely like fun,
[6981.56s -> 6987.24s]  funny, and worth playing. So I'll be right back. We'll change games. See you guys in a minute.
