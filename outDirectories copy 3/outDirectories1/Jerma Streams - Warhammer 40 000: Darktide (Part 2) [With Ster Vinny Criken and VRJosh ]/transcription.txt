[6.07s -> 15.80s]  Hey, sorry, I forgot to unmute. I've been talking. I was talking for about five minutes.
[21.77s -> 38.02s]  Typing, hold on. Just doing a little bit of typing. All right, so hello. How are you?
[38.58s -> 46.23s]  Hope everybody's doing good. Welcome to another stream. I saw you yesterday, but you know.
[47.19s -> 58.34s]  Today, Dark Tide is launched. It's on Steam right now. Sponsored to play it. I will be sponsored for
[58.34s -> 64.44s]  the stream today. Game's really fun. I'm looking forward to playing again with another group.
[65.50s -> 68.54s]  We got, who we got in this room? There's a lot of people that want to play today.
[68.54s -> 80.38s]  We might be jumping around. We've got Ster. We've got Vinny. We've got, I'm being told right now,
[80.38s -> 89.14s]  we might have another one. Hold on. Yeah, drops are enabled too. Drops are enabled.
[89.78s -> 111.40s]  We need one more apparently. Okay, that's gonna be easy enough. Yeah, should be fun. I'm playing as
[111.40s -> 119.40s]  an Ogren. If you don't know, Ogren's the big guy. The great reveal of who the fourth player is
[119.40s -> 127.96s]  gonna be is coming up here very shortly. Yeah, there was like a pool of people that were
[127.96s -> 135.70s]  potentially available today and there's just whoever's around. Did you say what?
[138.20s -> 144.94s]  I'm no, I'm not. This is sponsored stream. I'm not gonna read that. How does it feel to be
[144.94s -> 150.20s]  the resident Twitch theater kid? Well, it's resident Twitch theater adult.
[151.29s -> 167.99s]  Um, I, I'm not, I'm an older, I'm older. I'm older. That's such a little kid thing to say.
[168.95s -> 181.34s]  No, I'm, I'm older. Oh, okay. I'm not kid. Okay. All right, let's get a call with the three we know
[181.34s -> 189.30s]  are gonna be around. I got my tweet out. Thank you again to Warhammer for sponsoring the stream
[189.30s -> 194.66s]  and the last one that I did. Launch day games out four player co-op. It's on steam right now.
[195.30s -> 209.13s]  I will make a phone call. We need to make a new group then. Actually, do we? Oh, all right. We got
[209.13s -> 214.57s]  people coming. We got people coming from all over the place here. Hold on. Hold on. The final,
[214.57s -> 224.47s]  hold on. It's down to we, and we can look, we can jump around. We don't have four players. If
[224.47s -> 228.07s]  there's like six or seven people that are around, we can just, we can, we can smush up the lobbies.
[228.07s -> 239.46s]  It's fine. Let me see it. Cause we were seeing if Kraken, Kraken was around. I think Kraken was
[239.46s -> 248.09s]  around, but if Kraken is not around immediately, then we will go with another person that has just
[248.09s -> 258.62s]  DM'd me and they will not be revealed until it is time. Let's see how this plays out in the next
[258.62s -> 275.22s]  60 seconds. Connor, do I have you on steam? Oh, I just ruined it. Why am I assuming that Connor
[275.22s -> 284.70s]  is watching the stream right now? He's not, is he watching? Oh, why am I just like, oh, hey,
[284.70s -> 287.98s]  yeah, man. Uh, you watch it. Hey, what, what, what am I, do I have him on steam? He's probably
[287.98s -> 292.31s]  not even here. He, he's probably, he probably DM'd me from the bathroom or something, right?
[292.31s -> 300.23s]  He probably like DM'd me from his, his kitchen. Why am I assuming he's just here? All right,
[300.23s -> 304.68s]  but we can get, let's get in a call first and foremost because, you know, let's see how this
[304.68s -> 310.33s]  plays out. I'm just going to, we're just going to call Kraken. I'm just going to call everybody.
[310.33s -> 314.41s]  I'm calling literally this whole group. So whoever, honestly, I'm calling this whole group,
[314.41s -> 338.73s]  whoever answers answers. Let me add the people here, but yeah, should be fun. Okay. And right.
[342.78s -> 350.81s]  Is he playing a game right now? I'm just calling whoever answers answers. Let's see what happens.
[356.65s -> 367.67s]  Okay. Oh, all right. Stir has answered. Stir answered the call. You are in, you are the first
[367.67s -> 373.11s]  contestant. I, I apologize. Uh, stripping said he was going to play with you, but after yesterday
[373.11s -> 377.35s]  and he figured out you can only do like two voices. He really wasn't interested anymore.
[378.50s -> 387.06s]  Oh, well that's okay. All right. Yeah. Boy. Hello lads. Hey, there's Vinny. Oh my God. You,
[387.06s -> 394.65s]  I turned you up way too loud. Okay. Hello lad. Hey stir. How are you doing? Shut up. You're too
[394.65s -> 399.13s]  loud. Wait, was he too loud? No, you're good now. You guys, did you guys do this? Is this your first
[399.13s -> 408.46s]  introduction to stir and Vinny? Yeah. I don't know who you are. Um, no, it's okay. This is good.
[408.46s -> 414.70s]  No, I think as content creators, the best thing you can do is not know who anyone is true. Yeah.
[414.70s -> 420.86s]  Then when you meet them, it's like, oh, good. I can like forge my whole persona now. Hello. Oh,
[421.82s -> 428.34s]  tragic past. Hey, Connor answered. So Connor's the fourth. Oh, hey Connor. Hello. Nice to meet you.
[428.34s -> 435.26s]  Hi. Hello. Oh, look, everyone's here. We did it. We got a group. Oh shit. Kraken just said,
[435.26s -> 441.26s]  I'm coming. Wait, if they're coming, I can go. I can go. If you guys know, no, no, no, no, no.
[441.26s -> 449.13s]  Hey, you know, no. Hey, I did say, I did say I was calling first. It's true. You did call. I mean,
[449.13s -> 454.92s]  it's too late. All right. Well, let's just tell, let's talk right. I'm just going to be like this,
[454.92s -> 463.26s]  this guy, this guy, this guy, Connor got in the, in our DM group. This guy. All right. So Connor,
[463.26s -> 469.14s]  do I have you on steam? Uh, I think so for, for, for, uh, what's it called? The battleship. Oh,
[469.14s -> 474.36s]  that's right. That's right. Okay. So we did a war or risk. That's what it's called. So I should have
[474.36s -> 481.88s]  you. Also, Connor, I think we're following each other, but do we know each other? We know what
[481.88s -> 486.66s]  Vinny, I messaged you one time asking about your microphone. There's somebody who said nightmare
[486.66s -> 491.14s]  blood rotation. What microphone do you use? And you couldn't find like the cable. I couldn't find
[491.14s -> 495.78s]  the cable that connects to your microphone. Oh my God. How long ago was this, Connor? It's like
[495.78s -> 500.42s]  over a year ago and I still could, and I ordered a cable and it took two months to get here and it
[500.42s -> 511.42s]  was the wrong cable. Oh God. Yeah. Yeah. I understand this pain. I still have it to this day. Yep. I'll
[511.42s -> 517.21s]  hopefully I get the cable eventually. All right. So yeah, we'll, we'll cycle people in and out.
[517.21s -> 522.09s]  Uh, but just to get the, to get the ball rolling here, let's, um, so let me, I think it should,
[522.09s -> 529.94s]  I make the lobby or do you know how do you do it? Is there, is there a quick way? Oh, my character
[530.26s -> 536.49s]  sick. All right. Hold on. Let me see if I think I remember, but let me get in the game. I'll let
[536.49s -> 539.69s]  you know. I'm going to be just recording this. I didn't, I, I streamed earlier, but, uh,
[539.69s -> 544.09s]  German, thank you for the invite again, buddy. I appreciate it. Yeah. All right. So who, uh,
[544.09s -> 552.25s]  stir, I have you. So if I invite you to my strike team, you should get that. I have accepted your
[552.25s -> 558.17s]  strike team. I'm ready to strike. Okay. Now the, uh, other of you honor and Vinny, if you could
[558.25s -> 564.73s]  appear online on steam, so I could, uh, you know what I mean? Yeah, I, I would love to, but my
[564.73s -> 570.31s]  dark tide for some reason, isn't the most bizarre resolution I've ever seen. It's like one and a
[570.31s -> 575.43s]  half times my monitor. It doesn't make any sense. So I'll be in in a minute. Okay. Yeah. I'm currently
[575.43s -> 581.64s]  trying to get troubleshooting. Okay. If you want, you want just do one. You knew it was random.
[581.64s -> 587.16s]  They take a while. Do they take like 15 minutes? By the way, if you guys know that this is a
[587.16s -> 591.96s]  sponsored stream, I'm supposed to play. So wouldn't that be kind of messed up if we did it without
[591.96s -> 596.76s]  them while Kraken sat there? That's true. That would be kind of crazy.
[597.48s -> 601.64s]  Kraken, for Kraken's probably sitting there watching, going like, are you going to do one?
[601.64s -> 608.65s]  Just you and stir, huh? What the fuck is going on over there? I'll be like 60 seconds and then
[608.65s -> 616.87s]  I'll be ready to jump in. Yeah. Let's start one then. All right. Wait, what? Don't swear.
[617.83s -> 622.66s]  I'll be right there. It's okay. Look, does he take 10 minutes to get ready? Look, I'm going to,
[622.66s -> 626.14s]  let's put it up on the screen so people can see. Here we are. Hi.
[626.14s -> 630.22s]  Well, let's go over the characters, the character creator. Let's go over the characters.
[630.22s -> 635.27s]  All the lore. Oh, we're not doing that again. Top to bottom. And then we could start.
[635.27s -> 637.75s]  Actually, you know, stirred. How much do you know about 40k?
[639.43s -> 644.07s]  Well, I like every, literally everything. Do you, are you actually a fan of 40k?
[645.42s -> 649.58s]  No, I was going to start making shit up and people would just believe it if they didn't know.
[649.58s -> 652.06s]  Well, no, you shouldn't do that because I'm sponsored to play this.
[652.70s -> 656.62s]  Yeah. You can't do that for sure. I did that last time and I, yeah.
[657.34s -> 662.78s]  Okay. I was being a jerk. What level? You're 17. So you've been playing a lot. You must like it then.
[662.78s -> 666.30s]  Uh, yeah. I've been getting into it. It took me a bit. It grew on me.
[666.86s -> 670.54s]  Jeremy, you should let Criken in for now because I still got to figure out my stuff.
[670.54s -> 673.50s]  Okay. No, we'll cycle people in. So we'll get you in, Connor.
[673.50s -> 675.26s]  I'll let you know when I'm ready if I get it figured out.
[675.26s -> 678.30s]  Thanks for being available right here. No problem. You guys are fun.
[678.30s -> 680.78s]  Yeah. We'll see you in like maybe like an hour or so. We'll grab you in.
[680.78s -> 682.90s]  Sounds good. Good guy, Connor.
[682.90s -> 685.38s]  See you soon, Connor. Good guy, Connor. You know what I mean?
[685.38s -> 686.50s]  Yeah. Good guy, Connor.
[686.50s -> 690.90s]  All right. Hey, now somebody tell Criken to join. Why can't I do it?
[692.01s -> 695.13s]  He made like other plans probably. Yeah. What if he just jumped in the game?
[698.87s -> 707.32s]  Sorry. Yeah. My, all my, um, with the release, all my video settings got
[707.32s -> 711.56s]  changed. So I just had to go in and like mess with some options, but they're good now.
[711.56s -> 715.59s]  Can somebody read what Criken just wrote in the DM group?
[715.59s -> 718.71s]  He said, what is going on? And I said, we need you.
[725.96s -> 727.64s]  Can we just pretend this was like an elaborate joke?
[728.71s -> 731.54s]  Yeah. I'm on the toilet stall.
[732.82s -> 733.70s]  Okay. I can stall.
[734.50s -> 736.90s]  On the toilet stall for time.
[736.90s -> 737.78s]  Here is the Lord.
[737.78s -> 739.94s]  Oh, he's not standing on the toilet.
[739.94s -> 741.54s]  Right. You need commas.
[741.54s -> 744.42s]  That I do know is my character is prisoner.
[745.94s -> 748.98s]  My family lineage, we've all been prisoners. It's a last name.
[748.98s -> 753.96s]  There's no comma. Ladies and gentlemen.
[753.96s -> 758.55s]  Three generations back, my great grandfather said the emperor doesn't wipe.
[758.55s -> 760.95s]  And our family line's been in prison ever since.
[761.83s -> 763.43s]  That many generations? God damn.
[763.43s -> 765.35s]  Yeah. Actually, let me look. I want to look at my weapons.
[765.43s -> 770.23s]  So for those that don't know, Darktide is a four-player co-op survival game where you
[770.23s -> 773.91s]  have to fight waves and waves of incredibly dangerous enemies.
[773.91s -> 778.63s]  Those enemies can range from machine gunners to zombie-type enemies to monsters,
[779.61s -> 784.97s]  to other big, big, big things, right? And it's all about working together
[784.97s -> 789.29s]  and trying to stop. If you ever played Vermintide, obviously same company, same group.
[790.15s -> 795.93s]  And it's very fun. And I think that we should take a look at the items.
[795.93s -> 797.26s]  Well done.
[797.26s -> 798.22s]  I only have two.
[798.22s -> 804.10s]  Sir, do you have a purple? Like, do you have any purples?
[804.10s -> 805.94s]  I'll be right back once I guess.
[806.74s -> 807.69s]  Yeah.
[807.69s -> 810.65s]  What's your what's your weapon loadout look like?
[810.65s -> 815.27s]  I'm not using it. I've got this charge gun that blows people up.
[815.27s -> 819.54s]  I'm trying and an axe.
[819.54s -> 820.82s]  Ooh, that sounds pretty good.
[821.77s -> 825.82s]  You know, you can upgrade your anything to purple if you want it.
[825.82s -> 828.94s]  And I do apologize to everybody watching that the only content in the last
[829.50s -> 832.30s]  12 minutes of the stream so far has been me walking back and forth
[832.30s -> 834.62s]  down this hallway while I talk filler words.
[835.10s -> 839.88s]  I think it's been great content to tell Kraken to go away
[839.88s -> 841.64s]  and then ask him to come back.
[841.64s -> 842.84s]  Then need him. Yeah.
[842.84s -> 850.09s]  I mean, I've been doing laps around the hub.
[850.09s -> 850.57s]  Have you?
[850.57s -> 856.02s]  It feels like 20 minutes now. So I'm ready.
[856.02s -> 857.13s]  We'll be good.
[857.13s -> 857.61s]  Yeah.
[857.61s -> 859.22s]  How long has he been on the toilet?
[859.22s -> 863.06s]  So wait, was he truly ready at all then?
[863.06s -> 868.14s]  What if he what if he was on the toilet just typing like,
[868.14s -> 870.54s]  oh, what the fuck guys, I'm ready. I'm here.
[870.54s -> 872.86s]  And he's just like leaning down like this, like on the toilet.
[872.86s -> 877.83s]  He doesn't want to put on the.
[877.83s -> 883.11s]  Oh, wait, they they was a they did come out with a beta headgear, right?
[883.11s -> 883.35s]  Yeah.
[883.35s -> 887.11s]  Yeah, it just said it's a helmet that has like a beta logo on it.
[887.11s -> 889.27s]  So you can prove to everyone that you're a beta.
[889.27s -> 890.12s]  Do I have it?
[890.12s -> 891.32s]  That's why I'm wearing it.
[891.32s -> 895.50s]  Yeah, I don't even know where it is.
[895.50s -> 896.70s]  I don't know how to access it.
[896.70s -> 898.49s]  Is this do I get it?
[898.49s -> 900.18s]  Should have it.
[900.18s -> 902.26s]  You press I and go to cosmetic.
[902.26s -> 905.08s]  Well, I don't have it.
[905.08s -> 906.92s]  Is it an accessory?
[909.77s -> 910.73s]  It's a head.
[910.73s -> 912.38s]  Yeah, I don't have it either.
[912.38s -> 914.07s]  That's weird.
[914.07s -> 916.81s]  I think this is the organs.
[916.81s -> 919.05s]  Maybe you had to reach a certain level in the beta.
[920.01s -> 925.03s]  I mean, I very clearly did not have this stuff last time.
[925.03s -> 925.19s]  Yeah.
[925.19s -> 936.49s]  When I loaded in today, I got a bunch of unlocks, like a ton of cosmetics and stuff appearance.
[937.50s -> 937.66s]  Yeah.
[937.66s -> 939.58s]  Speaking of beta, the game is launched today.
[939.58s -> 940.97s]  It's official.
[940.97s -> 941.45s]  No longer.
[941.93s -> 943.29s]  It's it is it is here.
[943.29s -> 944.25s]  It's on Steam.
[944.25s -> 947.78s]  They did a bunch of updates to like for the launch.
[947.78s -> 952.34s]  So did they excited to check out all the new stuff because I've been on level eight now.
[952.34s -> 953.94s]  I really enjoyed playing this.
[953.94s -> 954.18s]  Yeah.
[954.18s -> 958.26s]  No, they added like eight new levels that you can play through.
[958.34s -> 959.14s]  New missions.
[959.14s -> 962.58s]  And there's a cosmetic store that's different than the armory.
[962.58s -> 963.06s]  That's awesome.
[963.06s -> 965.62s]  Because the more missions, the better.
[965.62s -> 967.62s]  It's just that's a lot.
[967.62s -> 969.93s]  That's good.
[969.93s -> 970.33s]  All right.
[970.33s -> 971.77s]  So it's still on the toilet.
[971.77s -> 972.49s]  Sorry, everybody.
[972.49s -> 974.65s]  Oh, let me let me get you into the lobby.
[975.37s -> 975.77s]  Yeah.
[975.77s -> 976.89s]  OK.
[976.89s -> 979.19s]  Is you are you parent online?
[979.19s -> 979.67s]  Yeah.
[979.67s -> 980.31s]  Oh, God.
[981.11s -> 981.59s]  Hang on.
[981.59s -> 982.15s]  Sorry.
[982.15s -> 983.43s]  It is it is Steam.
[983.43s -> 984.79s]  You have to tell it.
[984.79s -> 985.99s]  You have to tell everybody you're online.
[991.02s -> 992.14s]  What is your name?
[992.14s -> 993.88s]  What's your name on Steam right now?
[993.88s -> 995.08s]  Gas can.
[995.08s -> 996.52s]  No, it's just Vinesauce.
[996.52s -> 998.28s]  Oh, it's like, wait, I was like, that's me.
[1002.30s -> 1005.37s]  Says you're offline.
[1005.37s -> 1010.89s]  A lot of a lot of an animosity towards Steam every time I play games with you.
[1010.89s -> 1012.89s]  Like, are you ready to go to the Epic Games Store?
[1012.89s -> 1013.45s]  We're all ready.
[1014.26s -> 1015.38s]  I don't know about that, Star.
[1016.74s -> 1017.06s]  Bro.
[1018.98s -> 1023.70s]  OK.
[1023.70s -> 1024.58s]  So you should.
[1024.58s -> 1025.30s]  I got the invite.
[1025.30s -> 1025.54s]  Yeah.
[1025.54s -> 1026.26s]  Thank you.
[1026.26s -> 1026.50s]  All right.
[1026.50s -> 1033.34s]  Now we're just waiting for Kraikin to finish his movement, his bathroom routine, whatever it is,
[1033.34s -> 1039.58s]  and we can get started, which should be pretty soon.
[1039.58s -> 1040.14s]  Well, I don't know.
[1041.59s -> 1042.39s]  I wonder.
[1042.39s -> 1046.26s]  There's been plenty of times where I've spent quite a while.
[1046.26s -> 1049.94s]  Yeah.
[1049.94s -> 1050.10s]  What?
[1050.10s -> 1051.70s]  Should we ask how long?
[1051.70s -> 1053.94s]  How long should we stall?
[1053.94s -> 1062.73s]  I'm going to laugh my ass off if he says, like, 40 minutes.
[1062.73s -> 1064.57s]  If he just tells us what he ate, we'll know.
[1064.57s -> 1068.78s]  Like, if he says White Castle or Taco Bell, we'll know.
[1068.78s -> 1070.06s]  How long should we stall?
[1073.40s -> 1078.12s]  You know, it'd be really funny if he joined the call and flushed,
[1078.12s -> 1079.72s]  like there was a toilet flush sound.
[1079.72s -> 1083.27s]  I mean, that would be pretty good.
[1083.27s -> 1084.63s]  I should tell him to do that.
[1084.63s -> 1087.35s]  I mean, it would be funnier if he actually never came.
[1089.72s -> 1091.54s]  He's just not ever going to be here.
[1091.54s -> 1091.94s]  Yeah.
[1091.94s -> 1095.14s]  Sponsor to run around the hub world for 20 minutes.
[1095.14s -> 1095.54s]  Where?
[1095.54s -> 1097.22s]  I don't want to be playing this.
[1097.22s -> 1097.70s]  Don't worry.
[1100.65s -> 1101.85s]  He says he's hopping on now.
[1103.00s -> 1103.72s]  All right.
[1103.72s -> 1104.44s]  Yeah.
[1104.44s -> 1107.11s]  OK.
[1107.11s -> 1110.22s]  Well, hey, the last time we did this, too, we're getting ready.
[1110.22s -> 1111.98s]  Hey, sometimes you get a group of four people together.
[1111.98s -> 1113.02s]  It's actually takes some time.
[1113.74s -> 1114.30s]  Yeah.
[1114.30s -> 1115.58s]  And it took longer last time.
[1115.58s -> 1116.70s]  So this is relatively quick.
[1116.70s -> 1117.26s]  This is pretty quick.
[1117.26s -> 1121.56s]  We got this down to like a well-oiled machine like Kraikin's bowels.
[1121.56s -> 1123.16s]  Dan, if Warhammer, if you're watching this right now,
[1124.04s -> 1125.96s]  this guy's walking around in circles in the hub.
[1125.96s -> 1126.60s]  What is he doing?
[1127.53s -> 1129.53s]  We're just getting ready and we're going to be good to go.
[1130.01s -> 1136.82s]  It's actually part of the lore that you praised the emperor by walking around the ship.
[1136.82s -> 1139.11s]  Yeah, we did do this exact thing last time.
[1139.51s -> 1144.15s]  So what's what's what new mission should we do?
[1145.02s -> 1145.90s]  This new stuff, right?
[1145.90s -> 1147.27s]  What should we do?
[1147.27s -> 1151.46s]  And by the way, I know I'm a I'm a two bar Andy.
[1151.46s -> 1154.02s]  I know that a lot of you guys might be three or four bar Andes.
[1155.62s -> 1158.74s]  No, the level that you guys are at, like three bars is pretty rough.
[1158.74s -> 1159.70s]  Is it? Okay.
[1159.70s -> 1162.10s]  Because you do you do get a lot of power through levels and.
[1162.10s -> 1163.54s]  Oh, you mean the the difficulty?
[1163.54s -> 1164.90s]  Yeah, two is two is good.
[1164.90s -> 1166.02s]  I'm fine with two.
[1166.02s -> 1167.70s]  And then if you want, like maybe at the end,
[1167.70s -> 1171.30s]  we can attempt to three like when we're all like really like awesome at the game.
[1171.30s -> 1176.12s]  Well, there's also twos that have like nearly infinite hordes.
[1176.12s -> 1176.36s]  Right.
[1176.36s -> 1179.53s]  And those are also pretty tough.
[1179.53s -> 1180.70s]  Okay.
[1180.70s -> 1183.26s]  Before you get all your your levels up and whatnot.
[1183.26s -> 1187.19s]  We'll start with two and then we'll move on to three after a few matches or something.
[1187.19s -> 1189.51s]  Yeah, we can give I think maybe we'll be good.
[1189.51s -> 1191.51s]  Like we'll be like well practiced.
[1191.51s -> 1191.83s]  Yeah.
[1191.83s -> 1195.59s]  But if not, it'll be fun for the audience to watch us fail.
[1195.59s -> 1197.45s]  So what about map?
[1197.45s -> 1199.51s]  Is there any of these new?
[1199.51s -> 1203.75s]  I think the one on the bottom have Draco might be new.
[1203.75s -> 1205.66s]  I don't think that was there.
[1205.66s -> 1207.50s]  But wait, I don't know.
[1207.50s -> 1208.38s]  Is this a two star?
[1208.38s -> 1209.74s]  Wait, because they had a new mission type.
[1209.74s -> 1212.14s]  So that's investigation, which I don't think was there before.
[1212.62s -> 1215.10s]  Some of them are the maps that were already in.
[1215.10s -> 1215.82s]  But you do them.
[1216.38s -> 1219.26s]  You go to like different areas of that map and do a different mission.
[1219.26s -> 1219.74s]  Oh, okay.
[1219.74s -> 1221.42s]  Not I haven't done enough yet today.
[1221.42s -> 1224.22s]  So I don't like fully know, but that's how it's going.
[1224.22s -> 1228.07s]  Hey, hey, hey, how are you?
[1229.11s -> 1229.67s]  I'm great.
[1229.67s -> 1230.79s]  Am I allowed to be here now?
[1230.79s -> 1231.27s]  Yeah, sorry.
[1231.27s -> 1232.47s]  Yes, we invited.
[1232.47s -> 1233.51s]  I invited you.
[1233.51s -> 1234.31s]  Then we booted you.
[1234.31s -> 1237.11s]  Then I invited you again and then you were taking a bathroom break.
[1237.11s -> 1237.59s]  I'm sorry.
[1237.59s -> 1238.15s]  That's my fault.
[1238.15s -> 1238.47s]  That's all.
[1238.47s -> 1239.83s]  It's actually all my fault.
[1239.83s -> 1243.67s]  It was I thought I, you know, I invited too many people to the party
[1243.67s -> 1245.03s]  and then like too many people said yes.
[1245.03s -> 1246.87s]  You all sort of said maybe on Facebook.
[1246.87s -> 1249.06s]  Like that's you know what I mean?
[1249.06s -> 1251.82s]  Yeah, you guys should have all clicked.
[1251.82s -> 1253.02s]  Maybe on Facebook instead of.
[1253.50s -> 1255.42s]  Still organizes all of his streams on Facebook
[1255.42s -> 1258.94s]  and we're asking begging him, please, please any other platform, man.
[1258.94s -> 1260.54s]  But he just he's addicted to that.
[1260.54s -> 1262.54s]  Maybe you know that will they show up?
[1262.54s -> 1263.26s]  I don't know.
[1263.26s -> 1264.46s]  All right, let's let's get you in here.
[1264.46s -> 1265.02s]  It's exciting.
[1265.90s -> 1267.42s]  This is actually that get the fuck in here.
[1267.42s -> 1270.38s]  This is actually pretty great because this is this is a team of players
[1270.38s -> 1271.82s]  that know what they're doing besides me.
[1271.82s -> 1272.62s]  So this is going to be great.
[1273.42s -> 1275.34s]  I mean, you're level seven, you know.
[1275.34s -> 1280.79s]  I got carried by literally by criken and yeah, that that criken and stripping
[1280.79s -> 1286.14s]  literally carried as I was even when we almost beat a five a couple days ago.
[1287.61s -> 1288.73s]  Are you online?
[1289.69s -> 1290.81s]  Yeah, I'm logging in now.
[1290.81s -> 1292.02s]  There you are.
[1292.02s -> 1294.02s]  But we'll be doing that later tonight.
[1294.02s -> 1296.74s]  I think we're going to try to go for broke.
[1296.74s -> 1297.14s]  I was.
[1297.14s -> 1300.50s]  Yeah, I was going to play this with a couple of my my mods today.
[1300.50s -> 1302.41s]  So this ended up working out.
[1302.41s -> 1304.01s]  I was going to check out the new stuff.
[1304.73s -> 1307.05s]  Criken, do you know which map for sure is new?
[1307.05s -> 1311.30s]  Because we're looking at the missions have Draco seems new to us.
[1312.18s -> 1313.14s]  That one wasn't new.
[1313.14s -> 1315.70s]  There was one up top that wasn't it just rotated out.
[1315.70s -> 1317.50s]  Oh, darn.
[1317.50s -> 1318.78s]  OK, there you are.
[1318.78s -> 1320.46s]  And if I do, I can't invite you.
[1320.46s -> 1322.94s]  All right.
[1322.94s -> 1324.62s]  I'm just going to cold open my stream.
[1324.62s -> 1327.00s]  One sec, man.
[1328.01s -> 1330.01s]  Dave, I promise we'll play this eventually.
[1333.62s -> 1334.18s]  This is the war.
[1334.18s -> 1334.98s]  This is OK.
[1334.98s -> 1338.18s]  You know, before a big theater production, all you guys are theater kids.
[1338.18s -> 1340.26s]  Like I was like, you know, we are like I am.
[1340.26s -> 1344.18s]  So, so before a show, we all sit around and we go like.
[1347.08s -> 1350.28s]  La la la la la la la la la la la la.
[1350.28s -> 1350.52s]  Right.
[1350.52s -> 1352.68s]  So and everybody just gets warmed up vocally.
[1352.68s -> 1355.75s]  So then we're ready to go.
[1355.75s -> 1360.23s]  OK, that sounded kind of like the Peewee Herman's big adventure theme.
[1360.23s -> 1363.34s]  Jerma, that was a cult.
[1371.29s -> 1372.81s]  No, it wasn't.
[1375.75s -> 1376.71s]  It literally was.
[1376.71s -> 1378.15s]  It was not it.
[1378.15s -> 1379.75s]  No, it's what are you talking about?
[1379.75s -> 1389.64s]  All right, let's see if I can get criken in here.
[1389.64s -> 1390.12s]  All right.
[1391.22s -> 1393.38s]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for us to.
[1393.38s -> 1398.10s]  Hey, look, a lot of streamers have like 15 to 20 minute countdowns on their stream.
[1398.18s -> 1398.90s]  We haven't even started yet.
[1398.90s -> 1399.70s]  The stream hasn't even started.
[1399.70s -> 1401.18s]  We haven't begun yet.
[1401.18s -> 1409.93s]  Yeah.
[1409.93s -> 1411.45s]  Yeah, I was a public access guy.
[1411.45s -> 1415.83s]  I wasn't a theater guy, so we didn't really like warm up or anything.
[1416.86s -> 1419.10s]  We just made terrible television with no warm up.
[1420.30s -> 1429.69s]  What in German, German, whatever, whatever.
[1429.69s -> 1430.58s]  Yeah.
[1430.58s -> 1432.42s]  So, sir, how was your day since yesterday?
[1433.46s -> 1438.02s]  My day since yesterday, I've really just, you know, been having an amazing time living
[1438.02s -> 1440.02s]  like the most crazy life ever.
[1440.02s -> 1441.62s]  I'm gaming on a yacht right now.
[1441.62s -> 1442.58s]  I'm right off the back.
[1442.58s -> 1446.10s]  I can see the amazing Seattle Vista Skyline.
[1446.10s -> 1448.57s]  Oh, what the fuck is going on in my game?
[1448.57s -> 1450.41s]  Yeah, I think we're once this mission starts,
[1450.41s -> 1452.41s]  I'm going to hop in the helicopter and game from there.
[1452.41s -> 1453.05s]  All right.
[1453.05s -> 1456.17s]  So I'm getting a million items added to my thing.
[1456.17s -> 1456.73s]  Me too.
[1457.69s -> 1459.37s]  And video settings got reset, too.
[1459.37s -> 1462.41s]  I don't know if that happened to you, but just double check that you're all good.
[1462.41s -> 1464.92s]  OK.
[1464.92s -> 1465.88s]  Yeah, I hit level 30.
[1465.88s -> 1468.20s]  So it was like, oh, yeah, here's the rest of the game.
[1468.20s -> 1469.80s]  And they just updated it all at once.
[1469.80s -> 1470.36s]  Yeah.
[1470.36s -> 1478.87s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Warhammer Darktide launch event.
[1478.87s -> 1480.15s]  It's here.
[1480.15s -> 1481.43s]  It's on Steam.
[1481.43s -> 1483.35s]  And I'm ready to queue us up.
[1483.35s -> 1486.78s]  So that was that was sick.
[1487.58s -> 1490.06s]  I'd ask to do that again, but I think you nailed it first.
[1490.06s -> 1491.10s]  Yo, what is up, guys?
[1491.10s -> 1492.86s]  This is episode number two of Darktide.
[1492.86s -> 1493.66s]  Stop, stop.
[1495.51s -> 1496.87s]  OK, so we'll be here.
[1496.87s -> 1499.43s]  You just inspired me to sub to Jerma with that voice.
[1499.43s -> 1500.15s]  Thanks.
[1500.15s -> 1500.74s]  All right.
[1500.74s -> 1502.90s]  So what are we cracking?
[1503.22s -> 1505.14s]  We ask you because you're level 30.
[1505.14s -> 1505.38s]  Damn.
[1506.87s -> 1507.51s]  Yeah.
[1507.51s -> 1509.19s]  Where should we go right now?
[1509.19s -> 1512.71s]  Where should we what should we do to experience the launch of the video game, you would say?
[1512.71s -> 1513.51s]  Let's see.
[1513.51s -> 1514.23s]  Is there some new stuff?
[1514.23s -> 1515.03s]  There's a few new areas.
[1515.03s -> 1515.59s]  Yes.
[1515.59s -> 1518.44s]  Refinery Delta 17 is new.
[1518.44s -> 1520.76s]  Vigil station oblivion is new.
[1522.89s -> 1524.97s]  Let's do the Vigil station and the five.
[1524.97s -> 1528.17s]  Let's do the three Vigil station oblivion three.
[1528.17s -> 1529.53s]  We'll start here, you know.
[1529.53s -> 1533.29s]  Oh, let's go to fives at the end of the day.
[1533.77s -> 1535.78s]  Oh, OK.
[1535.78s -> 1537.78s]  I'm I'm I'm actually really pumped.
[1537.78s -> 1538.89s]  Heck up.
[1538.89s -> 1540.57s]  I did a five a few nights ago.
[1540.57s -> 1549.43s]  It was like me, GMart stripping and I was the last one I forgot.
[1549.43s -> 1554.55s]  But we we got all the way to the final objective and like like four out of five.
[1554.55s -> 1559.19s]  And it was an absolute like it was so difficult, but so fun.
[1559.19s -> 1560.55s]  I really, really like it.
[1560.55s -> 1561.35s]  So what was the whole thing?
[1562.79s -> 1564.79s]  Five is like impossible right now, right?
[1564.79s -> 1566.63s]  Five is like insanely hard.
[1566.63s -> 1567.75s]  It's it's super hard.
[1567.75s -> 1571.11s]  It's because there's no limit to how many specials can spawn at a time.
[1571.75s -> 1578.39s]  And there's just constant hordes like literally endless, constant,
[1578.39s -> 1581.19s]  like just absolute room filled with enemies.
[1581.19s -> 1584.31s]  So you're dealing with all the enemies and also the specials.
[1584.31s -> 1586.63s]  And so you just have to be like super coordinated as a team
[1586.63s -> 1590.23s]  and bring like the right weapons for, you know, whatever the mission is.
[1590.23s -> 1592.15s]  You have to be you have to be perfect your gear.
[1592.15s -> 1592.87s]  Yeah, pretty much.
[1592.87s -> 1595.35s]  And it felt but like it's also doable.
[1595.35s -> 1599.27s]  Like if you just, you know, dodge and parry perfectly and don't get hit,
[1599.27s -> 1602.07s]  then you can, you know, just avoid all damage and like it's easy.
[1603.19s -> 1603.67s]  Yeah.
[1603.67s -> 1605.83s]  Jim Martin thing was level 19, actually, when we did a five.
[1605.83s -> 1608.07s]  He'd still like could contribute.
[1608.07s -> 1610.79s]  So it's like it's doable in lower levels.
[1610.79s -> 1613.19s]  You probably need a couple of thirties to carry.
[1613.83s -> 1613.99s]  Right.
[1613.99s -> 1614.79s]  This is probably loud.
[1615.43s -> 1616.79s]  Did I turn it way too high up?
[1617.59s -> 1618.63s]  Oh, look how pretty it is.
[1618.63s -> 1619.75s]  This looks like Vermintide.
[1619.75s -> 1620.31s]  This does.
[1620.95s -> 1622.87s]  Oh, oh, wow.
[1622.87s -> 1625.27s]  Oh, swamp level is a swamp level.
[1625.35s -> 1627.27s]  This is actually pretty sick blight town.
[1627.83s -> 1628.95s]  This is this is blight town.
[1628.95s -> 1632.07s]  Also, I just got to say, sir, I don't know if you know this,
[1632.07s -> 1634.87s]  but I literally remade the character from your campaign.
[1634.87s -> 1636.31s]  Or, yeah, yeah, of course.
[1636.31s -> 1636.63s]  I know.
[1637.59s -> 1638.87s]  Yeah, I had to.
[1638.87s -> 1640.07s]  I love the character too much.
[1640.07s -> 1641.43s]  This is literally what he looked like.
[1641.43s -> 1643.27s]  So I was like, I might as well make him again.
[1644.47s -> 1649.91s]  I mean, the tattoo, but yeah, yeah, you got to praise the emperor.
[1650.47s -> 1651.51s]  And yeah, looks great.
[1651.51s -> 1654.39s]  You wouldn't be able to read the emperor tattoo and survive.
[1655.11s -> 1657.35s]  So all right.
[1657.35s -> 1658.31s]  You guys ready?
[1658.31s -> 1660.15s]  This is a three bar.
[1660.15s -> 1661.96s]  This is a three bar.
[1661.96s -> 1664.28s]  This is my first time doing a three mission.
[1664.28s -> 1665.32s]  Oh, really?
[1665.32s -> 1670.68s]  Yeah, I figured let me hit like level 10 and then I'll do threes.
[1670.68s -> 1673.72s]  But yeah, you can handle it.
[1673.72s -> 1674.20s]  I'm ready.
[1674.20s -> 1675.08s]  I'm ready.
[1675.08s -> 1676.28s]  We've never done this mission.
[1676.28s -> 1677.40s]  So what's worse?
[1677.40s -> 1678.60s]  They can have good luck.
[1680.28s -> 1681.08s]  Yes, they sharp.
[1681.08s -> 1681.80s]  Keep your head down.
[1682.60s -> 1683.08s]  Let's use those.
[1683.08s -> 1683.80s]  Stay frosty.
[1684.60s -> 1685.98s]  Stay frosty.
[1685.98s -> 1686.30s]  Stay.
[1687.96s -> 1688.28s]  Yeah.
[1692.71s -> 1695.86s]  We got a big guy over here.
[1695.86s -> 1696.26s]  Hey, guy.
[1697.06s -> 1700.14s]  He's nicely handled.
[1700.14s -> 1705.45s]  That guy's still alive.
[1706.09s -> 1706.41s]  What?
[1706.41s -> 1707.13s]  I thought he's dead.
[1707.77s -> 1708.01s]  Yeah.
[1708.01s -> 1708.25s]  Yeah.
[1708.81s -> 1709.77s]  Okay.
[1714.46s -> 1716.78s]  Kraken, what's your feeling on auto guns?
[1716.78s -> 1719.58s]  Because I'm using one right now and I'm trying to figure out if I like it.
[1720.62s -> 1721.58s]  Good for hoard clearing.
[1723.66s -> 1726.17s]  That's mostly it.
[1726.17s -> 1729.21s]  I mean, it depends if you can like aim down the sights and like hit specials.
[1729.21s -> 1730.81s]  I didn't really use them that much.
[1730.81s -> 1731.61s]  Okay.
[1731.61s -> 1736.49s]  Yeah, because I'm not sure I'm going to stick with it, but I'm just trying it out.
[1738.42s -> 1741.30s]  Also, yeah, the game just launched and I'm sure they added a bunch of stuff and I literally
[1741.30s -> 1742.66s]  just booted it up and joined this.
[1742.66s -> 1744.42s]  So I've not had a chance to look at any of the new things.
[1747.54s -> 1749.70s]  You know, I don't know all the answers now.
[1749.70s -> 1751.62s]  Why does he look like a bodybuilder at this angle?
[1751.62s -> 1752.18s]  Holy shit.
[1752.18s -> 1753.22s]  I'm keeping this angle forever.
[1758.02s -> 1759.46s]  Try like widen my shoulders up.
[1760.55s -> 1766.79s]  You need to slowly over time start like integrating like Instagram filters on your webcam.
[1766.79s -> 1767.67s]  But very slowly.
[1767.67s -> 1769.75s]  Like, yeah, like a five percent at a time.
[1769.75s -> 1770.31s]  Yeah.
[1770.31s -> 1771.75s]  So people don't notice right away.
[1771.75s -> 1774.07s]  And then like a month from now, you're just jacked.
[1774.07s -> 1777.51s]  Wait, so Joe built that in with channel points.
[1777.51s -> 1781.03s]  And if you do a channel point redeem, you can lower the opacity of his camera by 5%.
[1781.83s -> 1783.35s]  So you can slowly fade away.
[1795.05s -> 1795.77s]  Wow.
[1795.77s -> 1796.33s]  What was that?
[1799.13s -> 1801.45s]  Yes, snipers do like all of your health and death.
[1802.09s -> 1802.33s]  Yeah.
[1803.69s -> 1806.73s]  I think like 90% of my deaths are, oh, there was a sniper.
[1806.73s -> 1807.69s]  Somebody sniped.
[1807.69s -> 1808.49s]  Explosive guy.
[1808.49s -> 1809.21s]  Explosive guy.
[1811.22s -> 1812.82s]  Oh, we got a shield guy over here.
[1812.82s -> 1813.22s]  Oh, God.
[1814.02s -> 1817.19s]  Guys, we've got to learn these names eventually, man.
[1817.19s -> 1818.71s]  It's called a scab bomber.
[1822.39s -> 1823.03s]  Shield guy.
[1825.35s -> 1826.23s]  Why can I not think?
[1827.03s -> 1828.47s]  Fire guy got me.
[1828.47s -> 1828.95s]  I got you.
[1828.95s -> 1829.59s]  I got you over here.
[1838.18s -> 1843.08s]  You can also pick people up.
[1843.08s -> 1845.80s]  You can hold right click to block while picking them up.
[1847.80s -> 1848.28s]  Oh, OK.
[1851.03s -> 1854.34s]  He's got the chainsaw.
[1855.90s -> 1856.78s]  Oh, my God.
[1856.78s -> 1857.18s]  Got you.
[1858.14s -> 1858.54s]  Bad day.
[1859.66s -> 1863.26s]  Yeah, that I need to dodge more and I need to block more because I was
[1863.26s -> 1864.70s]  mainly used to shooting a lot.
[1864.70s -> 1865.82s]  But I'll get it.
[1865.82s -> 1866.22s]  I'll get it.
[1867.42s -> 1867.82s]  You're good.
[1867.82s -> 1872.38s]  I mean, when in melee, if you're not swinging, basically just I'm holding
[1872.38s -> 1873.42s]  right click for block.
[1873.42s -> 1874.06s]  You know?
[1874.06s -> 1874.54s]  Yeah, sure.
[1876.14s -> 1878.70s]  So just in between the animations, you can just throw it up in case there's
[1878.70s -> 1879.58s]  an attack coming out.
[1879.58s -> 1882.22s]  You don't see the block is actually amazing in this game.
[1882.94s -> 1884.94s]  Yeah, it's it can take a lot.
[1886.20s -> 1890.28s]  I think I also have a counter attack with my blade because like the other
[1890.28s -> 1892.92s]  button like brings it up for a second.
[1894.20s -> 1897.00s]  Yeah, you can kind of mash that and throw that in between swings too
[1897.00s -> 1899.00s]  because it doesn't really take time to do.
[1899.80s -> 1901.80s]  It's just use the stamina when it triggers.
[1902.52s -> 1903.02s]  Gotcha.
[1903.56s -> 1904.12s]  What was that?
[1905.37s -> 1905.87s]  Horde.
[1907.74s -> 1908.78s]  Grenades here, lads.
[1909.74s -> 1910.86s]  Oh, what does that sound?
[1911.74s -> 1913.98s]  We got a mutant over here.
[1913.98s -> 1917.50s]  Oh, smash.
[1917.50s -> 1918.00s]  Help.
[1919.66s -> 1920.30s]  Oh, that was you.
[1923.43s -> 1926.46s]  What the heck is another one?
[1927.98s -> 1930.70s]  All right, I got to I got to get back into the game here.
[1931.66s -> 1934.51s]  Grenade.
[1940.10s -> 1940.98s]  Hey, what the heck?
[1941.54s -> 1944.79s]  I don't know why I'm doing that right now.
[1944.79s -> 1946.79s]  Somebody said it and it got in my head and I won't get it.
[1946.79s -> 1947.11s]  I can't.
[1947.11s -> 1947.59s]  It won't leave.
[1948.55s -> 1949.05s]  What?
[1949.91s -> 1950.95s]  What the heck?
[1950.95s -> 1954.17s]  Oh, yeah, I've been saying what the heck on ironically for like two years now.
[1955.21s -> 1956.74s]  Why is it infiltrating my head?
[1957.94s -> 1962.34s]  Well, that's how bro got into my vocabulary because I turned against bro
[1962.34s -> 1966.34s]  because my high school was all just like, yo, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.
[1966.34s -> 1969.38s]  And then the past couple of years, like people say it ironically online
[1969.38s -> 1970.42s]  and I'm like, what's up, bro?
[1971.22s -> 1973.06s]  Yeah, I'm same.
[1973.06s -> 1974.18s]  I've been doing that, too.
[1974.18s -> 1974.68s]  That's weird.
[1976.18s -> 1977.44s]  Sir, sir.
[1980.22s -> 1981.45s]  We're coming.
[1981.45s -> 1981.95s]  Yeah.
[1982.89s -> 1983.53s]  Gunners down.
[1983.53s -> 1984.49s]  Machine gunners down here.
[1989.11s -> 1992.86s]  Let's try to.
[1998.49s -> 1999.53s]  Holy shit.
[2002.02s -> 2004.06s]  Oh, I'm just dead now.
[2004.78s -> 2006.54s]  I'm so sorry, everyone.
[2006.54s -> 2006.86s]  You're good.
[2006.86s -> 2007.36s]  You're good.
[2007.82s -> 2009.18s]  I thought I had way more help than that.
[2011.26s -> 2012.46s]  Oh, that's bad.
[2013.18s -> 2013.74s]  That's bad.
[2023.13s -> 2023.77s]  Oh, I'm done.
[2024.57s -> 2028.62s]  Oh, that got that got hairy.
[2029.34s -> 2034.63s]  I think we're I think we're OK, though.
[2034.63s -> 2037.03s]  I believe in you.
[2038.57s -> 2039.07s]  All right.
[2040.34s -> 2044.26s]  Thank God, there's two of you that had that are very good.
[2044.90s -> 2046.82s]  I was the first to go down.
[2046.82s -> 2047.70s]  Am I on that list?
[2051.05s -> 2051.55s]  Yeah.
[2052.70s -> 2053.26s]  Yeah.
[2053.26s -> 2054.38s]  I was the problem.
[2054.38s -> 2055.58s]  Oh, you were the issue.
[2056.30s -> 2058.04s]  It's all right.
[2058.04s -> 2059.56s]  They might have made the threes more difficult
[2059.56s -> 2063.51s]  because this is how do I get up there?
[2065.61s -> 2066.65s]  What the hell is that?
[2067.45s -> 2068.33s]  How do I get up to Vinny?
[2068.33s -> 2069.37s]  I recognize this this music.
[2069.37s -> 2069.85s]  Oh, you did it.
[2069.85s -> 2070.35s]  Thank you.
[2072.06s -> 2072.54s]  Thank you.
[2072.54s -> 2073.66s]  Oh, it's this friend again.
[2074.46s -> 2075.34s]  Oh, the beast.
[2076.14s -> 2078.06s]  OK, let me get behind him.
[2078.94s -> 2080.06s]  No, he ain't that guy.
[2080.94s -> 2081.90s]  He did eat that guy.
[2082.70s -> 2083.58s]  It was like a frog.
[2083.58s -> 2084.08s]  That was great.
[2096.46s -> 2096.96s]  Wow.
[2097.66s -> 2098.62s]  Is there ammo anywhere?
[2111.48s -> 2112.36s]  Oh, geez.
[2115.35s -> 2118.49s]  Or a little bit more.
[2120.25s -> 2121.29s]  Stop saying that.
[2123.85s -> 2126.41s]  Well, Smush, you just got like a bomb exploded.
[2130.55s -> 2132.63s]  Do we walk past the Medicaid?
[2132.63s -> 2133.99s]  I feel like I feel like we did.
[2133.99s -> 2134.31s]  Right.
[2134.31s -> 2136.55s]  Because there's no way there's hasn't been yet.
[2136.55s -> 2136.95s]  Yeah.
[2136.95s -> 2140.71s]  Maybe like some random corner we missed.
[2140.71s -> 2141.35s]  That was intense.
[2147.72s -> 2148.36s]  Dog dog.
[2149.24s -> 2152.99s]  Gotcha.
[2154.17s -> 2154.73s]  Thank you.
[2154.73s -> 2155.53s]  Oh, my goodness.
[2160.09s -> 2162.65s]  Sometimes, Jerma, you'll know what I'm talking about.
[2162.65s -> 2162.89s]  Yeah.
[2162.89s -> 2165.61s]  Sometimes they run at you and they make like noise,
[2165.61s -> 2168.57s]  but it sounds exactly like the imps from Hearthstone.
[2168.57s -> 2170.33s]  And I think like someone's playing an imp.
[2172.17s -> 2174.57s]  I hear it all the time and it weirds me out.
[2174.57s -> 2176.17s]  Do you know what I hear all the time?
[2176.17s -> 2177.37s]  And some of you guys might know this.
[2178.01s -> 2180.49s]  The Warcraft wolf sound that goes.
[2182.97s -> 2183.85s]  Do you know what I mean by that?
[2183.85s -> 2185.37s]  Definitely in the Hound Warcraft 3.
[2186.17s -> 2187.26s]  Yep.
[2187.26s -> 2190.78s]  No, just like World of Warcraft, the wolves, they go.
[2193.02s -> 2194.22s]  It's a very distinct sound.
[2194.94s -> 2195.58s]  Okay.
[2195.58s -> 2195.82s]  All right.
[2195.82s -> 2197.18s]  We have a lot of medication here.
[2197.98s -> 2203.51s]  I think someone should get it and either me or.
[2203.51s -> 2206.87s]  Yeah, I can hold off on getting it because I, you know,
[2206.87s -> 2208.63s]  I just need some regular meds first.
[2208.63s -> 2210.31s]  Yeah, I got some regular meds too.
[2213.10s -> 2214.46s]  However, I could use ammo.
[2214.46s -> 2216.30s]  If anyone finds any ammo, please let me know.
[2218.02s -> 2218.82s]  Yeah, I do too.
[2218.82s -> 2219.32s]  Bad.
[2219.96s -> 2222.48s]  It's nice to bang.
[2223.04s -> 2224.64s]  Yo, sorry, bro.
[2224.64s -> 2225.76s]  Oh my goodness.
[2228.62s -> 2229.12s]  Wow.
[2231.20s -> 2232.56s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[2233.92s -> 2248.32s]  Like I threw a grenade at his own team.
[2248.32s -> 2249.12s]  What are they doing?
[2250.00s -> 2250.80s]  Those are mine.
[2250.80s -> 2251.52s]  Oh, oh.
[2252.24s -> 2253.44s]  I'm chucking.
[2253.44s -> 2254.96s]  I generate a lot of grenades.
[2254.96s -> 2256.08s]  So I just throw them around.
[2256.64s -> 2258.27s]  Okay.
[2258.27s -> 2259.15s]  I got a grim war.
[2259.15s -> 2259.79s]  I grim.
[2259.79s -> 2260.99s]  I can't stick my head out here.
[2261.71s -> 2263.69s]  There's a gunner out there.
[2269.93s -> 2270.89s]  That's bad.
[2270.89s -> 2273.31s]  You can dodge these guys.
[2273.31s -> 2273.81s]  Check it out.
[2274.29s -> 2274.85s]  Wow.
[2274.85s -> 2275.89s]  That was sick.
[2276.93s -> 2280.16s]  Did I do that?
[2280.16s -> 2280.88s]  I'm okay.
[2280.88s -> 2281.28s]  I'm fine.
[2281.28s -> 2281.84s]  You did it.
[2281.84s -> 2282.56s]  It's fine.
[2282.56s -> 2283.04s]  I'm all right.
[2283.84s -> 2284.32s]  I'm sorry.
[2284.32s -> 2285.76s]  I just Steve Urkeled, by the way.
[2287.74s -> 2288.70s]  Did I do that?
[2289.26s -> 2289.90s]  Oh my God.
[2290.62s -> 2295.55s]  All right.
[2295.55s -> 2299.38s]  That sniper just walked up into melee.
[2299.38s -> 2302.66s]  He walked up, started reloading, and then it was like, wait.
[2303.38s -> 2304.26s]  Wait a minute.
[2304.26s -> 2304.82s]  Wrong class.
[2305.78s -> 2308.38s]  Thought I was on my other character.
[2309.18s -> 2310.38s]  That's a lot of people.
[2311.10s -> 2317.41s]  This is going well for a three.
[2318.05s -> 2318.77s]  Yeah, it actually is.
[2319.49s -> 2320.29s]  Not bad.
[2320.29s -> 2320.93s]  You're still alive.
[2322.37s -> 2325.12s]  Oh, ammo.
[2325.76s -> 2329.66s]  Oh, German.
[2329.66s -> 2330.06s]  Yeah.
[2330.06s -> 2331.58s]  Oh, thank goodness.
[2333.02s -> 2338.06s]  Oh, you got it.
[2341.84s -> 2347.36s]  Like I still live.
[2349.14s -> 2350.66s]  I keep smushing this guy's head.
[2350.66s -> 2351.30s]  He won't die.
[2354.32s -> 2355.76s]  Is he all right?
[2355.76s -> 2358.94s]  All right.
[2358.94s -> 2359.90s]  Oh, I can drop some healing.
[2359.90s -> 2360.38s]  Let's do that.
[2361.02s -> 2362.74s]  Oh, yes.
[2362.74s -> 2364.74s]  Is this a sponsor stream or can we say dick?
[2365.30s -> 2367.30s]  I mean, you could.
[2372.02s -> 2374.34s]  Minus 20 bucks for each time dick is set.
[2376.32s -> 2377.36s]  You should do that, dude.
[2377.36s -> 2379.44s]  Like a swear jar for sponsored streams.
[2379.44s -> 2379.84s]  Yeah.
[2379.84s -> 2380.48s]  Yeah.
[2380.48s -> 2382.64s]  Darktide is like a really family friendly.
[2382.64s -> 2385.68s]  There's nothing weird about this game at all.
[2385.68s -> 2386.80s]  No disturbing themes.
[2388.32s -> 2390.08s]  In fact, Warhammer is for the whole family.
[2392.94s -> 2393.66s]  This guy.
[2393.66s -> 2394.30s]  Come on.
[2396.40s -> 2397.12s]  Die already.
[2398.00s -> 2405.15s]  All right.
[2406.14s -> 2407.26s]  Oh, we all can heal here.
[2415.15s -> 2415.47s]  Got him.
[2421.92s -> 2422.24s]  All right.
[2422.24s -> 2422.64s]  So now.
[2427.42s -> 2428.22s]  Yeah, this is perfect.
[2430.14s -> 2431.42s]  We need all of this.
[2431.42s -> 2432.22s]  It's got four.
[2432.22s -> 2432.70s]  Yeah, four.
[2433.90s -> 2434.54s]  Oh, perfect.
[2435.50s -> 2438.22s]  Yeah, but I need to do it twice.
[2441.07s -> 2444.35s]  It's my character's fatal flaw that he has to heal twice every time he heals.
[2445.15s -> 2445.79s]  Sorry, guys.
[2445.79s -> 2446.59s]  I don't make the rules.
[2448.62s -> 2450.78s]  What is there?
[2450.78s -> 2451.66s]  Was there no ammo crates?
[2453.01s -> 2453.81s]  Um.
[2453.81s -> 2455.01s]  No, I didn't see anything.
[2455.01s -> 2456.93s]  There's one tiny one up here.
[2456.93s -> 2459.01s]  Who has no ammo?
[2459.01s -> 2460.77s]  Oh, is this the right thing?
[2460.77s -> 2461.33s]  Are you sure?
[2461.33s -> 2461.97s]  How much ammo do you have?
[2462.93s -> 2464.13s]  I a little bit.
[2464.13s -> 2465.09s]  I'll just melee.
[2465.09s -> 2466.45s]  I have to get better at melee anyway.
[2467.17s -> 2467.73s]  Oh, shit.
[2467.73s -> 2468.05s]  Sorry.
[2468.69s -> 2469.41s]  I was going to give it to you.
[2469.41s -> 2470.53s]  Did I sneeze?
[2470.53s -> 2471.73s]  I just accidentally clicked.
[2471.73s -> 2472.37s]  She yelled Biff.
[2473.49s -> 2476.29s]  It wasn't even.
[2476.29s -> 2478.53s]  It was like a very weird annunciation.
[2480.45s -> 2481.57s]  Wait, what did you think I said?
[2482.13s -> 2482.37s]  Biff.
[2484.29s -> 2485.01s]  Hey, Biff.
[2485.57s -> 2487.09s]  What did you say?
[2487.09s -> 2487.97s]  I sneezed.
[2489.41s -> 2491.25s]  That was like a fake sneeze.
[2491.25s -> 2492.69s]  Someone sneezes just goes Biff.
[2494.62s -> 2496.06s]  Why would that come through like that?
[2496.78s -> 2497.18s]  I don't know.
[2497.18s -> 2498.46s]  It's exactly what it sounded like though.
[2498.46s -> 2499.18s]  I'm not making it up.
[2499.18s -> 2499.82s]  Get that ammo.
[2500.86s -> 2507.89s]  Throwing a grenade.
[2511.34s -> 2511.58s]  Nice.
[2513.18s -> 2516.94s]  Do you think everyone on Earth has a unique sneeze, like a snowflake?
[2517.58s -> 2517.98s]  Kind of.
[2519.41s -> 2520.85s]  I have a duck sneeze.
[2520.85s -> 2522.21s]  I saw like a duck one I sneezed.
[2522.21s -> 2522.71s]  Yeah.
[2523.33s -> 2523.83s]  I'm like.
[2526.61s -> 2527.11s]  Yeah.
[2527.81s -> 2529.41s]  I don't know if that thing's called.
[2531.38s -> 2531.88s]  Dog.
[2532.26s -> 2534.74s]  Call it by just the correct name or I'm not helping you.
[2534.74s -> 2535.22s]  What is this?
[2535.22s -> 2535.86s]  Scab dog?
[2536.66s -> 2537.30s]  Scab dog.
[2538.02s -> 2538.58s]  Hey, what's up?
[2539.54s -> 2541.42s]  A flesh rot.
[2545.71s -> 2546.99s]  Ooh, actually, I don't.
[2546.99s -> 2547.95s]  I wish this was ammo.
[2548.67s -> 2552.03s]  Mine's a cipheridin.
[2552.03s -> 2552.67s]  Cipheridin.
[2553.95s -> 2555.23s]  Anyone need grenades?
[2555.23s -> 2555.73s]  Hey.
[2557.23s -> 2558.19s]  Oh, yeah.
[2558.19s -> 2560.75s]  This part of the map has a weird song.
[2560.75s -> 2561.47s]  A weird song?
[2562.03s -> 2562.91s]  I heard that.
[2562.91s -> 2564.03s]  It's a little synthy thing.
[2564.03s -> 2565.15s]  I don't know what it was.
[2565.15s -> 2566.11s]  I'm still confused.
[2567.73s -> 2568.77s]  It is a different song.
[2571.47s -> 2573.15s]  Gotta go cyberpsycho on these guys.
[2574.59s -> 2575.23s]  Time to chrome up.
[2575.95s -> 2578.93s]  Time to chrome up, Chum.
[2580.93s -> 2582.29s]  Ooh, I kind of like it.
[2584.18s -> 2586.26s]  Guys, I'm not good at this.
[2586.90s -> 2588.90s]  I'm being attacked up here by someone with armor.
[2588.90s -> 2589.94s]  Come, come, come, go, go, go, go.
[2592.19s -> 2594.03s]  Like I tried to dodge and block.
[2594.03s -> 2594.67s]  I was failing.
[2594.67s -> 2595.55s]  I was bad at it.
[2595.87s -> 2604.85s]  So I don't know if they changed it for the launch, but in the beta,
[2604.85s -> 2608.61s]  your class, Vinny, gets the strongest melee weapon of the game at high level.
[2610.21s -> 2612.21s]  So that's kind of when your melee pops off.
[2612.21s -> 2614.29s]  I don't know if you have a lot of melee stuff before then.
[2615.49s -> 2617.09s]  I only have the most basic stuff.
[2617.09s -> 2618.13s]  I'm not really crazy about it.
[2619.01s -> 2622.29s]  I felt like when I leveled and got past level 10,
[2623.01s -> 2626.13s]  I just suddenly got a million more options and it was a lot.
[2626.13s -> 2626.69s]  Help!
[2626.69s -> 2628.61s]  Are you, are you in my class too, sir?
[2628.61s -> 2629.33s]  Help!
[2629.33s -> 2629.65s]  I don't know.
[2629.65s -> 2630.61s]  What am I doing over here?
[2632.61s -> 2633.49s]  What am I doing over here?
[2633.49s -> 2634.85s]  Why am I so far away?
[2634.85s -> 2636.05s]  You just ran backwards.
[2636.85s -> 2637.17s]  All right.
[2637.81s -> 2638.99s]  Oh, you found it.
[2641.38s -> 2642.10s]  Oh, no.
[2642.10s -> 2642.34s]  Okay.
[2642.34s -> 2643.46s]  So this mission is a weird one.
[2643.46s -> 2645.46s]  We have to use press four.
[2645.46s -> 2649.86s]  You take out a little Game Boy and then we go to scan different things.
[2649.86s -> 2650.34s]  Oh, yeah.
[2652.34s -> 2653.94s]  And then proceed.
[2653.94s -> 2654.58s]  I got grabbed.
[2655.54s -> 2656.34s]  I'm getting smushed.
[2656.98s -> 2660.51s]  Izzy, you're going to have to deal with that on your own.
[2665.06s -> 2670.16s]  Okay.
[2670.16s -> 2670.64s]  I got one.
[2672.86s -> 2673.18s]  Nice.
[2673.82s -> 2674.22s]  Nice.
[2674.22s -> 2674.86s]  That was huge.
[2677.10s -> 2681.60s]  You got two already?
[2682.16s -> 2682.40s]  All right.
[2682.40s -> 2684.24s]  No, yeah.
[2684.24s -> 2685.36s]  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2686.32s -> 2691.42s]  Where's this guy going?
[2692.14s -> 2692.86s]  What the hell?
[2693.58s -> 2695.50s]  He lives to trap another day.
[2695.50s -> 2696.14s]  I do like that.
[2696.14s -> 2697.58s]  They actually leave like they missed.
[2697.58s -> 2698.46s]  They're like, oh, fuck.
[2698.46s -> 2699.02s]  I'm out of here.
[2703.70s -> 2704.18s]  Another one.
[2704.90s -> 2705.95s]  Izzy.
[2705.95s -> 2706.51s]  Oh, he just hang.
[2707.31s -> 2708.96s]  He's just hanging over there.
[2708.96s -> 2709.52s]  Here he comes.
[2710.24s -> 2711.20s]  What was he doing?
[2711.84s -> 2712.72s]  What were you thinking?
[2713.28s -> 2714.16s]  Grimoire over here.
[2714.72s -> 2716.00s]  Oh shit, really?
[2716.00s -> 2716.16s]  Yeah.
[2716.16s -> 2716.72s]  Grimoire.
[2716.72s -> 2717.76s]  Are we feeling brave?
[2717.76s -> 2718.48s]  I'll pick it up.
[2719.82s -> 2720.38s]  What do you guys think?
[2721.18s -> 2721.50s]  Yeah.
[2721.50s -> 2721.82s]  Dog.
[2723.76s -> 2724.48s]  Dog dead.
[2724.48s -> 2724.96s]  Not dead.
[2724.96s -> 2725.52s]  Dog alive.
[2726.08s -> 2727.04s]  Dog alive.
[2727.04s -> 2728.16s]  No, I'm about to die.
[2728.16s -> 2730.72s]  If I die, Parma, I'm going to drop a Grimoire.
[2730.72s -> 2731.28s]  Oh, that's bad.
[2731.28s -> 2731.60s]  Shit.
[2731.60s -> 2731.84s]  All right.
[2731.84s -> 2732.32s]  They're coming.
[2732.32s -> 2732.96s]  It's gone for good.
[2732.96s -> 2733.28s]  They're coming.
[2733.28s -> 2733.52s]  They're coming.
[2733.52s -> 2733.84s]  They're coming.
[2733.84s -> 2734.08s]  They're coming.
[2734.08s -> 2734.56s]  They're coming.
[2734.56s -> 2735.60s]  It's gone for good now.
[2736.80s -> 2737.36s]  Dog on me.
[2737.92s -> 2739.68s]  Yeah, I usually want the tanky people to pick him up.
[2740.32s -> 2741.04s]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[2741.04s -> 2742.00s]  What the fuck?
[2742.00s -> 2743.76s]  They keep using the same exit strategy.
[2744.56s -> 2746.69s]  Smart ass dog.
[2750.08s -> 2751.04s]  Is the dog still alive?
[2751.68s -> 2752.48s]  He's roughing at me.
[2753.76s -> 2754.64s]  Don't forget to use the...
[2755.60s -> 2756.80s]  It's the bodies in here.
[2762.24s -> 2763.60s]  Oh, thank God.
[2764.32s -> 2766.59s]  I just...
[2766.59s -> 2767.07s]  What did I just...
[2767.07s -> 2767.79s]  Oh, okay.
[2767.79s -> 2768.59s]  We need ammo, don't we?
[2768.59s -> 2769.23s]  Does everybody need it?
[2770.35s -> 2770.75s]  You got it.
[2771.55s -> 2773.07s]  It's an ammo case.
[2773.07s -> 2773.55s]  I do.
[2773.55s -> 2774.11s]  You drop it.
[2774.11s -> 2774.75s]  Okay, I'll put it down.
[2775.47s -> 2777.95s]  I'm back.
[2777.95s -> 2778.35s]  Thank you.
[2779.31s -> 2780.19s]  Who's doing that?
[2783.81s -> 2785.41s]  What the fuck?
[2785.41s -> 2787.74s]  There it was.
[2787.74s -> 2788.30s]  There was the imp...
[2793.68s -> 2794.16s]  I'm dead.
[2794.16s -> 2794.72s]  For real dead.
[2799.94s -> 2800.66s]  I'm sorry.
[2800.66s -> 2801.62s]  I'm screaming too much.
[2803.38s -> 2804.26s]  Stressful situation.
[2804.26s -> 2806.34s]  Dude, I had a large coffee this morning.
[2806.34s -> 2807.06s]  I'm sorry.
[2808.02s -> 2813.68s]  My God.
[2817.30s -> 2817.54s]  Okay.
[2817.54s -> 2818.18s]  Are we all right?
[2818.90s -> 2819.46s]  We're okay.
[2820.66s -> 2821.78s]  Thank you for saving me.
[2821.78s -> 2822.82s]  I'm prisoner.
[2822.82s -> 2823.46s]  You're welcome.
[2823.46s -> 2823.94s]  Prisoner.
[2824.10s -> 2824.74s]  Make sure to get the ammo.
[2824.74s -> 2825.14s]  Are you a prisoner?
[2825.78s -> 2826.66s]  That's super smart.
[2826.66s -> 2827.54s]  If you guys didn't get the ammo,
[2827.54s -> 2828.42s]  make sure you get it.
[2828.42s -> 2829.78s]  You didn't hear my whole backstory.
[2829.78s -> 2830.66s]  It's a whole thing.
[2830.66s -> 2831.78s]  Hey, if nobody got it.
[2831.78s -> 2832.26s]  Seriously.
[2833.14s -> 2834.50s]  All right.
[2834.50s -> 2835.14s]  We have one more.
[2837.33s -> 2837.81s]  I think back...
[2837.81s -> 2839.01s]  It's where Vinny is right now.
[2839.01s -> 2839.65s]  I'll lead the way.
[2840.37s -> 2845.15s]  I do like this music.
[2845.15s -> 2846.51s]  This whole game has had good music,
[2846.51s -> 2847.87s]  but I check how weird and...
[2848.75s -> 2849.47s]  Cynthia it is.
[2849.47s -> 2850.75s]  Oh, I'm being attacked.
[2852.27s -> 2856.42s]  I just pressed F instead of E.
[2856.42s -> 2857.22s]  How dare I?
[2857.94s -> 2861.12s]  I'm throwing.
[2861.84s -> 2862.64s]  Oh, my God.
[2863.52s -> 2864.16s]  God damn it.
[2864.16s -> 2865.28s]  That's going to be the reason why we lose
[2865.28s -> 2865.76s]  because of that.
[2866.86s -> 2867.66s]  Because I pressed F.
[2867.66s -> 2867.90s]  Okay.
[2871.01s -> 2871.89s]  Oh, my God.
[2880.48s -> 2880.96s]  You know what it is?
[2880.96s -> 2882.00s]  It's that I have an axe,
[2882.00s -> 2886.24s]  and axes are not the best crowd control, right?
[2886.24s -> 2888.16s]  Yeah, they're really bad for crowd control.
[2888.16s -> 2888.96s]  A good one on one.
[2888.96s -> 2890.32s]  I have an axe for...
[2890.32s -> 2890.72s]  They're all...
[2890.72s -> 2891.60s]  They're good at single target,
[2891.60s -> 2892.96s]  and then I have this charge gun
[2892.96s -> 2895.12s]  that is good at single target,
[2895.12s -> 2896.08s]  and then I'm getting boarded.
[2897.04s -> 2898.72s]  They're coming from behind here.
[2898.72s -> 2900.64s]  I feel like I'm inside the game right now.
[2900.64s -> 2901.60s]  Is my music too loud?
[2904.35s -> 2905.07s]  It gets in your head.
[2905.07s -> 2907.07s]  You're definitely like very mercy.
[2907.95s -> 2909.39s]  They're shooting at us.
[2909.39s -> 2910.51s]  Is this the pile of bodies?
[2910.51s -> 2911.47s]  Was it here this whole time?
[2912.11s -> 2912.67s]  Oh, my God.
[2912.67s -> 2913.31s]  It was.
[2913.31s -> 2913.87s]  All right.
[2913.87s -> 2914.51s]  Head back, guys.
[2914.51s -> 2914.91s]  We did it.
[2917.39s -> 2918.19s]  We got to head back?
[2918.19s -> 2918.43s]  Okay.
[2924.06s -> 2924.86s]  I thought that was you,
[2924.86s -> 2925.98s]  Sturr, for a second hitting me.
[2926.78s -> 2927.82s]  Oh, yes, me prisoner.
[2928.54s -> 2929.26s]  I get that a lot.
[2931.02s -> 2932.54s]  Has anyone ever called you Sturr fry?
[2934.14s -> 2934.38s]  No.
[2935.82s -> 2936.38s]  Can I?
[2936.38s -> 2937.90s]  How did I miss?
[2937.90s -> 2939.50s]  Sometimes when I make a Sturr fry,
[2939.50s -> 2940.70s]  they'll say Sturr fry.
[2946.46s -> 2947.50s]  Oh, my God.
[2947.50s -> 2948.06s]  It hurts.
[2948.78s -> 2952.88s]  I just took 100 bullets in the head.
[2952.88s -> 2957.15s]  Thank you so much.
[2957.15s -> 2958.83s]  You need to use the stealth mechanic more.
[2960.03s -> 2960.83s]  We just got to run.
[2960.83s -> 2961.63s]  Oh, that was a lie.
[2961.63s -> 2962.43s]  I just crouched, dude.
[2963.15s -> 2965.70s]  I'm taking all my anger out on you.
[2967.25s -> 2967.49s]  See?
[2967.49s -> 2969.01s]  Look at how much I just fucked that guy up.
[2969.01s -> 2969.81s]  Just threw him.
[2969.81s -> 2970.61s]  Yeah.
[2970.61s -> 2972.21s]  There was a lot of anger behind that.
[2972.21s -> 2974.13s]  Oh, they should make like a melee thing
[2974.13s -> 2974.77s]  for the auger.
[2974.77s -> 2976.37s]  And we just grabbed someone by the face.
[2976.37s -> 2978.29s]  So this giant just chucks them.
[2979.33s -> 2983.33s]  I'll use them as a range.
[2984.21s -> 2986.56s]  What's that guy going?
[2986.56s -> 2987.44s]  That guy's just running.
[2988.16s -> 2990.32s]  Why are we all laughing at this guy?
[2990.32s -> 2991.12s]  I need to kill him.
[2991.92s -> 3010.56s]  I can't hit that.
[3019.06s -> 3019.30s]  Yeah.
[3019.30s -> 3021.06s]  Next time, let's call the elevator before.
[3022.26s -> 3023.06s]  Smush.
[3023.06s -> 3026.34s]  Oh, he's just blood thirsty.
[3026.34s -> 3028.26s]  I know you just fiending to kill,
[3028.90s -> 3030.58s]  but we're good.
[3031.22s -> 3031.78s]  Surprise.
[3033.06s -> 3035.22s]  Jerma's blood lust knows no boundaries.
[3037.04s -> 3038.00s]  Blood thirsty.
[3045.12s -> 3046.24s]  A dog coming in.
[3052.03s -> 3053.15s]  I love the acting in this game.
[3053.15s -> 3054.19s]  The voice acting is so good.
[3058.38s -> 3058.62s]  Yeah.
[3058.62s -> 3059.50s]  So pipe back.
[3060.30s -> 3060.54s]  Dog.
[3061.50s -> 3062.82s]  Ow.
[3062.82s -> 3063.14s]  Ow.
[3063.14s -> 3063.38s]  Ow.
[3063.38s -> 3066.18s]  Oh, ouch.
[3066.18s -> 3066.58s]  Owie.
[3070.90s -> 3071.30s]  Ogre.
[3071.86s -> 3072.58s]  Big ogre man.
[3074.13s -> 3075.09s]  Big ogre man just threw me.
[3075.65s -> 3075.97s]  Oops.
[3078.10s -> 3078.98s]  Save Copernicus.
[3078.98s -> 3080.58s]  Oh, no.
[3080.58s -> 3081.82s]  Put him down.
[3082.62s -> 3083.26s]  Oh, shit.
[3083.26s -> 3084.30s]  There's so many over here.
[3087.23s -> 3089.47s]  Did your guy actually just start going nom, nom, nom, nom?
[3090.03s -> 3090.75s]  Am I crazy?
[3091.79s -> 3092.11s]  What?
[3093.95s -> 3094.51s]  Enemy.
[3094.51s -> 3094.83s]  Okay.
[3096.59s -> 3097.71s]  I don't know what's going on.
[3097.71s -> 3098.99s]  It just devolved into it.
[3098.99s -> 3100.43s]  No idea what these things are.
[3100.43s -> 3101.31s]  Special enemy.
[3103.39s -> 3104.43s]  Ammo over here.
[3104.43s -> 3105.23s]  If anyone needs it.
[3106.03s -> 3107.15s]  Special enemy.
[3109.98s -> 3112.70s]  I could hear the strain in your brain trying to get the words out.
[3115.58s -> 3120.06s]  I can't even like rack my brain like appropriately because I'm just like scared.
[3122.53s -> 3123.57s]  Oh, look how pretty this is.
[3123.57s -> 3124.29s]  Yeah, this looks great.
[3126.51s -> 3126.91s]  Oh, what?
[3126.91s -> 3127.39s]  Demon host.
[3127.39s -> 3127.87s]  All right.
[3127.87s -> 3129.15s]  Do not walk up to that thing.
[3129.95s -> 3132.67s]  It's going to be like a icy ground.
[3132.67s -> 3133.39s]  Just walk around it.
[3133.39s -> 3133.87s]  Don't look at it.
[3133.87s -> 3134.19s]  Don't, don't.
[3135.71s -> 3136.11s]  What?
[3136.11s -> 3136.91s]  You did it.
[3136.91s -> 3137.63s]  Oh, no.
[3137.63s -> 3138.11s]  Should we run?
[3138.11s -> 3139.07s]  Don't shoot it, don't shoot it, don't shoot it.
[3139.07s -> 3139.55s]  Just run.
[3139.55s -> 3140.19s]  Don't shoot it, don't shoot it.
[3140.19s -> 3141.15s]  Wait, there's ammo over here.
[3142.03s -> 3142.59s]  Okay.
[3142.59s -> 3143.47s]  Oh, we're not okay.
[3143.47s -> 3144.03s]  It's bad.
[3145.07s -> 3148.08s]  Oh, my God.
[3148.08s -> 3148.80s]  It's on German.
[3150.69s -> 3153.65s]  Wait, did I, did I aggro it?
[3153.65s -> 3154.85s]  I thought it was already aggroed.
[3154.85s -> 3155.73s]  I thought we already aggroed it.
[3155.73s -> 3158.13s]  It was just waking up and then you kept going into it.
[3158.13s -> 3159.65s]  I thought it was already aggroed.
[3160.69s -> 3161.57s]  I, oh.
[3161.57s -> 3162.29s]  Oh, he's on me now.
[3162.29s -> 3162.85s]  This is bad.
[3162.85s -> 3163.35s]  All right.
[3164.69s -> 3166.53s]  It leaves after it kills too, I think.
[3166.53s -> 3168.61s]  Yeah, but I'm trying not to die if I can help it.
[3169.41s -> 3171.57s]  I thought it was already aggroed, so I thought it was safe to get the ammo
[3171.57s -> 3173.25s]  because I thought, fuck, we're going to fight it anyways.
[3174.35s -> 3174.85s]  Okay.
[3176.08s -> 3176.72s]  Nice.
[3176.72s -> 3178.32s]  Well, actually, technically, you got it, Kraken.
[3179.33s -> 3180.13s]  Oh, cool.
[3180.13s -> 3181.81s]  It said Copernicus got the kill, so.
[3182.69s -> 3184.29s]  Yeah, I'm a bleed build, so.
[3185.09s -> 3185.33s]  All right.
[3185.33s -> 3186.37s]  Oh, that makes sense.
[3186.37s -> 3188.29s]  That was the, hey, this icy ground over here
[3188.29s -> 3191.01s]  and every person in the party, I just watched like, oh, like this.
[3191.01s -> 3192.13s]  What, was this it?
[3192.13s -> 3193.65s]  We just waltzed on in.
[3193.65s -> 3194.93s]  It slips on ice.
[3194.93s -> 3198.53s]  For my defense, I thought it was already aggroed to the party.
[3200.94s -> 3201.90s]  Yeah, yeah.
[3201.90s -> 3206.14s]  In my defense, I actually, I acted perfectly and appropriately,
[3206.14s -> 3207.50s]  which gives me the high ground here.
[3207.50s -> 3208.78s]  Hey, remember when you died first that time
[3208.78s -> 3210.62s]  and said it was all your fault that we almost lost?
[3210.62s -> 3211.98s]  I was being nice to Vinny.
[3214.43s -> 3218.88s]  It's not so nice to reveal that.
[3219.60s -> 3221.52s]  That's very rude to reveal right now.
[3221.52s -> 3222.96s]  Hey, if you're going to aim your gun at me,
[3222.96s -> 3224.32s]  I'm going to pull out all my firearms.
[3225.68s -> 3228.72s]  Yeah, but Vinny didn't, I, you should have made,
[3228.72s -> 3229.84s]  you should have talked shit about me.
[3229.84s -> 3233.92s]  You, like, from my perspective, you are like a vacuum for Vinny
[3233.92s -> 3234.72s]  because I don't really know him.
[3234.72s -> 3235.60s]  Yeah, from my perspective.
[3235.60s -> 3236.72s]  I'm going to attack your friend.
[3237.68s -> 3239.04s]  From my perspective.
[3239.60s -> 3242.24s]  Yeah, like you got, you two are on like one side
[3243.20s -> 3244.24s]  and I'm not a part of it.
[3245.44s -> 3247.76s]  Can't we all be on the same team?
[3247.76s -> 3249.84s]  No, no, we're, we're, we're part of it now, Starb.
[3249.84s -> 3251.20s]  We're all in this together, buddy.
[3251.20s -> 3251.68s]  Come on.
[3251.68s -> 3252.48s]  All right.
[3252.48s -> 3253.28s]  And we all agree.
[3257.22s -> 3261.86s]  I mean, technically it was free aggroed already
[3262.42s -> 3265.06s]  and I just fall on aggroed.
[3265.94s -> 3268.82s]  It has two phases of aggro where it's crying like a witch
[3268.82s -> 3270.02s]  and then it stands up and goes.
[3270.90s -> 3271.78s]  Yeah.
[3271.78s -> 3273.22s]  And then, yeah, okay.
[3273.22s -> 3273.86s]  Now you know.
[3273.86s -> 3274.26s]  All right.
[3274.26s -> 3274.58s]  All right.
[3275.22s -> 3276.66s]  So you aggroed phase two.
[3276.66s -> 3277.94s]  So I'll, I'll take the,
[3277.94s -> 3280.18s]  I'll go 50-50 on somebody for the loss there.
[3280.18s -> 3282.10s]  I'll, yeah, I was the first one aggroed.
[3282.10s -> 3283.06s]  So I'll take the first 50.
[3284.42s -> 3285.30s]  Oh my God.
[3285.30s -> 3286.18s]  Did you see that?
[3286.18s -> 3287.38s]  What did you just do?
[3288.74s -> 3289.46s]  What the hell?
[3290.34s -> 3292.74s]  Vinny, it's remarkable that you grabbed the banister.
[3293.87s -> 3296.67s]  I know my character's reflexes are like.
[3297.47s -> 3297.95s]  All right.
[3297.95s -> 3299.07s]  That was like a gymnast.
[3299.07s -> 3300.11s]  Before he started.
[3300.19s -> 3301.39s]  Are they like precogs?
[3301.39s -> 3302.19s]  Like people that have like.
[3302.19s -> 3302.75s]  We can't.
[3302.75s -> 3302.99s]  Yeah.
[3302.99s -> 3303.31s]  Right.
[3303.31s -> 3304.99s]  Like psychokinesis and stuff.
[3304.99s -> 3305.31s]  Okay.
[3305.31s -> 3307.71s]  Let's, let's do it and immediately be ready to go.
[3308.27s -> 3309.31s]  I think it's going to start a bridge, right?
[3309.31s -> 3309.79s]  And then we run out.
[3309.79s -> 3310.27s]  Yeah.
[3310.27s -> 3310.77s]  Okay.
[3311.39s -> 3312.27s]  Can I play?
[3313.31s -> 3314.27s]  We're working on it, man.
[3315.31s -> 3316.51s]  Maybe don't die next time.
[3316.51s -> 3322.85s]  Oh.
[3324.22s -> 3325.10s]  No, no, no, I'm good.
[3325.10s -> 3325.74s]  I think I'm good.
[3325.74s -> 3326.54s]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[3327.50s -> 3328.06s]  There he is.
[3328.86s -> 3329.82s]  Oh, yeah.
[3329.82s -> 3330.86s]  You're a squishy little boy.
[3330.86s -> 3331.82s]  Just keep going backwards.
[3332.38s -> 3332.54s]  Yeah.
[3332.54s -> 3333.98s]  I'm going to go backwards and attack.
[3333.98s -> 3335.82s]  And I'll just thank you for the grenade that helped.
[3338.85s -> 3339.17s]  Oh God.
[3339.17s -> 3339.81s]  They got guns.
[3339.81s -> 3340.69s]  Untie me.
[3341.65s -> 3342.37s]  Little one.
[3351.42s -> 3352.86s]  Terrogate the security stacks.
[3353.58s -> 3356.86s]  Holy shit.
[3357.42s -> 3359.34s]  It's a whole thing.
[3359.34s -> 3359.74s]  Yeah.
[3359.74s -> 3364.75s]  I think this is like, um, no, there's one more thing.
[3364.75s -> 3365.55s]  I think a skull.
[3366.43s -> 3371.33s]  It's actually a servo skull.
[3372.45s -> 3373.57s]  Come on, dude.
[3373.57s -> 3377.49s]  Technically, the consciousness is sometimes still attached to the servo skull.
[3378.13s -> 3381.17s]  Listen, I could tell you everything about the Blade Runner universe.
[3381.17s -> 3381.33s]  Yeah.
[3381.33s -> 3382.29s]  It's only two movies.
[3382.93s -> 3383.41s]  It's easy.
[3386.32s -> 3387.36s]  Name every blade.
[3391.26s -> 3392.99s]  Is that the one with the vampires?
[3394.61s -> 3395.33s]  Oh my God.
[3397.46s -> 3400.02s]  I fell asleep during the new Blade Runner in theaters.
[3400.02s -> 3400.82s]  Oh, no.
[3400.82s -> 3403.30s]  You fell asleep during Blade Runner?
[3403.30s -> 3408.90s]  I saw like 30% of that movie, but every once in a while, like dramatically in a scene,
[3408.90s -> 3412.74s]  it has like a big like, I woke up like a bunch of times instantly.
[3412.74s -> 3413.86s]  I went right back to bed.
[3414.50s -> 3417.86s]  So why did you go see the movie so tired?
[3419.30s -> 3423.09s]  Uh, you were just like exhausted.
[3423.09s -> 3424.21s]  I don't think I was tired.
[3424.21s -> 3425.41s]  I think the movie made me tired.
[3425.89s -> 3427.89s]  Wow, that's so okay.
[3429.97s -> 3432.13s]  I saw the first part of the movie.
[3433.09s -> 3434.53s]  That's crazy.
[3434.53s -> 3442.21s]  I went to see Mad Max Fury Road after pulling an over 24 hour thing with my friends.
[3442.21s -> 3444.61s]  And we like just showed up the movie like completely blurry.
[3447.57s -> 3449.49s]  I do love Mad Max Fury Road.
[3449.49s -> 3452.13s]  I think was made better that I was like so sleep deprived.
[3452.13s -> 3454.37s]  Like every single like rumble in the theater.
[3454.37s -> 3457.41s]  I like felt like it was rocking me to bed.
[3461.63s -> 3465.15s]  I'm trying to think if there's ever been a movie that I've fallen asleep to in the theater.
[3465.15s -> 3466.27s]  I don't think so.
[3466.27s -> 3467.23s]  Yeah, I don't think I have either.
[3467.95s -> 3470.11s]  Not in the theater, but at home plenty.
[3470.11s -> 3470.61s]  Yeah.
[3473.15s -> 3477.15s]  I was I was watching Scorsese's last movie, The Irishman.
[3477.15s -> 3478.03s]  It's like four hours.
[3478.03s -> 3479.63s]  I fell asleep like five times.
[3479.63s -> 3480.13s]  Wow.
[3480.91s -> 3482.27s]  But I, you know, just to resume.
[3482.99s -> 3484.67s]  Sorry, I was supposed to talk about Warhammer, right?
[3484.67s -> 3485.23s]  Sorry.
[3485.23s -> 3487.47s]  Yes, Scorsese's Warhammer.
[3488.35s -> 3489.15s]  Right.
[3489.15s -> 3490.67s]  There's another one of his lost movies.
[3492.03s -> 3493.47s]  It's actually a huge 40k fan.
[3496.83s -> 3498.56s]  All right.
[3498.56s -> 3499.84s]  Starring the Rock, right?
[3500.56s -> 3501.04s]  That's it.
[3502.56s -> 3505.92s]  He's in the jungle and he's wearing like a tight brown t-shirt.
[3508.48s -> 3512.64s]  Someone like doesn't say something kindly about the emperor and he does the eyebrow
[3512.64s -> 3514.08s]  and the crowd is like, what?
[3514.08s -> 3517.20s]  Yeah, you know, you know, it's about to go down.
[3520.56s -> 3526.48s]  Do do do do do.
[3526.48s -> 3531.87s]  I'm surprised there's has there ever been a Warhammer like T movie or like TV show or

[3772.82s -> 3776.98s]  that i'm telling it's one of my favorite sound effects favorite pieces of any video game in
[3776.98s -> 3782.42s]  history you hear them all like screaming and you hear like the tide coming towards just something
[3782.42s -> 3791.54s]  about it it's that like they're like chanting it's terrifying it really it's one of my favorite
[3791.54s -> 3798.22s]  things i didn't even play vermintide that much it really is still one of my favorite things
[3798.22s -> 3805.49s]  that's the uh this game whenever you fight the uh the captain i just like mute everything turn the
[3805.49s -> 3817.65s]  turn the music up yeah that's the perfect look all right so i gotta buy some new stuff do um
[3817.73s -> 3823.81s]  oh wow if i'm watching your stream germa but it's paused or no do you get dry i don't know
[3823.81s -> 3827.73s]  that's a good question just for drops yeah i was like just to check your chat and stuff
[3828.37s -> 3833.09s]  but uh i can unpause it to give you i think it has to be unpaused i think you have to be like
[3833.09s -> 3840.66s]  watch time drop it down to 240p get a backpack minimize i like the difference okay getting the
[3840.66s -> 3847.06s]  job done i got you in 160p right now germa and you look like like i got a vaseline filter over
[3847.06s -> 3857.95s]  your screen can you do that well tell me how it looks now let me see um your pectorals are
[3857.95s -> 3861.71s]  bursting through the vaseline i don't think you've got the brains really because i didn't do
[3861.71s -> 3877.70s]  anything i just lean back oh okay oh what's this kubrick stare i i hate to do this to you guys do
[3877.70s -> 3887.17s]  you have a favorite kubrick movie um i don't know i have to like i'd have to list them out gotcha
[3887.17s -> 3893.55s]  because there wasn't very many right no it was there was only like what like seven eight something
[3893.55s -> 3902.59s]  like that 10 yeah all right let me go to the uh is the armory uh available yeah uh yeah the
[3902.59s -> 3906.03s]  armory's available there's also the other way first time seeing these microtransactions you
[3906.03s -> 3914.96s]  get like gucci pants for the zealot dude what's this ahoy but you can call me my lady i want a
[3914.96s -> 3919.76s]  hellbore laser gun i hear that one's good oh and don't bother telling me your name my darling
[3919.76s -> 3924.64s]  they are really fun i've been using it a lot but it gets hard to aim at things
[3925.44s -> 3930.16s]  oh really is it's uh it's like iron sights and then also the front of your gun glows red
[3931.36s -> 3939.86s]  but it's a really fun gun i want these i've got 2500 gamer coins yeah i do
[3942.05s -> 3954.10s]  oh let me look at these jacket oh okay i got the hellbore i'm gonna upgrade it and
[3954.10s -> 3958.02s]  see if i like it all right it is it is somebody's birthday happy birthday what was their name
[3958.58s -> 3966.98s]  happy birthday isaac is it your birthday today happy birthday isaac kicking ice cream is on its
[3966.98s -> 3976.93s]  way yeah and yes uh those chat members barry linden is my favorite uh kubrick movie i didn't
[3976.93s -> 3984.45s]  all right i don't know why i'm an idiot i need some kraken knowledge they edit they edit percentage
[3984.45s -> 3990.69s]  numbers to the uh the sliders on the stats for weapons i don't think that they had the
[3990.69s -> 3995.68s]  number there before oh yeah the number is new yeah i i guess you wouldn't know then maybe because
[3995.68s -> 4004.51s]  it's like 50 seems average and it very rarely goes above 50 it's so as it was explained to me
[4004.51s -> 4011.87s]  the eye level like the rating of the item itself is how much value is then randomly distributed
[4011.87s -> 4019.07s]  amongst these different uh you know what the hell is this thing have you seen any that are
[4019.07s -> 4030.00s]  actually like one of the bars is almost full um my pistol is 79 full on damage and 74 on mobility
[4030.00s -> 4036.80s]  so it's like it's i think like pokemon if you ever played that like yeah yeah like distribution
[4036.80s -> 4042.51s]  right i was just worried uh wondering because like every item that i've seen and have is like
[4043.78s -> 4049.62s]  it doesn't go beyond 54 percent yeah same here for yeah i think it'll get higher as you get more
[4050.18s -> 4058.53s]  so this the i i just unlocked the second row i guess of items that i can get a charm or something
[4058.53s -> 4066.69s]  yeah so curious you can equip and it will um you can like get additional experience per level you
[4066.69s -> 4073.41s]  can get additional money because it has a blessing and a perk it's like blessings and then perk
[4073.41s -> 4079.55s]  should i buy this i'm gonna get it buy them so i would buy one uh there's currently a bug
[4079.55s -> 4083.79s]  apparently that if your toughness if you buy a toughness trinket and it goes above 100
[4084.43s -> 4088.35s]  uh it doesn't actually protect your health like it's supposed to so i'm actually having to
[4088.35s -> 4095.15s]  unequip them on my guy so okay but other than that i think it's uh good for grinding experience
[4095.15s -> 4105.52s]  and good for grinding uh money even i don't think maybe i should get another weapon what do i got
[4106.08s -> 4116.45s]  does this thing better than i have yeah i got the hellbore laser and i upgraded it to blue
[4117.25s -> 4126.22s]  so i'm hoping it i like it because otherwise that would have been a bad choice i'm gonna try this
[4126.78s -> 4134.06s]  the plus one wound means you can go down one more time oh wait i can be downed twice yeah
[4134.06s -> 4140.58s]  and on the higher difficulties we start off with less wounds so it's good for um yeah limiting how
[4140.58s -> 4148.02s]  much times you go down or for higher difficulties you need plus wound trinkets that's cool i'm gonna
[4148.02s -> 4158.42s]  try this looks cool it's like uh i think i tried this once maybe before that's a good question when
[4158.42s -> 4167.55s]  do we get the warhammer um i already have it zealots get the warhammer no no time to time to
[4167.55s -> 4178.24s]  reroll it's pretty fun all right cool you beat the game then yeah well no you have to get to
[4178.24s -> 4186.10s]  collect 40 000 war hammers actually it's it's kind of a grind so what else is new um let's see we got
[4189.12s -> 4194.05s]  i think we hailed we did that we handled that pretty well oh no that's not i don't think that's
[4194.05s -> 4198.59s]  new actually um we can handle the three when we just did handle the three i mean it was a little
[4198.59s -> 4203.60s]  hairy but we did it yeah you want to do another hairy three yeah now that we have a little
[4203.60s -> 4208.48s]  practice and we know we know how to like shoot better and stuff i think we can do another three
[4208.48s -> 4217.81s]  that's so much money you get 14 15 000 gold to do um to do a four so much let me know what you guys
[4217.81s -> 4232.05s]  think of my new drip yeah me too oh nice i'd like a gimp's mask yo nice goggles smush yep what they
[4232.05s -> 4238.05s]  were saying earlier in the other group your mask is avoiding your hair yeah it's the perfect
[4238.05s -> 4243.33s]  haircut for this mask all right i think it's the other way around your hair is avoiding your mask
[4243.57s -> 4248.94s]  you are completely comfortable in that thing yeah all right lads
[4251.66s -> 4256.78s]  get ready the bat why do i do the bat chest face i know i do it and it's annoying to me
[4257.82s -> 4276.75s]  you do i do i go like and like i like i know i'm just the bat chest i want a pistol
[4280.61s -> 4285.65s]  so how does this oops okay no all right so yeah i've used this before it has a stab
[4286.45s -> 4293.42s]  so just to confirm everybody the audio levels music chat everything sounds good sometimes hard
[4293.42s -> 4301.02s]  to tell when uh yeah that's an issue i have too i always have to confirm it's such a streamer
[4301.02s -> 4309.44s]  paranoia thing it is germa there were okay so i do a lot of pre-recorded stuff too and um i was
[4309.44s -> 4316.56s]  having an issue with my sound drivers and my uh card and i recorded several full two hour long
[4316.56s -> 4324.88s]  like segments with bad audio i could not fix and and two times i had to like redo my commentary
[4324.88s -> 4328.48s]  that's the that's the worst you don't record it on like separate audio tracks
[4329.44s -> 4334.72s]  no no no uh you know i was pre-recording like just kind of a let's play kind of thing and um
[4335.52s -> 4338.88s]  yeah it was like yeah it was separate audio but my voice was totally ruined
[4339.68s -> 4350.99s]  oh because like um that's my vst hosts so i'll give you an example i sounded like i sounded like

[4616.13s -> 4620.13s]  let's restart yeah we did get spawned on with big demon thing that wasn't our fault that was not
[4620.13s -> 4628.61s]  our fault just restart it was uh it was a bug yeah it definitely wasn't me that activated that so
[4629.82s -> 4640.78s]  for sure well good because i was about to blame you that was close that is delicious what is it
[4641.42s -> 4653.41s]  green tea a rarity it is a great it is a green tea energy formula not like a real coffee
[4654.13s -> 4661.79s]  i like green tea kit kats have you ever had those no they sound pretty good though awesome
[4666.30s -> 4672.14s]  what makes it green there is matcha powder in it so that's what makes it green
[4674.14s -> 4682.13s]  all right req redo i actually don't think i want to use this weapon it's just unfortunate
[4682.13s -> 4688.13s]  because it was eight thousand dollars yeah i kind of also made a mistake i got the hellbore laser
[4688.13s -> 4693.82s]  and i'm not sure i'm loving it yeah i did that to you i i'm trying to use other stuff but
[4694.54s -> 4706.78s]  i do think the shop reset did it reset yeah all right i'll try it again now okay where can i
[4712.70s -> 4719.57s]  get a reset also i didn't recognize that though is your instruction uh mine is not reset
[4720.61s -> 4729.42s]  sir you just lied to i mean probably two or three hundred thousand people watching right now
[4731.01s -> 4736.93s]  i think that they will enjoy the engagement created by their anger towards me
[4737.73s -> 4745.66s]  okay just the thing for you they will enjoy the anger they won't know that they're enjoying it
[4745.66s -> 4749.74s]  and they won't know that they're more engaged but they are where is um the
[4750.54s -> 4754.13s]  not the it's over here right if i can upgrade this
[4760.02s -> 4773.50s]  i afford to do this oh oh no how many do i need 150
[4773.50s -> 4777.84s]  shit yeah the upgrading is a little complicated right now it seems like
[4779.02s -> 4785.84s]  where it incentivized to wait till you hit max level okay but at least to get like purples yeah
[4785.92s -> 4796.59s]  the purples are what i'm looking for i'll use what i was using before i think i like it all
[4796.59s -> 4802.06s]  right ready to just req try that again yeah want to do the same one or do some different um what's
[4802.06s -> 4809.94s]  it something like oh sorry no whatever whatever you guys want to do is there's something like
[4809.94s -> 4822.66s]  navigators from dune in the boarhammer universe i don't know what is that oh maybe they're answer
[4822.66s -> 4826.90s]  they're juiced up with spice so that they can see the future as they light travel
[4826.90s -> 4833.04s]  through space yeah like practically another species from how much spice they've been juicing
[4833.04s -> 4837.36s]  up on and like yeah they're like weird fish creatures because they evolved because they
[4837.36s -> 4842.96s]  took too much spice and uh instead of using computers to navigate ftl drives they they just
[4842.96s -> 4847.52s]  use these weird spiced up fish creatures yeah so apparently that exists in more hammer they're
[4847.52s -> 4853.17s]  just called navigators and they they help navigate through space because space is chaos and
[4853.65s -> 4857.97s]  they're like on the brink of insanity at all times but are used as basically a tool
[4858.61s -> 4865.94s]  so we so we are of all the different factions and everything right so this game is it wait
[4865.94s -> 4872.74s]  wait hold on this game copied dune and starcraft i don't know when these these things were written
[4874.02s -> 4881.06s]  um the timeline hold on a minute hold on just a minute like through the roof right now hold on
[4881.06s -> 4890.56s]  just a minute warhammer was first motherfuckers wait wait what warhammer was first it was the
[4890.56s -> 4897.10s]  first of all these play of all these things actually well i don't want to lose you ad money
[4901.57s -> 4908.61s]  um actually warhammer excuse me the only book you need to be reading because it came first
[4908.61s -> 4917.97s]  is the bible everything copied the bible okay what what that's not a false statement
[4917.97s -> 4923.23s]  you want to do another three do you want to do two what's the vibe germa's choice
[4923.23s -> 4926.83s]  uh we'll do three we can do three we just we gotta lock in we gotta get in the middle
[4926.83s -> 4934.62s]  all right uh let's see this one all right guys lock in let's get in the middle all right let's
[4934.62s -> 4939.18s]  get them okay if you want i'm gonna be really careful about like those witch things whatever
[4939.18s -> 4943.74s]  they are what does what does get in the middle mean to you germa what does that mean like it's
[4943.74s -> 4950.74s]  it's like a three let's get in the middle like it's a three out of five oh like no i don't want
[4950.74s -> 4954.26s]  to do two i don't want to do a four i would do right in the middle three two and a half
[4957.74s -> 4969.94s]  i think i just cancelled i know it um germa is about to i don't know what that means where'd
[4969.94s -> 4976.59s]  my hair go look at my look at my hat yeah you know your hair is gone who shaved my head

[4997.73s -> 5003.57s]  it's actually gone that was my whole character your whole character arc you gotta finish a run
[5003.57s -> 5009.57s]  can't die to a demon all right let's look your hair go i don't want to hear about other franchises
[5009.57s -> 5013.81s]  i don't want to hear about all the other favorite movies that you have or other
[5013.81s -> 5017.09s]  books that you've read in the last few years all i care about
[5017.09s -> 5023.57s]  oh yeah i don't care i don't want to hear about the bible i want us to to rock this
[5024.13s -> 5034.14s]  right in the middle three star okay right down the center it's a nice just three out of six
[5034.14s -> 5047.55s]  i don't care about the bible i did it i did long bomb i'm that guy oh you got the achievement
[5047.55s -> 5053.31s]  yeah for the hellbore laser do you recommend charging it fully each time or is it okay to
[5053.31s -> 5059.31s]  just kind of like well uh charge it if the if it's not a normal enemy
[5060.27s -> 5064.27s]  this is the god the edge but if you headshot normal enemies they should go down in one hit
[5064.27s -> 5075.74s]  without a charge how am i so dead already die i am dead i am dead already i am dead already
[5076.62s -> 5083.41s]  your guy literally just said i'm not dead yet i am dead already there's some narrative dissonance
[5083.41s -> 5095.76s]  right now between smush on comms and smushing game that's right they're big somebody said you
[5095.76s -> 5102.35s]  need to dodge about you flying a plane oh that's tomorrow okay plane tomorrow
[5104.19s -> 5106.99s]  that's the only explanation i'm gonna give yeah that's tomorrow all right
[5107.71s -> 5117.38s]  that's fine good luck don't die yeah i'm gonna be on uh you know austin show yeah yeah i'm gonna
[5117.38s -> 5123.06s]  be on austin show stream and we're gonna be you know we're operating a plane
[5123.94s -> 5128.66s]  a plane like a plane honestly it feels really weird that you're promoting something that
[5128.66s -> 5139.89s]  isn't warhammer right now because i'm like knowing germa he's probably like learned and
[5139.89s -> 5144.69s]  you know got his pilot's license put 10 000 hours in and is now actually flying a real plane
[5145.41s -> 5149.25s]  oh god and he did this all in the last two months like that's that's where my mind went
[5150.05s -> 5161.54s]  oh we're supposed to be focusing and you guys are still talking about the bible
[5162.18s -> 5170.83s]  and the plane sorry i'm just glad you're not like putting yourself in danger for a bit that's good
[5171.39s -> 5176.67s]  no no it's gonna it's gonna be fun okay it's gonna be a fun time i'm actually pretty excited
[5176.67s -> 5189.71s]  for it it seems very very interesting this is something i probably should have asked a long
[5190.11s -> 5198.96s]  time ago do headshots actually matter for most of weapons or no yes so even like explosives
[5199.76s -> 5206.46s]  explosives like if you hit somebody right in the head anything that has a projectile or a melee
[5208.54s -> 5214.70s]  that makes contacts it is better yeah so the mauler has apparently more armor on the head
[5220.67s -> 5224.03s]  once again i've forgotten i think i hear another demon host down the hallway
[5224.59s -> 5238.66s]  is that what that was i was hitting the whispers too yeah it might be all right i don't want to
[5238.66s -> 5250.67s]  waste ammo oh stuff in here we got uh gonna you should take that thanks
[5253.15s -> 5258.27s]  all these smgs feel like you shoot a normal enemy 600 times and then you just keep walking here
[5259.07s -> 5263.63s]  yeah you might like be uh your aim doesn't sound very good does it
[5265.38s -> 5270.18s]  oh i went down here oh man you just self-reported you self-reported that you can't get headshots
[5270.98s -> 5301.89s]  until you get the uh the bolters there it's gonna change it won't oh shit it won't uh-oh
[5303.89s -> 5308.93s]  what that that was entirely my bad i was trying to get the sniper i tunnel visioned and now i'm
[5308.93s -> 5313.09s]  gonna die goodbye everyone good luck with the demon host first
[5317.89s -> 5321.81s]  it's going to kill one other person so just pick uh pick who it's gonna be
[5322.77s -> 5328.82s]  i'll take full responsibility for that what was that that like laugh did you hear that
[5328.82s -> 5337.79s]  that's gonna be me oh hey just let it happen that's fine is live just don't worry about me
[5338.43s -> 5346.26s]  avoid demon host and live stir what's what's only you and me okay let's live

[6977.26s -> 6982.30s]  locker room speech yeah yeah actually before we start the level how about you give us a lot of
[6982.30s -> 6994.48s]  speech a little ed germa you're so cringe more because i have pep talking friends to try to do

[7127.33s -> 7133.71s]  yeah i mean i've spent a while but like after wilderness it was like here's like the breakdown
[7133.71s -> 7140.59s]  of like like different rating like commentary right like this comment was out of line you
[7140.59s -> 7145.63s]  well it's the timestamps and it's the overall like your emotional level your commentary your
[7145.63s -> 7152.35s]  attitude one by one well i know i download all of your vods and i and i and i write over it in red
[7152.35s -> 7158.08s]  pen and i circle like oh over here you see you didn't you miss this part and uh your face came
[7158.24s -> 7173.84s]  glitched out at this point too that was you don't watch mine then okay cool all right
[7176.00s -> 7185.84s]  boys boys sniper one again what the fuck is he yeah he's like he runs up to the corner takes
[7185.84s -> 7201.42s]  your shot and then just like walks away i'm assuming gun melee even with a bayonet isn't
[7201.42s -> 7207.82s]  as good as regular melee right i believe so no you can still headshot with them and it'll kill
[7207.82s -> 7212.94s]  most guys in one hit but that gun with usually the bayonet guns have such a long time to switch
[7213.66s -> 7231.87s]  that if it's just one guy it's worth it okay i can't believe it's 70 i'm gonna die i'm just
[7231.87s -> 7240.53s]  puked yeah like in real life what the heck is happening to my character heresy he's with
[7240.53s -> 7253.33s]  nurgle this guy fucking puked streamer pukes live on stream i'm good we're doing the world

[8106.38s -> 8112.93s]  that's according to a chat message even after you've triggered it we have to wait for the
[8112.93s -> 8119.09s]  responses put in your pocket and wait wait wait for his response um and whatever it is ban him
[8121.22s -> 8135.44s]  because i didn't ask the answer is i believe it's yes okay well let's find out so where do we have
[8135.44s -> 8142.00s]  to obtain this thing where is it not ready yet nope can't switch weapons should i ban them
[8142.00s -> 8146.00s]  you just died yeah definitely ban them actually throwing actually throwing
[8147.84s -> 8151.20s]  germa was throwing because he read chat and we both we all told him not to

[8409.98s -> 8414.70s]  well dink is actually an acronym for double income no kids so him and his wife had no kids
[8414.70s -> 8420.06s]  and they were just like gaming the system so that's why he was called mr dink no way
[8420.06s -> 8426.70s]  just like the dinklebergs it wasn't the finster his kid i don't know who that is the blue one
[8427.50s -> 8431.18s]  no that's skeeter dude the best part about that every time he would come on screen
[8432.14s -> 8433.34s]  it would always do like the
[8438.75s -> 8441.15s]  i like did you wait what did you just say
[8443.10s -> 8446.78s]  i was trying to say pox burser but you said talks and you shot oh i thought you said

[8663.71s -> 8676.29s]  loving it sorry i'm still thinking about the finster the finster yeah i i think after this i

[8682.45s -> 8687.41s]  back but i didn't i reloaded and my face is sweating crank and i gotta show you this little
[8687.41s -> 8691.17s]  doug video it's in it's fresh in my mind because someone made a little animated short of some dumb
[8691.17s -> 8700.45s]  bit with mr dink that i did i'll show you after the stream it's fun every day off
[8701.09s -> 8709.89s]  douglas uh oh every day and what and again we are doing a mr dink impression
[8710.61s -> 8717.49s]  and getting attacked by a special enemy every time i do an impression i get attacked

[9418.91s -> 9425.39s]  levels from that i got a ring out my underwear just all the piss you're just constantly

[9440.30s -> 9445.20s]  if you guys remember like 30 minutes ago when we were doing the kermit the frog thing
[9445.20s -> 9451.09s]  was i was that my idea i don't happen remember yeah i think we just kind of fell into it
[9451.65s -> 9460.67s]  it's pretty bad i do frog i would lay down my life friend here augren looks like trevor from gta
[9466.42s -> 9473.78s]  yeah tremors about that big i think that'll be it for me lads that that was a good one too
[9474.67s -> 9478.83s]  yeah it's a good one to end on um it's it's a shame i never got to play a match with connor we
[9478.83s -> 9484.83s]  talked for like 13 seconds and that was it but um i wonder uh i wonder if connor's still around

[9500.34s -> 9506.75s]  pleasure yeah buddy and uh stir it was really nice to meet you man i i think um i think we had some
[9506.75s -> 9512.56s]  good matches today yeah it was fun uh nice to meet you too well take it easy guys bye that's
[9512.56s -> 9519.46s]  what's all that's what's all about right there that's right douglas that's what it's all about
[9519.46s -> 9529.28s]  like you and your friend skater bye say a little bit uh that was crazy that was actually
[9529.28s -> 9543.97s]  i felt that one that was a intense one oh i got money too i got a lot of money can i get
[9546.53s -> 9556.21s]  oh this thing's 200 wait is this a shield oh my god oh my god i think the plasma gun is a liability
[9557.18s -> 9566.11s]  it's it's difficult to use well yeah i miss i miss my other gun we wish that but happy birthday
[9566.11s -> 9576.48s]  yeah we're not getting offered high level guns of good guns yeah what constitutes a maniac
[9576.48s -> 9584.22s]  maniac is an enemy title uh anyone who is a follower of your steam group the inhumane
[9584.22s -> 9593.94s]  maniacs i think yeah but i mean in the game um i think it's like the mutants and like the
[9593.94s -> 9601.14s]  berserkers like the cultist looking dudes with no clothes on oh psychopaths my bad yeah is this
[9601.14s -> 9608.22s]  thing better i mean it does a more a little bit more damage i like what this is better heavy
[9608.22s -> 9616.37s]  attack is better cleave is better weapons have a rating plus 100 cleave on three seconds for
[9616.37s -> 9623.34s]  multiple melee hit that seems pretty amazing how much money do i have whatever i want it
[9627.57s -> 9633.39s]  and stamina is stamina health or is no stamina is the bar that you do the running and stuff and
[9633.39s -> 9638.18s]  dodging right yeah so this is plus two max stamina what do we what do you have for stamina
[9638.18s -> 9656.05s]  is it out of 10 that is out of 15 hmm be paying honor that's like a 30 increase that's really
[9656.05s -> 9672.08s]  good really that seems pretty good class dependent that means two more little bars i'll get i mean i
[9672.08s -> 9677.33s]  is it better than what i have here is it better to be able to run more and dodge more or is it better
[9677.33s -> 9683.39s]  to be able to be revived more than another extra time higher difficulty levels you're gonna need
[9684.03s -> 9689.66s]  wounds which lets you get revived more because they automatically like reduce you by like two
[9689.66s -> 9694.56s]  i think of the higher level ones but for now i think running and dodging is also good i don't
[9694.56s -> 9700.16s]  i've never really noticed stamina upgrades because it's like it's kind of a percentage so i can't
[9700.16s -> 9710.38s]  really tell let's see i'll try more of it let's see if it's uh if i notice a difference new knife i
[9710.38s -> 9717.70s]  kind of need a new weapon or i need to upgrade this one i it's usually a good idea as you're
[9717.70s -> 9722.98s]  leveling up just to buy a new weapon every once in a while because yeah it your your armory
[9722.98s -> 9728.18s]  rolls based on what your current highest like level items are not the ones equipped but just
[9728.18s -> 9735.89s]  in your inventory yeah this thing's 167 damage this oh what that auto pistol is using earlier
[9735.89s -> 9743.60s]  is 21 on damage that i'll be right back oh yeah that was my entire time leveling all way to 30
[9743.60s -> 9748.80s]  i didn't understand that system at all and i was using nerf weapons and i understood it but i
[9748.80s -> 9752.40s]  remember buying i was like yeah i just i bought it because it was a high item level not because
[9752.40s -> 9756.64s]  i wanted to use it but then i saw it in my inventory like i'll give this one a try wait
[9756.64s -> 9763.55s]  what do you mean that it's it's kind of hard to explain the item level stuff is like kind of
[9763.55s -> 9768.11s]  complicated but so you take someone's rating just the rating that's on the weapon so i think that
[9768.11s -> 9774.03s]  it's like the rating is the number like a literal number of that goes into the the stats of your
[9774.03s -> 9777.95s]  item right and if you look at the modifiers there's like percentages for damage mobility
[9777.95s -> 9785.07s]  penetration yada yada and so those percentages are reflecting of how much of the number of the
[9785.07s -> 9790.27s]  rating has gone into each of those so i have a weapon with low percentage damage then it's
[9790.27s -> 9795.95s]  actually weak you know in terms of damage but the rating is the overall power and then the
[9795.95s -> 9810.48s]  bars are the distribution of that power oh that's interesting okay that's very interesting so
[9811.36s -> 9821.33s]  let me didn't realize that yeah it's a interesting system okay i think i understand it and the other
[9821.33s -> 9828.29s]  part is uh so you know those grays greens blues and purples and legendary you know quality
[9829.39s -> 9836.82s]  as you move up that quality scale it'll have they'll get a higher like item rating but it's
[9836.82s -> 9842.74s]  dependent on what it was first at as a gray so for example the dagger i'm using i technically got
[9842.74s -> 9849.46s]  at like level 20 so it's not an end game dagger if i got a new dagger at level 30
[9849.46s -> 9856.61s]  it would have a higher ceiling it could be upgraded further yeah so if you see a gray it
[9856.61s -> 9861.73s]  doesn't mean it's necessarily bad if it's got like a decent item rating level because you can
[9861.73s -> 9872.21s]  upgrade it and then it'll you know reach higher than your existing stuff oh okay yeah i'm still
[9872.21s -> 9878.99s]  figuring out too it's not it's not solved by any means but but how much money do i have somebody
[9878.99s -> 9888.56s]  said i should buy something i don't know i think connor might not be available we may need to
[9888.56s -> 9896.54s]  either do a random or fill i'm down it doesn't matter i'm down for either one if we can grab
[9896.54s -> 9906.77s]  somebody we can let me check with my other group yeah let's see if charborg is still around yeah
[9906.77s -> 9924.46s]  i'm down i'm down to play for like at least another at least another couple missions i really want to
[9924.46s -> 9932.38s]  i saw stripping to use this the other day and it was insane which one that uh the heavy stubborn
[9932.46s -> 9941.60s]  the heavy machine gun thing oh yeah twin linked heavy stubborn that's that's fun yeah uh charborg
[9941.60s -> 9946.67s]  said earlier that he was would be around but it has been a couple of hours so i think he might
[9946.67s -> 9959.39s]  be doing something uh i want to let me go to the where is the training dummy place i've never seen
[9959.39s -> 9971.04s]  it it's um it's like a big circular room with a lady in a tube do you ever you ever go to disney
[9971.04s -> 9975.76s]  world of disneyland like years ago and they had that one like alien escape ride yep there was like
[9975.76s -> 9980.18s]  an alien in a tube in the middle of the room yeah it was terrifying yeah that's what you're
[9980.18s -> 9984.98s]  looking for it's that room okay that actually is pretty helpful because i'll know that exactly
[9984.98s -> 10001.23s]  when i see it i'm gonna say it's right over here yep all right charbrooke says he's doing
[10001.23s -> 10008.88s]  something else right now but he'd be down later the meat grinder oh the meat grinder is what it's
[10008.88s -> 10023.04s]  called yes that's interesting uh unfortunately connor connor's game is not working yeah looks
[10023.04s -> 10034.72s]  like i think my other group is already a team of four so probably can't let's see i mean let me take
[10034.72s -> 10051.68s]  a look yeah any any game that has four player co-op a lot of times it's funny when you get like two
[10051.68s -> 10056.94s]  groups of three or two groups of like you know there's three and three and it's like well yeah
[10062.67s -> 10074.88s]  we can just do a random that's that doesn't matter we could also do that oh we could we could pull
[10074.88s -> 10104.74s]  i mean is it and who's who's playing it right now let's see is a raid coming in where oh what
[10104.74s -> 10112.11s]  happened my game a little fuzzy is it pussy yeah fuzzy that's back people saying love because
[10112.11s -> 10121.94s]  there's lovely playing it right now are you guys looking for a gamer i don't think lovely is playing

[10131.15s -> 10140.96s]  oh oh oh no he didn't oh what what did like a youtube to twitch raid i think that's illegal
[10140.96s -> 10147.60s]  uh he'd eat i think he sometimes would put like a link up but i guess he didn't do it i think
[10147.60s -> 10155.90s]  people just uh i'm being lied to um all right well i mean who is we could get uh let's see

[10299.84s -> 10303.28s]  connor would have been fun he was right he was ready he was raring and ready to go but apparently
[10303.28s -> 10308.64s]  the game just um was apparently was having some issues with it yeah probably you know launch day
[10308.64s -> 10314.16s]  there's always going to be some technical hiccups here and there but hey we got vr josh so we're
[10314.16s -> 10319.50s]  ready to go it's been mostly stable for me thankfully i i turned our rtx off and that
[10319.50s -> 10326.26s]  definitely helped the frame rate and everything yeah i do while we have a minute here i do want
[10326.26s -> 10331.46s]  to say again thank you warhammer for the sponsor i also want to say that the game is available

[10435.89s -> 10466.34s]  connect back in let's try it again relaunching there's around 60 minutes slow mode isn't what
[10466.34s -> 10474.29s]  was the longest slow mode 30 minutes i think 30 minutes slow mode so you get one message every
[10474.29s -> 10480.78s]  30 minutes that's is it even a chat room or is it a forum at that point are you making fun of my
[10480.78s -> 10487.54s]  chat you have 30 minutes slow mode on they can type faster you don't you have 30 minutes slow mode
[10488.02s -> 10495.97s]  no that's just how often people message no what do you mean people talking to chat all the time
[10497.34s -> 10503.74s]  yeah but i'm i'm getting them angry for the engagement oh i see what you say yeah yeah
[10503.74s -> 10510.93s]  yeah it blew up after that it's great all right paid by the message actually on twitch it's true
[10510.93s -> 10519.30s]  it is true all right should let's get this rolling here it's weird i maybe have to restart too i can't
[10519.30s -> 10525.33s]  join or invite you to my strike team i restarted just because why not yeah i relogged it just
[10525.33s -> 10529.89s]  figured i want to point out this wasn't happening before josh showed up yeah my bad
[10529.89s -> 10540.59s]  he infected our all of our computers i guess maybe i'll try restarting too it's not tuesday
[10541.31s -> 10556.96s]  steam no we can't we can't blame it on maintenance today i think i dced let me see if i can okay i

[10604.29s -> 10608.98s]  going over the backstory of your character prisoner again oh i i need germa's permission
[10608.98s -> 10614.02s]  because he's already heard it and i'm a non-double tell same story oh yeah that is another rule
[10614.02s -> 10620.77s]  cross my heart i hope to die need permission uh you have the backstory the prisoner your
[10620.77s -> 10626.85s]  prisoner or something uh so my last name is prisoner it's just a coincidence but also
[10627.65s -> 10633.46s]  crazier coincidence wait no wait we wrote the backstory okay start over you know how you have
[10633.46s -> 10639.62s]  a job and like people's like in fantasy times their last name was based on their job yeah that's me
[10639.62s -> 10644.58s]  so like three generations ago my great great grandfather he said that the emperor doesn't
[10644.58s -> 10653.39s]  wipe and they sentenced our whole family lineage into prison so now it's like it's a last name it's
[10653.39s -> 10660.93s]  a family name oh i got you ready thank you for asking i appreciate it oh uh i think we got
[10660.93s -> 10667.04s]  everybody uh we're missing your judge yeah i tried joining through steam and it said unable
[10667.04s -> 10671.36s]  i think it's because you joined me while i was joining him so try try joining again i just sent
[10671.36s -> 10676.98s]  you another invite see if you get it oh there it is now popped up yeah all right let's go there we
[10677.22s -> 10681.76s]  go just took an extra minute or so it's okay we thinking you want to stick with the threes
[10683.04s -> 10688.00s]  what are you feeling i think i don't know why why was this i wasn't showing the screen the whole
[10688.00s -> 10700.45s]  time sorry about that uh oh uh oh i was bouncing around a little i was bouncing around quick get
[10700.45s -> 10705.36s]  us in and get us in an instance get us in a new instance quick do you do you want to do a three
[10705.36s -> 10711.38s]  again um let's go with a nice simple two at this point right well nice little simple two let's
[10711.38s -> 10737.47s]  chill it out with the two why not have a relaxing session drops waiting room they're on how long do
[10737.47s -> 10745.86s]  you have to watch to get a drop like 30 minutes it's 30 minutes then you need to claim it and
[10745.86s -> 10749.94s]  there's like eight drops but you have to claim it in order to get the next drop
[10751.46s -> 10757.17s]  yeah so just go to the drop page every time you get it so you should be able to get everything
[10757.17s -> 10762.70s]  available with the course of three four hours right yeah i think they they did split some of
[10762.70s -> 10767.50s]  the drops under different like days i think there were some for the relaunch beta stuff
[10768.14s -> 10783.44s]  oh all right let's go for it it's time headphones going in squalor does not automatically equate to

[10927.04s -> 10930.72s]  a shield right now like he's if he's trying to tank he needs the shield and he's really kind of
[10930.72s -> 10939.28s]  throwing by not equipping one wow oh demoralizing if i heard that i probably would i would stop

[11174.22s -> 11180.30s]  it's multiplayer you can't stir stir you forgot to say this was when we were live on on twitch
[11180.94s -> 11184.22s]  oh yeah yeah we were me and germa were playing we're streaming it was quick play
[11184.78s -> 11189.74s]  and i really want to win the match and i didn't want to like get up and like if i didn't keep
[11189.74s -> 11198.22s]  gaming we were gonna lose yeah ilios oh king of the hill oh yeah that's intense yeah it was like
[11198.22s -> 11203.26s]  one more point i i gotta win this night you know i shit myself a little but this is not made up
[11203.26s -> 11207.50s]  this is actually that people like oh what a funny story no he shit his pants when we were
[11207.50s -> 11215.58s]  streaming overwatch this is not a made-up story and i don't even know what to do in that situation
[11215.58s -> 11221.50s]  it sounds like you were clear and transparent with everyone about it immediately yeah when we
[11221.50s -> 11225.34s]  did uh there was like a twitch rival for overwatch i think i did and they're like hey write in any
[11225.34s -> 11229.02s]  extra info you want to you know say about yourself like yeah i shit myself once to win a quick play
[11229.66s -> 11234.78s]  like i'm open about it i'm pretty proud honestly i feel like it shows my dedication as a streamer
[11234.78s -> 11240.30s]  and a gamer yeah and yeah loyal friend like when the stakes are low they don't matter it's not
[11240.30s -> 11244.78s]  ranked and you're just goofing off with your friends i'll be the guy shitting himself to win
[11247.10s -> 11252.22s]  yeah the fact that it was quick play is just like you could have just walked away
[11252.22s -> 11260.40s]  wait you could have just you could have just left i think we gotta come up here and go up
[11260.40s -> 11266.96s]  or down wait would we oh go upstairs and then drop down here bet i looked at that wall like
[11266.96s -> 11273.92s]  four times like it looks like there's kind of a ladder there is no it's an optical illusion
[11273.92s -> 11280.75s]  rapper i mean honestly like could you could we make fun of you for that i i don't think so
[11280.75s -> 11284.43s]  i really don't i think you can only make fun of someone if they're ashamed about it
[11284.43s -> 11293.02s]  right like if you can make fun of me but like i okay yeah who cares all right yeah i don't i
[11293.02s -> 11296.46s]  don't think that's even oh whatever like yeah i shit my pants who cares yeah who cares
[11303.78s -> 11308.02s]  it doesn't it doesn't like define me but also if you want to define me by that i'm fine with it
[11308.66s -> 11314.45s]  you know oh this is a bit of a maze here right now yeah we just have to go down here
[11314.45s -> 11324.05s]  i think and then you go around scanning yeah i very often um you know going to the gym got a
[11324.05s -> 11330.61s]  trainer working out going hard um i i thought i almost was gonna shit myself doing like uh
[11330.61s -> 11334.53s]  a spot once like every once in a while you know i'll like do a squat and like fart
[11334.53s -> 11343.94s]  you know it's just shit happens you know i i i don't have the i don't know the word
[11344.50s -> 11354.51s]  vowel control no i don't sure the vowel control somebody ashamed of
[11363.89s -> 11368.53s]  sphincter fortitude i think i'll go with sphincter fortitude
[11373.82s -> 11378.22s]  like what's the point honestly in society where like oh i gotta like put this much effort into
[11378.22s -> 11384.19s]  holding a singular fart like i'm straining and sweating like why not just do it i think
[11384.19s -> 11388.99s]  that's what nurgle teaches i i am the wrong person to be in a call talking about this
[11389.55s -> 11395.07s]  dude if i have to fart i will go to a different country to do it you know what i mean like i i
[11395.07s -> 11400.18s]  don't want to be in the same room as anybody i will literally get on a train and like for an
[11400.18s -> 11406.32s]  hour and then to go fart not be around anybody is it like an abandoned train okay grab the people
[11406.88s -> 11413.68s]  here's the stipulation you show up to work out you go to you go you're gonna do a deadlift and
[11413.68s -> 11418.96s]  as you go down you know that if you like strain your body you're going to fart do you just you
[11418.96s -> 11424.00s]  wuss out and you don't deadlift like there's no way around you have to like hold on hold on i
[11424.00s -> 11432.02s]  gotta go like clear my bowels uh there's an ammo thing here i need an answer wait hold on say
[11432.10s -> 11438.42s]  everything again i don't think your chat wants me to know i don't think anyone wants to hear it
[11442.18s -> 11443.54s]  they're bored of it they've moved on
[11457.36s -> 11461.60s]  i'm what why i have to put this ammo down i need it
[11464.42s -> 11469.97s]  yeah good what what a lot of shame why am i a coward i literally just was like hey let's
[11469.97s -> 11487.18s]  talk about when we pooped our pants before oh yeah when overwatch 2 beta was out i almost
[11487.18s -> 11492.14s]  did it again with stripping did you realize it was really close i really thought it was
[11492.14s -> 11495.66s]  gonna happen again but i i guess i've grown a little over the years it's good to have like
[11495.66s -> 11503.18s]  markers for yourself at least that milestone well the worst part the worst part is when you
[11503.18s -> 11506.78s]  are like oh hey guys be right back i gotta uh i gotta call my mom or something right and you
[11506.78s -> 11511.74s]  go to another room and you just you just make sure that like nobody can see or hear you and
[11511.74s -> 11517.18s]  it's just like you just go for it and somebody ends up it's so long it's like a you know what
[11517.18s -> 11521.10s]  let's just can we talk about the bible instead you know what i mean like i think it's probably a
[11521.10s -> 11526.96s]  better topic who's your favorite apostle this look i love with the way this place looks
[11530.40s -> 11535.04s]  this is great i love these big chains with the spikes on them yeah oh you can pull this
[11535.04s -> 11539.68s]  oh wow that one is that stung that's sharp one of the uh there's one of the halo like
[11539.68s -> 11554.42s]  skulls up there you gotta get oh yeah i like this tractor get in here these two star missions just
[11554.42s -> 11560.58s]  yeah just like nice yeah they're definitely compared to the three star they feel like
[11560.58s -> 11563.70s]  kraken kraken i'm over here for a sec just back here for one sec
[11564.78s -> 11567.74s]  uh did you tell anybody else about what you hold on
[11574.03s -> 11580.19s]  i said what okay you know what never mind they detect conversations they don't want it i was
[11580.19s -> 11586.11s]  i'd never mind conversation that's not okay okay so i was gonna make a thing where you oh you took
[11586.11s -> 11591.15s]  that crafting material and didn't say anything but never mind we can't even make the joke yeah
[11591.15s -> 11606.99s]  they're also shared between everyone so oh okay well nice good pickup do a backflip holy
[11606.99s -> 11618.85s]  shit he did it oh we can just get to the elevator right yes watch for flankers nice man thanks man
[11622.88s -> 11629.54s]  josh your character looks cool yeah i mean i i got the uh the pre-order armor what the hell was that
[11633.23s -> 11637.15s]  that's the special center and sharpshooter thing that you can do where you like trip all of the
[11637.15s -> 11650.14s]  guys that would be so funny is it a big uh slug guy just a lot of little guys
[11670.21s -> 11678.46s]  oh my goodness sorry oh my god i thought you were a bad guy again well no friendly fire thank you
[11678.46s -> 11688.00s]  i wonder if that's gonna be a modifier oh yeah yeah i mean my feeling is that they had friendly
[11688.00s -> 11691.60s]  fire at one point and then after testing they're like this is actually not fun and really hard
[11691.60s -> 11696.08s]  so they decide not to especially when you like have different size characters that look like
[11696.88s -> 11701.84s]  yeah it's just easy to go they climb we're getting separated we're getting very separated
[11703.36s -> 11710.51s]  all right that guy oh this is the beat there was a charger guy but he couldn't climb the ladder
[11710.51s -> 11717.52s]  oh what that's the guy that's what the guy was just talking about like as you're saying he
[11717.52s -> 11735.62s]  couldn't climb the ladder i see him running up the stairs jesus oh we got a hack oh another one
[11735.62s -> 11759.79s]  that's pretty crazy how big the jump is from two to three yeah this is it gets even like three to
[11759.79s -> 11766.03s]  four and four and five are kind of similar in my opinion but uh just no room for error so is the
[11766.03s -> 11773.92s]  jump from three to four as big as the jump from two to three close yeah i'd say three to four
[11774.88s -> 11780.45s]  yeah it's probably two to three is big three to four is bigger and then four to five is just like
[11781.57s -> 11787.33s]  how would you even as hard as that was for us to do that three on that mission i can't even imagine
[11787.33s -> 11793.82s]  that on a five it's it's really about like positioning communication like there's just
[11793.82s -> 11798.54s]  constant board so you have to like you know auger in front with the shield like you know
[11798.94s -> 11805.74s]  the flamers constantly burning that around um and then like the marksman has to be sniping the
[11805.74s -> 11810.38s]  specials so it's like you just got to be on top of your game and everyone has like a very specific
[11810.38s -> 11816.06s]  role you kind of comp rather than just doing whatever you want yeah it's just that was just
[11816.06s -> 11829.06s]  tons of communication when it works it feels so good it's really really rewarding you also get
[11830.02s -> 11834.43s]  you get like two to three times the rewards that we're getting right now
[11834.43s -> 11837.07s]  just even if you fail just like getting farther
[11839.55s -> 11844.99s]  so really even if you fail it yeah yeah you get rewards for fail oh i just got launched
[11844.99s -> 11847.95s]  wait i'm alive holy shit how do i get back up there oh you're good
[11849.55s -> 11852.91s]  oh there's a trapper between me and you guys though i think we can run down there
[11852.91s -> 11861.82s]  it's actually a good idea okay i got it wow that was lucky but yeah i was gonna say i feel like
[11861.82s -> 11867.82s]  these uh developers have figured like the proper sequel to the like left for dead formula by like
[11867.82s -> 11872.86s]  adding all these objectives and things like that felt like for a long time nobody could figure out
[11872.86s -> 11878.46s]  how to how to do how to develop the yeah the genre any further i agree and it's yeah this
[11878.46s -> 11885.18s]  feels like a i i also like it's a weird take i guess that um it did launch with a lot less
[11885.18s -> 11889.74s]  content than vermintide has but i kind of like that because it gives longevity to the game it's
[11889.74s -> 11893.74s]  not like we just oh we played it we're done it's like it there's a lot of stuff to look forward
[11893.74s -> 11899.10s]  it's like the game is still fun and enjoyable like just like how we beat it it was more focused on
[11899.10s -> 11905.18s]  like polishing the gameplay loop than it was just like jam packing it full of well the thing is
[11905.18s -> 11914.06s]  people have tried to do that formula for a long time people have really tried i can't think of
[11914.06s -> 11921.28s]  anything i mean this is probably i mean i don't sponsor stream but i've honestly that
[11922.40s -> 11926.08s]  this feels the most fun to play out of any of the other games that are in this category
[11926.08s -> 11934.58s]  that i played in a long time yeah this is people shooting over there there he comes
[11945.73s -> 11959.44s]  flame oh my that's a lot of people right here a lot of gunners at the bridges now we gotta go
[11959.44s -> 11969.97s]  restart it again oh my god how did you get up there oh my goodness i just destroyed that guy
[11970.53s -> 11990.06s]  that was so cool too you didn't even know that was happening either don't knock me off
[11990.78s -> 12001.82s]  took a while for vermintide to get to where all the content has yeah they did like regular updates
[12001.82s -> 12005.34s]  for a long time and they added like sub classes and everything that's what i'm looking forward
[12005.34s -> 12009.50s]  to is like there's definitely going to be sub classes for each of these so if you're like i
[12009.50s -> 12015.02s]  want to be you know like an auger and that's all melee based versus like all you know protection
[12015.02s -> 12021.74s]  based probably eventually yeah i want to be i want to be a rep pallie yeah it's kind of what
[12021.74s -> 12028.38s]  sell it is oh i have no idea what a rep pallie is but i hear people say it a lot i just want to be
[12028.38s -> 12043.06s]  clear oh i got down okay one sub class added per quarter so all four should come into a sub class
[12043.06s -> 12051.22s]  in a year i saw something earlier uh somebody said why does nobody play the like psychic class
[12052.34s -> 12059.38s]  oh they do do they i think yeah i've seen a few people the consensus i've heard is that the
[12059.38s -> 12064.18s]  psycher is like kind of annoying to level but at late game it's like maybe the most damage in the
[12064.18s -> 12068.42s]  game like you yeah i've been hearing that a lot that like until you get to level 10 you have like
[12068.42s -> 12078.14s]  nothing to do yeah it was like yeah oh that was the end of level yeah this is just a quick little
[12078.14s -> 12093.38s]  two that was the two we'll do that let's do two i mean uh three sorry level up oh
[12094.26s -> 12108.51s]  jimmy what's your workout routine germa i'm not i don't want to show my armpits i got the shield
[12108.51s -> 12121.12s]  finally nice oh you do nice yeah nice and you can place that too right a new gray shovel
[12121.84s -> 12135.81s]  dude we've seen them at their worst why do you care yeah you've seen your pits at their worst
[12135.81s -> 12148.29s]  yeah i don't know dude i have a weird stream let me try this new gun i mean i'll take a look at
[12148.29s -> 12161.09s]  them after the stream is a sword now oh like dude what a sick shovel oh my god this shovel was
[12161.17s -> 12170.93s]  forged by the gods i got a blue sword and get a new bolt gun i feel like having these new feats
[12172.06s -> 12177.26s]  make it like it changes it's what i'm reading right now is literally changing everything about
[12177.26s -> 12183.46s]  this character like this that's what i mean like everything is is huge for the game and also when
[12183.46s -> 12187.38s]  you hit level 10 that's when you start getting like uh the armor you'll show you new weapons
[12187.38s -> 12193.58s]  that are class specific so if you uh i mean it just feels like it opens up a lot of new stuff
[12193.58s -> 12203.30s]  that you can do plus 50 melee damage and plus 50 damage reduction to these uh different um
[12203.30s -> 12210.18s]  enemies that seems kind of insane 50 more damage melee damage to these different enemies
[12210.18s -> 12216.93s]  Jeremy you should do a stream where you swim in the open ocean with sharks and see what makes them
[12216.93s -> 12237.92s]  tick uh i don't that's not a good idea what is this one so the ball the grenades actually explode
[12237.92s -> 12242.16s]  now i actually have grenades that blow up now and it's not just a box just throwing an empty box
[12242.56s -> 12246.56s]  yeah yeah i think i saw some there's like a cluster grenade thing for the
[12247.92s -> 12252.00s]  i think it the way it works is if you throw the box and it hits a piece of armor then it
[12252.00s -> 12258.56s]  turns into a cluster bomb and explodes i feel like i can't i have to take this though this is
[12258.56s -> 12269.34s]  it's just so it's that's so much more help all right cool i also regenerate your grenades
[12269.98s -> 12275.09s]  you do uh yeah if you're like near me there's like a five percent chance on every kill that
[12275.09s -> 12288.74s]  you get a grenade really that's cool yeah man that's synergy bro yeah bro oh on a lean enemy
[12288.74s -> 12295.26s]  kill never mind it's only elites but still chance chance for grenade all right what about money what
[12295.26s -> 12303.23s]  about weapons i need you know what i want a big chunky two-hander that's what i want can i do
[12303.23s -> 12308.78s]  is that in the game have you guys unlocked the uh yeah it's definitely in the game have you guys
[12308.78s -> 12318.29s]  unlocked the um weekly reward stuff the contracts that's 11 of them oh shit okay not quite a little
[12318.29s -> 12336.82s]  further let's go to the store oh there's one here but i can't afford it yes i can uh break
[12336.82s -> 12341.38s]  down weapons you have right you aren't using to get a little more money right that's true
[12342.34s -> 12352.13s]  is that the best thing to do with the low level ones right just breaking down yeah did you say
[12352.13s -> 12356.77s]  that a gray can actually be pretty good what's the number that i should really be looking at just like
[12356.77s -> 12365.38s]  the item level it's it's it's hard to say it's hard basically if uh if there's an a weapon you
[12365.38s -> 12373.44s]  really like using and you see a gray version of it that's new in the store picking it up is usually
[12373.44s -> 12379.66s]  good because you can then upgrade it and it'll become higher level than the other stuff interesting
[12379.66s -> 12385.98s]  but once you start leveling further then you're just gonna surpass it again so yeah i would
[12385.98s -> 12390.78s]  figure at your current level just like try out new weapons yeah see what see what like what weapon
[12390.78s -> 12397.10s]  style you prefer because yeah you're just gonna out level most of this stuff eventually anyways
[12397.10s -> 12414.48s]  okay well i definitely want to buy that all right i'm gonna be shield what slot is it in
[12414.48s -> 12431.31s]  oh it's the melee slot well that's not i need to change my feet then actually no that's still
[12431.31s -> 12446.66s]  all right wait you get a club oh okay so it's it's a combo oh battle mall and slab i see all right
[12446.66s -> 12463.78s]  cool keep it on all right fun basically you guys want to go for three oh baby a triple let's do
[12463.78s -> 12473.09s]  three wait a minute hold on i could probably upgrade that shield and mace because it's a
[12473.09s -> 12480.16s]  green i could probably turn it into a blue there's a low intensity zone good there's a low intensity
[12480.16s -> 12486.94s]  three low intensity three with grim wars oh that's perfect let's do that i think it means there's
[12486.94s -> 12493.92s]  more uh wait do you need time to upgrade germa are you good i i'll probably try it just to make sure
[12493.92s -> 12507.49s]  i like it okay no it says expect it's like yeah low intensity i think means more specials less
[12507.49s -> 12514.64s]  words i don't know why it's called low intensity or maybe it's less rewards because of the modifier
[12514.72s -> 12519.89s]  i don't know less reward it had a line at the end and i i read it three times but i'm like
[12521.25s -> 12525.57s]  i didn't understand yourself not to compare to another game too much but like the way deep rock
[12525.57s -> 12530.77s]  kind of does like the the level complexity in addition to the difficulty level maybe
[12530.77s -> 12537.65s]  maybe that's what it is like how many like certain types of enemies spawn then i'm gonna put on my
[12537.65s -> 12541.17s]  charge gun i guess there's not really the random generation
[12560.77s -> 12564.61s]  i'm considering buying the game but i don't have a squad of people to play with would i be okay just
[12564.61s -> 12570.37s]  playing by myself yeah i mean i've been playing it a little bit off like solo and you know you'll
[12570.37s -> 12577.82s]  run into the issue of on higher difficulties you got to really one and two you can survive just
[12578.54s -> 12584.54s]  yeah level one and two is good to start learning in solo queues uh three and up
[12585.52s -> 12588.64s]  until you get leveled up a bit more you probably don't want to queue into also because
[12589.92s -> 12593.28s]  right now i don't think there's any restriction like you can be like level three and queue into
[12593.28s -> 12599.68s]  a tier three and yeah everyone will be like mad at you and then you'll die and that's not very
[12599.68s -> 12611.18s]  fun um yeah it seems like because i think the reason why playing solo in some of the games
[12611.18s -> 12618.66s]  maybe is i don't there's no bots right it just you just queue up with people yeah it'll fill in
[12618.66s -> 12623.14s]  bots if somebody leaves admission but then it'll refill them like usually with another person
[12623.14s -> 12629.44s]  but you can you start a game with bots i don't know i think it'll try to matchmake i think the
[12629.44s -> 12633.28s]  bots are only there if there's like no one that happened to be yeah like matchmaking at your
[12633.28s -> 12638.00s]  current i think you can start it with bots but then if people join in progress they'll just take over
[12638.80s -> 12643.84s]  and they definitely have bots in the game so it's possible they could you know change that later
[12652.80s -> 12656.46s]  oh that's fun are you liking the shield yeah
[12657.26s -> 12661.46s]  but can you i think that's the first big upgrade for you yeah you can
[12663.62s -> 12673.39s]  does it use uh stamina when you block with it or is it just full immunity to bullets
[12674.03s -> 12679.95s]  i think it eats stamina when it gets hit you also have a thing though where you can deploy it like
[12679.95s -> 12685.23s]  put on the ground yeah i wonder how you do that and it blocks infinitely it might be the alternate
[12685.23s -> 12692.43s]  attack or alternate move um oh yep you can test it if you want but it's really fun if you like
[12692.43s -> 12700.43s]  put it in a there you go like that now now how do i get to shoot around you really they won't
[12701.44s -> 12707.12s]  like oh this will block everything whoa that's cool so if we like get to a doorway and you just
[12707.12s -> 12716.46s]  drop that let's go boom then everybody can just play yeah that's fun yeah let my friends play
[12716.46s -> 12720.46s]  yeah yeah i give me way less responsibility so i can just enjoy like enjoy you guys like beating
[12720.46s -> 12727.84s]  stuff i mean i think it's pretty like necessary in the higher difficulties to have an aggro because
[12727.84s -> 12739.63s]  like sniper you you become the oh yeah choke point sniper really sniper huh he's never gonna
[12739.63s -> 12744.82s]  stop holding the shield up now something else to the left of the head i think
[12753.81s -> 12757.01s]  oh what's that a fire person yeah i don't think you can block fire
[12774.03s -> 12780.83s]  so bad i'll make a loss so bad whatever whatever yeah betty never even get himself playing this
[12786.10s -> 12788.26s]  there's two of them oh there's another one okay

[13110.80s -> 13117.68s]  strippin's build with that same audren shield is you can get an enchant on your mace so that
[13117.68s -> 13125.30s]  whenever you hit with it it gives you 14 toughness back like your shield oh so you can like actually
[13125.30s -> 13133.28s]  tank really well actually really like this chain sword nice i thought it was gonna like take ammo
[13133.28s -> 13139.04s]  or something wait till you get the power sword that's apparently the best weapon in the game
[13140.30s -> 13146.08s]  oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit that was a bad move
[13147.68s -> 13165.95s]  i got it wait what yeah the timing's a little funky on that sometimes
[13172.45s -> 13175.01s]  it robbed me oh careful gunners
[13186.11s -> 13202.53s]  all right good it's chainsword only for veteran uh we get a double two-handed chain sword as

[13296.16s -> 13304.21s]  fire oh yeah that's right i forgot good call and a bomber somewhere right there actually the
[13304.21s -> 13324.35s]  burster oh my my gun is way too inaccurate i can't hit him from that far away elementary school level
[13324.35s -> 13326.75s]  acting elementary school play level acting
[13329.58s -> 13333.42s]  is that better or worse than ubisoft e3 yeah that's i know that's what i mean
[13334.38s -> 13340.54s]  is he is that about the voice i didn't i don't know i somebody was very rude is being insulted
[13340.54s -> 13346.46s]  so that we can appropriately be upset and engaged true yeah i'm just gonna assume it was me so i feel
[13346.46s -> 13350.70s]  bad with myself that's cool i'm gonna assume it was me i'm also gonna feel bad i think it was
[13350.70s -> 13356.35s]  me so i'm gonna feel bad too all right sounds like a plan by the way i definitely i definitely
[13356.35s -> 13361.79s]  feel way more bad than you guys do no i think i i think i feel worse no i don't know yeah you should
[13363.07s -> 13371.57s]  i feel no i feel awful about it i feel the worst you go up the ladder it's definitely up here
[13371.57s -> 13381.71s]  up here all right yeah 100 what you just took no you just took fall damage and you were making
[13381.71s -> 13386.83s]  a joke to make me come up here and you're the one that got hurt i did i didn't i heard your guy go
[13388.43s -> 13393.15s]  when he landed it's in character that my guy does like theater level acting
[13395.41s -> 13408.26s]  all right uh josh probably get this feeling the thought is actually kind of funny of like a
[13408.26s -> 13412.58s]  middle school play being put on and it's just like a ubisoft e3 trailer reveal like they all
[13413.38s -> 13422.62s]  oh what's that oh boy get me back in here get back in here oh god trapper oh that was close

[14062.80s -> 14069.68s]  yeah and it is it's basically you're firing explosive like red bull cans of people
[14071.54s -> 14078.43s]  red bull cans yeah okay see if i can get one you guys good for another one there's one more
[14078.99s -> 14086.90s]  you can do one more sure i'll be playing all night i think either way yeah yeah i have to uh i have to
[14086.90s -> 14090.66s]  just get out of here uh pretty soon i gotta go over get ready to fly an airplane
[14091.60s -> 14100.75s]  oh yeah you are doing that tomorrow should be pretty interesting oh there's another cut scene
[14100.75s -> 14107.55s]  oh yeah watch it how familiar are you with the concept of flying like what you have to do
[14108.83s -> 14114.75s]  i mean i've played uh microsoft flight simulator because it was free on game pass i played it for
[14114.75s -> 14118.54s]  like 10 minutes
[14120.46s -> 14125.09s]  we'll see
[14138.53s -> 14144.80s]  you did a five terabyte install to play for 10 minutes that's actually that's actually kind of
[14144.80s -> 14153.58s]  true you should memorize something really specific to impress austin yeah don't worry i'm gonna make
[14153.58s -> 14159.50s]  sure i go in there with a bunch of language in lingo i'm gonna know i don't worry oh it was an
[14159.50s -> 14167.41s]  emperor's grip i did get a bolt gun cool sick and it's actually really freaking good thank you
[14167.41s -> 14180.61s]  emperor praise be praise be praise be did i get anything new got this a while ago okay
[14181.95s -> 14189.79s]  i'm gonna spend my gamble currency oh you're gonna gamble give me a new knife oh my god it's
[14189.79s -> 14197.95s]  another axe i'm gonna fucking cry give me a new knife oh my god it's another fucking axe
[14197.95s -> 14204.19s]  every time i i've literally rolled 12 times with this and it's only been axes and it's my least
[14204.19s -> 14209.39s]  favorite weapon i think that's a sign from the emperor he wants you to use the axe i will not
[14210.50s -> 14216.58s]  i hate it i didn't even look and the weapon that i really wanted was available i didn't even look
[14216.58s -> 14228.18s]  so uh curios do those just uh those just appear at random or can you buy those too
[14228.90s -> 14238.16s]  you buy them i think i have this a lot but i don't have any yet i'm ready i'm gonna hold on to this
[14239.12s -> 14247.42s]  yeah hold on everything okay so what's the what do you want to do for one more with this particular
[14247.42s -> 14255.95s]  group and by all means if you guys keep playing keep playing hmm one more chill zone one or two
[14257.47s -> 14264.26s]  now let's do a three yeah you know what let's go let's go high intensity engagement zone
[14264.98s -> 14274.58s]  or now fuck that we'll do this one this one's really good ending i'm really close to some drops
[14276.64s -> 14280.08s]  yeah good you'll get it it's different this is gonna take definitely more than 15 20 minutes
[14285.18s -> 14292.00s]  go for a four i don't think we're ready for yeah i don't know i mean we could try but it
[14292.00s -> 14296.64s]  doesn't want to try getting destroyed i mean do you want to go out on a four and just see how badly
[14296.64s -> 14302.21s]  we get just absolutely decimated let's try it depends if you want to finish or not too late
[14302.21s -> 14311.06s]  all right well we're good let's do what we know what we know we know what to do i think a four
[14311.06s -> 14316.58s]  would be hard for an 11 and an eight i think you'd need at least yeah like a 15 to 20
[14320.26s -> 14323.06s]  yeah i'm trying out a new outfit i think i look pretty good
[14324.66s -> 14331.42s]  wait are you using pajamas and then like a little hat it's unfortunate that the uh you know it is
[14331.42s -> 14336.46s]  like a prison necklace i i want it to be an ascot but maybe when i get to level 30 and they free me
[14336.46s -> 14342.14s]  i i was gonna say it looks like an ascot so it it plays you know yeah i think i look good in it
[14342.14s -> 14348.98s]  for it being actual prisoner arm like a tire i think i pull it off yeah you definitely
[14350.22s -> 14356.02s]  just realized something really really important people have not been able to see how much ammo i've
[14356.02s -> 14365.84s]  had the entire stream i mean it's not like they're playing oh dude they said stop
[14365.84s -> 14372.48s]  shut up like you haven't done that before stop they couldn't even see yeah they couldn't even
[14372.48s -> 14377.92s]  tell how can they follow the action you thought you did that a month ago i saw it shut up
[14379.26s -> 14382.54s]  like you've never done that before bro
[14388.53s -> 14396.29s]  whatever come on focus up focus up forget about the ammo oh i got my bolt gun yeah what
[14407.15s -> 14413.49s]  uh do you know what the like special ability on the sword is is it like a parry yeah yeah okay
[14414.29s -> 14419.49s]  it uses some stamina when you hit back when you block that'd be such an awful way to go
[14421.26s -> 14425.66s]  just four people just smashing you just smushing your head with different like big blunt objects
[14425.66s -> 14444.59s]  and swords and stuff holy shit this gun is insane behind me behind behind behind behind all right
[14444.59s -> 14453.94s]  now move forward big guy that kind of makes me feel bad like how am i going to use other guns
[14454.50s -> 14459.46s]  yeah once you start using the bolter it's the reason i don't use it is it's uh just so slow
[14459.46s -> 14465.06s]  behind like load and get set up that i i like the slow gun the other guns and yeah the
[14465.06s -> 14469.78s]  bolter is definitely going to be compared to the plasma gun this thing like aoe god
[14469.78s -> 14484.24s]  uh i would get behind me i come up like turkey geez i feel a little inaccurate there's all oh
[14484.24s -> 14495.22s]  my god stay behind me oh dog oh my dog they did it again where's this fucking dog he jumped up
[14495.78s -> 14512.24s]  oh that guy's a scream wait maybe i mean i would i would feel that way too i just turn around and
[14512.24s -> 14524.67s]  see these fucking guys running towards me with a knife i think if i get like a really good uh
[14529.17s -> 14562.14s]  never mind oh trapped oh man oh i am i'm dead i went from 100 to zero that is so many
[14562.14s -> 14568.75s]  yeah i might just not have enough damage at this level but i don't know it's hard to tell
[14570.78s -> 14576.14s]  we're good i'm good yeah hey the armored guys what's the strategy on the uh the fully armored
[14576.38s -> 14584.14s]  um just dodge primarily because they wind up i just found out you can't really dodge backwards
[14584.14s -> 14590.54s]  does it like it goes in a line yeah yeah i keep having that problem style is there a particular
[14590.54s -> 14594.70s]  weak point on those guys too or not not their heads weirdly enough i always dodge backwards
[14594.70s -> 14603.47s]  and i get hit every time problem is like i go to shooting head but good to know yeah they're all
[14603.47s -> 14608.83s]  armored but their head is the most armored apparently um they're kind of a bastard but
[14609.87s -> 14616.83s]  i have like a bleed build so i just hit them a few times and they that stacks and die anyway so
[14618.90s -> 14626.00s]  for bolters we're fucking up too filters are like a huge ammo piercing
[14629.81s -> 14635.81s]  is the uh chainsword good for armor or bad um it's good if you rev it otherwise
[14635.89s -> 14641.97s]  that's what i mean i'm gonna stop swearing when you read it it does uh
[14642.93s -> 14660.46s]  they give me my arab armor piercing armor piercing this it is a grimoire look it's like in the
[14660.46s -> 14670.67s]  fucking uh inside the thingy that's weird do you think this is cool or hot this this is probably
[14670.67s -> 14675.71s]  minty fresh i'm thinking like spearmint chili do you think it's like a like 50 degrees 60 degrees
[14676.67s -> 14679.63s]  yeah it makes it look like a numbing sensation that's why i think it's uh
[14680.27s -> 14690.38s]  like the gas form of nickelodeon gas oh i wonder what that would be like heated up to the point
[14690.38s -> 14697.42s]  that it's gaseous yo it heals you oh shit so when katie perry got like a face full that one time
[14699.23s -> 14707.28s]  the uh you guys remember floam loam was where it is that loam way better than gack
[14708.08s -> 14718.16s]  yeah everyone's like oh gack remember gack gack was dog shit okay floam was way better i think
[14718.16s -> 14725.68s]  this sniper floam it was this had like little beads in it it was this squishy like yeah it's
[14725.68s -> 14737.15s]  hard to describe dots you ever had dipping dots yeah there's another heal up here it's the ice
[14737.15s -> 14742.30s]  cream of the future there's a station up here this with one more in it well we can't climb

[15901.57s -> 15907.49s]  not the motive the note is wrong no it's just there's music playing in both my ears and i can't
[15907.49s -> 15918.05s]  talk when it happens what music does all the soundtrack i get speech jammed when this
[15918.05s -> 15925.70s]  sounds going to both ears talked about it many times this game is very overwhelming when like
[15925.70s -> 15942.75s]  everything's rushing at you that's really cute like funny little quirk oh boy all right check
[15942.75s -> 15955.30s]  the store see if you get anything cool that's right what's new anything good oh shit there's
[15955.30s -> 15968.69s]  a fucking 300 power diaper oh i'm so mad that was on camera and i'm taking this too are you
[15968.69s -> 15986.26s]  shitting me in this diaper yeah i can finally get a curio oh yeah that's so much man i hate it
[15986.26s -> 15992.90s]  when i hear things with both my ears at the same time you know for all the shit talkers out there
[15992.90s -> 15998.93s]  i'm just telling you when there when i have both of my ears blocked with it doesn't matter what it
[15998.93s -> 16007.36s]  is if i cannot hear myself talking completely without any filter on it it causes it just makes
[16007.36s -> 16012.08s]  it it's like muffled it's weird and i can't talk correctly i have to be able to hear myself talk
[16012.08s -> 16017.86s]  i have to be able to hear the ambience of the room i've i've known you for a long time and
[16017.86s -> 16019.78s]  i can confirm you do need to hear yourself talk
[16028.69s -> 16037.97s]  i reached through the monitor and strangled that was pretty good that was pretty good
[16038.77s -> 16044.24s]  i'll let you have that one okay i i have officially been allowed to have one
[16044.24s -> 16053.46s]  hey craig can you know what the uh like the primary action and secondary action numbers
[16053.46s -> 16061.60s]  mean on like a gun like on a laze gun i'm so roasted i don't know what to do anymore
[16061.60s -> 16067.95s]  uh primary action is i think like hip fire and then secondary is like aiming down the sights
[16067.95s -> 16072.19s]  i'm trying to figure out like the numbers are pure damage or what they yeah for the okay
[16072.19s -> 16078.51s]  for the knife for example light attack is a slash for my dagger and a heavy attack is is pierce and
[16078.51s -> 16088.30s]  it's a heavy that's the heavy attack okay i think yeah so crowd control means what exactly so the
[16088.30s -> 16093.38s]  shield has 40 this one i have 47 percent crowd control is that how far back you knock them back
[16093.38s -> 16113.90s]  when you push them what is crowd control all right um so it's when it's knockback so it's how
[16113.90s -> 16122.64s]  much knockback it is okay that's cool i need an opinion from criken sure oh there we go it shows
[16122.64s -> 16129.68s]  on when you inspect it'll show a crowd before level 30 or like really high item gear is it a
[16129.68s -> 16136.43s]  total waste to use any of my cubes for like the requisition stuff i would i would save the cubes
[16136.43s -> 16146.85s]  for 30 yeah but i would use the oh no wall what's the other stuff the requisition man
[16146.85s -> 16153.41s]  you can use the like the little pringles can looking things yeah but not i was i'd save the
[16153.41s -> 16160.30s]  cubes yeah germa's right there on that screen you were on um yeah crowd control and defensive
[16160.30s -> 16166.56s]  and like kind of describes what so that you can actually go look at all the this the weapon like
[16166.56s -> 16174.10s]  the details of the weapon like this 80s yeah there's a full you guys know this that's that's
[16174.10s -> 16178.42s]  a lot more info than i really i don't think that was in the in the beta was this is a full breakdown
[16178.42s -> 16185.25s]  of literally every single aspect of this whole weapon damage and stagger heavy attacks special
[16185.25s -> 16193.71s]  actions oh the guy crashed the game no that's really cool though well it's perfect timing
[16193.71s -> 16201.23s]  too much knowledge profane too much info yes that's one way to get out of trying to a level four
[16201.23s -> 16214.72s]  do you want to try a level four we want to try level four yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure
[16215.28s -> 16219.92s]  okay my confidence is growing my confidence is growing i think we can do it look at i'm growing
[16219.92s -> 16228.42s]  my confidence level level four should we do level four let's freaking do it do it oh but i don't
[16228.42s -> 16232.82s]  know if i have enough time i don't what if we're not good enough what if we can't do it well if we
[16232.82s -> 16238.30s]  can't do it then you'll die early what if i don't have enough damage then you just use your big
[16238.30s -> 16242.98s]  shield what if i say something stupid and people don't think it's funny oh i can't help with that
[16242.98s -> 16254.91s]  what if you guys never talk to me again i wasn't planning on it oh i went to the meat grinder and
[16254.91s -> 16264.30s]  it kicked me from the group you guys really do you actually i mean i left do you guys really
[16264.30s -> 16268.22s]  want to go forward or do we just you know let's go for it all right fine let's do it we might not
[16268.22s -> 16271.90s]  survive an entire round but we can definitely try why not what it's like let's go for it shouldn't
[16271.90s -> 16276.06s]  take long no it's going to take probably five we'll find out one way or the other really quickly
[16276.06s -> 16289.26s]  yeah let me just get back in again another moment why that's why what's going on people
[16289.26s -> 16298.19s]  are making moments here can anybody in chat make a moment or does it have to be a mod just the mods
[16298.19s -> 16304.86s]  i think you get five a month so you might as well use them right might as well you only get five
[16304.86s -> 16311.39s]  moments a month what if you had more moments and i you i thought i used them all for the year or
[16311.39s -> 16317.31s]  something didn't i make all the ones that month in like one stream oh the longest stream or whatever
[16317.31s -> 16320.83s]  if you have more than five moments in a month they're not really moments they're not special
[16320.83s -> 16327.84s]  enough oh we had like 30 month no you didn't yeah i noticed that there's not i only had one
[16327.84s -> 16333.70s]  moment from your stream this uh last couple months i don't know did it very much happen i don't know
[16334.50s -> 16339.12s]  um it's out of notification we have one new moment from stirs channel i was just like oh
[16339.84s -> 16345.04s]  i don't think i've ever made a moment in a while it is the 41st and uh i i'm sorry that i burned
[16345.04s -> 16352.91s]  you so bad earlier i i apologize you know i know you're trying to get back i'm trying to get back
[16353.39s -> 16364.86s]  i'm trying to get back in what do you got going on stir i have going on what do you got going on um
[16365.74s -> 16376.18s]  well my life is totally derailed um i just have myriad is all i have what only thing in my life
[16376.18s -> 16381.46s]  what is myriad i have nothing else what is the myriad myriad is my tabletop game that kraken
[16381.46s -> 16387.78s]  played in a while ago and it takes a lot of work to make and stuff so not much has been going on
[16387.78s -> 16391.94s]  because it is the uh holiday times and all of my players are doing other things
[16392.82s -> 16398.32s]  and where can they find this uh this game uh the myriad is uh tabletop streams on my channel on
[16398.32s -> 16406.38s]  twitch tv slash stir is that stir like uh like the star or with an e s t e r so like stare it's
[16406.38s -> 16412.46s]  pretty cool i don't why do why do people pronounce that stare why doesn't he suddenly get an a
[16413.26s -> 16416.62s]  let's start with an e at the end right no no s t e r
[16423.58s -> 16427.26s]  do we want me to make the party you want to throw some invites around three logs i went to the meat
[16427.26s -> 16433.30s]  grinder like a fool so you can make the party again i will just throw out invites are we all
[16433.30s -> 16442.51s]  in the game uh yeah i'm still in do i need to leave the existing party uh probably i would say
[16442.59s -> 16456.78s]  it leaves strike team okay there's the old smush there you are i can invite you here
[16458.08s -> 16467.28s]  and then stir all right let's try level four let's do it up all right so i like to hear
[16468.00s -> 16475.52s]  our options are that one's pretty straightforward well it's the only four so i guess that's what
[16475.52s -> 16483.36s]  we're doing that's the one we're doing all right so if we're going to lose in in literally five
[16485.26s -> 16492.67s]  uh it's always an option reagan what do you got going on um honestly i've just been playing
[16492.67s -> 16499.33s]  a lot of dark tide a lot of uh what else i've been playing played wow the expansion launch
[16499.97s -> 16504.53s]  yeah dragon flight someone my friend playing that is it any good looks actually entertaining
[16504.53s -> 16508.13s]  i'm not even a wow player it's yeah it's been the most fun i've had with a launch
[16508.13s -> 16514.53s]  of wow since like for many years the thing that i was surprised was the uh how fast the dragons
[16514.53s -> 16522.13s]  fly yeah it feels like the first expansion where blizzarded like values the player's time
[16522.13s -> 16528.13s]  which is saying something so it doesn't feel like you're made to do a really repetitive
[16528.13s -> 16533.89s]  shit over and over again every single day to stay you know like did you did you like legion
[16534.94s -> 16539.10s]  yeah i think legion's my favorite i think that's the best state the game that was ever in i so this
[16539.10s -> 16544.14s]  is honestly this feels like the most like legion since uh really yeah in terms of uh
[16544.94s -> 16548.24s]  in terms of just like what the start of the expansion feels like really okay
[16555.98s -> 16561.82s]  put two headphones in for this oh boy two headphones you're gonna hear yourself that's
[16561.82s -> 16579.86s]  how you know we're getting serious godspeed everyone you'll notice things take a little
[16579.86s -> 16590.13s]  bit longer to kill and we don't have more ammo do we no we don't anything we might have less
[16590.13s -> 16595.17s]  ammo i think i know why this gun has so much higher damage it's slower firing but it might
[16595.17s -> 16644.64s]  be better oh that would be horrible ranger oh all right archman why is it being so weird
[16645.44s -> 16672.53s]  what did i do where's this guy going he just walked into the fire it's this guy i walked right
[16672.53s -> 16685.15s]  by him he's hiding in there he's always a weird person i mean am i always weird i don't think it's
[16685.15s -> 16717.31s]  always holy shit you know what to do yeah i'll hear yeah you hold there i'll just cut there are
[16717.31s -> 16722.83s]  so there are there are many gunners all right that's more people than i've ever seen in this
[16722.83s -> 16729.07s]  whole game yeah they like exponentially increase holy shit i couldn't stop that guy i couldn't
[16729.07s -> 16756.22s]  stop that guy oh my god what the fuck get out of my way dude we can't even fit in this right
[16756.22s -> 16768.72s]  just spit all over my computer they can't even dude what the fuck doing fine is the
[16768.72s -> 16771.76s]  gunner in here with us now all right back it up back it up back it up back it up
[16772.72s -> 16779.22s]  is that big guy in the corner alive or dead okay that's that's turbo no no there's one
[16779.22s -> 16788.96s]  like in the corner looking at the wall that guy this gunner this they're all on the stairs too
[16789.68s -> 16806.85s]  i'm going in yeah i'm i'm actually really surprised we lived through that
[16808.08s -> 16811.92s]  yeah it's just like he's got a coordinate a lot better i haven't been paying attention
[16811.92s -> 16815.52s]  at all i forgot we did a four and i've been like talking to my chat and just like
[16815.52s -> 16824.08s]  and then i saw that like the doorway jam so does it increase the amount of enemies per tier
[16825.04s -> 16833.84s]  uh yes i mean the answer has to be yes there's no way let's get it there's no fucking way
[16839.68s -> 16846.16s]  yeah it makes endless forward i think is the default for four and then also more specials
[16846.88s -> 16858.11s]  so and everyone's got more help yeah this is unbelievable yeah it starts to feel like a
[16858.11s -> 16865.30s]  different game once you like the bomber across the way then once you get good at it like you
[16865.30s -> 16869.89s]  don't want to play anything lower yeah i feel like you end up wasting your time all night
[16870.85s -> 16882.03s]  no it's okay oh boy oh
[16885.49s -> 16887.10s]  i even have like
[16887.74s -> 16897.18s]  everyone to be attacked oh really i mean i'm standing still but all in the back
[16912.06s -> 16926.85s]  i did i guess i did shoot him a lot i don't know dude you're good dude all right let's go
[16928.02s -> 16934.66s]  dude i i think we're doing okay i think we're doing all right the next area is usually pretty
[16934.66s -> 16939.46s]  hard and so i'm worried we might have to like all back into a corner we have healing coming up
[16939.70s -> 16944.18s]  who's taking the grenade and technically we can wait to heal until after the next word in case we
[16944.18s -> 16969.25s]  want to you know save it i i don't why am i getting targeted all right i think i even
[16969.25s -> 16976.74s]  turned that off never mind what'd you do um i died oh that's i thought that was you i died and i blame
[16976.74s -> 16988.70s]  the game all right we'll get you because i uh take a health oh holy shit somebody's doing a
[16988.70s -> 16998.78s]  lot of damage going down oh they hit very hard oh it's sniper it's a sniper
[17000.61s -> 17001.09s]  you can get him
[17007.25s -> 17007.97s]  what the hell
[17011.52s -> 17021.74s]  oh it's gonna be close okay no shit just in time both of us i'll respawn
[17029.42s -> 17033.34s]  oh my god i have no more help i have no help i have no more help
[17034.46s -> 17037.50s]  keep hitting them keep hitting them wait there's a healing station right here
[17039.92s -> 17047.28s]  we're good we're good we're fine okay they're up there uh shall i use it now yeah all right
[17047.28s -> 17055.57s]  let's go get them there are a lot of gunners defending us good to know like three machine
[17055.57s -> 17069.36s]  gunners all right let's not hit it yet we're just gonna just gonna try to get them up first yeah
[17069.36s -> 17086.64s]  that's a good idea they do take a lot of hits now one gunner got away yeah thanks bro all right
[17086.64s -> 17093.28s]  we're good all right thank you all right we'll save the other two healing for after this i have
[17093.28s -> 17099.28s]  a heal kit thing do you want me to put it down now uh let's wait till a little bit into the fight
[17099.28s -> 17101.92s]  and that way we can use it in case we get
[17114.58s -> 17119.14s]  do i shoot through germa if he's like in between yeah there's no friendly fire so
[17119.14s -> 17128.10s]  i just wasn't sure if my bullets would go through yeah to make it clean exit i have an ammo box if
[17128.10s -> 17134.90s]  we need to as well all right let's activate it uh usually i think if germa's here with a shield
[17134.90s -> 17138.18s]  guarding the front there's a lot of gunners usually come from the front and then we watch
[17138.18s -> 17146.02s]  the sides his back all right well shield up you guys snipe the gunners so i'll watch the melee
[17146.02s -> 17164.61s]  and you guys dog he's gone he's gone just keep watching vampire they're approaching
[17165.57s -> 17188.70s]  vampires they're approaching music oh okay they're coming from our right okay do you take over melee
[17189.42s -> 17204.74s]  take the right on the left on the left gunners up
[17208.74s -> 17219.30s]  on our left again left and right where what's going on i got grabbed i got grabbed
[17223.92s -> 17241.01s]  nice all right we got through the thing i'm dead i'm dead i am also dead unfortunately
[17241.01s -> 17250.93s]  what the heck what did i do what did i just do oh shit my knife just barely nicked a uh
[17250.93s -> 17258.21s]  explosive thing and it literally threw me down that's it well it just takes one oopsie oh that
[17258.21s -> 17266.75s]  was that was i got surrounded by ragers i was incredibly unlucky we literally would have had
[17266.75s -> 17273.01s]  it if i didn't pull myself up no i mean we made it further than i thought yeah i thought we were
[17273.01s -> 17277.49s]  gonna die in the first 10 seconds you know like practice i think he's able to get practice makes
[17277.49s -> 17281.57s]  bad but so we're gonna get a okay amount of experience you got level 10 out of that so
[17281.57s -> 17288.00s]  that's not bad oh yeah and again i think 10 is a pretty big power boost generally
[17288.88s -> 17292.96s]  yeah like all the money we just got so that is a lot of money for failing
[17295.89s -> 17302.67s]  so auto guns versus laze guns what do you think is better for laze guns for kicking out elite
[17302.67s -> 17308.26s]  targets auto guns for horde probably openness on the cleave beat helps a lot with tanking
[17308.82s -> 17315.79s]  good to know all right that was fun yeah thank you that was fun yeah thanks for playing everybody
[17315.79s -> 17322.78s]  uh see you guys all probably soon i mean i i think the game's really fun if um maybe i'll
