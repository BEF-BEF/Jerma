[1.46s -> 18.34s]  Hey everybody. How are you? Hi. Don't upset him. That's right. Don't upset me right now.
[20.79s -> 31.72s]  That's not one out of ten. You'll know when it's one out of ten. I'm giving myself a way to relax,
[31.72s -> 38.52s]  you know? I'm giving myself a cutoff, because if it gets, if it happens ten times, then I've,
[38.52s -> 42.44s]  I've got, I'm gonna, I'm going to leave. I'll see, I'll see you later. You know what I mean? Like,
[42.44s -> 48.60s]  you can't, you gotta, you gotta give yourself a, it's not healthy to get angry and then bring it
[48.60s -> 53.40s]  down like 50 times in one day. It's not good for you. It's not good for you. So we'll get a cabinet
[53.40s -> 62.14s]  ten. I got a mold meter. That's right. Oh, by the way, I actually have to change that to two.
[65.43s -> 70.95s]  My coffee got fucked up this morning and I was, I was very upset by it. That's, and then I stubbed
[70.95s -> 78.14s]  my toe coming out of bed and I screamed into the pillow. So, I mean, so that's already two out of
[78.14s -> 89.14s]  ten. Anyways, I want to talk about some stuff before we go forward. I want to talk about last
[89.14s -> 94.62s]  night. I want to talk about the game and I want to talk about some stuff, because that was the
[94.62s -> 100.68s]  first time we even turned that server on. We got a lot to discuss. First thing to discuss is,
[101.56s -> 106.54s]  uh, well, hold on. Let me tweet this first so people know that I'm live and how they know.
[107.50s -> 139.38s]  By the way, where's the, uh, oh, there it is. All right. Let me tweet this beer back. Okay. So last
[139.38s -> 145.78s]  night we did, uh, the Minecraft FTK experiment and it was very much an experiment because
[146.50s -> 152.10s]  none of the systems were in place last night. Uh, there was still some more development time.
[152.10s -> 155.62s]  Thing needed about like another, at least probably four or five days in the oven.
[156.50s -> 160.34s]  And we just said, you know what? Fuck it. Let's just open it up. Let's just essentially make this
[160.34s -> 165.70s]  stress test 2.0, uh, stream was an hour late and we just were like, let's fucking go and there's
[165.70s -> 169.70s]  no permadeath and no systems. Let's just see how many people join and let's just see if we can have
[169.70s -> 176.10s]  any fun. So, uh, it came out undercooked. Yeah, I did. And that was to be expected because we did
[176.10s -> 184.52s]  a stress test the day before, but you, you can never, you can never have that exact experience
[184.52s -> 188.28s]  that you're looking for with like even like a stress test, because if I go in the discord
[188.28s -> 191.40s]  and I'm like, Hey, can we get like a few hundred people to connect to the server? And it's like,
[191.40s -> 199.56s]  all right, yeah, let's go. Uh, times that by like 50 is hard to get that, uh, to get that to work.
[200.36s -> 205.88s]  Time's upset today. I'm not upset. What are you talking about? I had fun last night.
[205.88s -> 210.36s]  I mean, it was, the whole thing was a shit show, but I think that was to be expected at some point,
[210.36s -> 218.12s]  but that was not what that game was going to be. So I have seen a lot of people look, I'm taking
[218.44s -> 223.00s]  the people have been writing about, uh, here's what I didn't like about it. Here's what I would
[223.00s -> 227.88s]  like changed. Yeah. What, what was up with this? What was up with that? I totally hear you. And
[227.88s -> 234.20s]  none of that last night was what the game was supposed to be. So we're going to put it back in
[234.20s -> 241.70s]  the oven for like another week or two and try it again. But the data that was collected yesterday
[243.53s -> 251.24s]  was so important. There's no way we could have ever had any of the data we had last night.
[251.24s -> 254.28s]  Unless we had a shit show last night. You know what I mean? It's almost like you have to take
[254.28s -> 261.46s]  like an arrow to the arm before you're allowed to, you know what I'm saying? Like I sometimes,
[261.46s -> 264.90s]  no, you don't have to take an arrow to the arm. You could just dodge, but just know that the arrows
[264.90s -> 276.04s]  coming, you have to get an arrow shot at you first. Just dodge long story short. Yes. Uh,
[276.04s -> 283.64s]  there's going to be a more time is what we needed. Now let's move on over to jump king.
[284.28s -> 291.13s]  I still had fun last night and I know a lot of people did too. And I know there was some
[291.13s -> 298.86s]  dumb shit that happened last night and it was fun, but that was a glorified stress test too.
[300.92s -> 304.44s]  So don't worry. That was not the game. It's not like, oh, that was it. Okay. Well, that was
[305.08s -> 316.94s]  not what he described. Don't worry. Don't worry. Jump king. There is a smoking hot babe at the top.
[318.04s -> 329.43s]  Okay. So this is a game. Uh, this is a, what is other babes? Was that even here? I don't
[329.43s -> 336.06s]  remember that being here. It's a porn game. New game. All right. So I'll be playing this
[336.06s -> 347.99s]  with the controller or is that a bad idea? No, it's fine. Okay. You've heard the legend too.
[350.26s -> 358.15s]  So you're gonna get that babe, right? Go on then get up there.
[370.65s -> 375.69s]  All right. Is it just jump? You hold the button. Oh yeah. If you, it's like Luigi,
[375.69s -> 383.78s]  does down also do it? So it's just hold button. I get it. All right. So you, it's like,
[384.98s -> 391.27s]  it's like playing pool on it's like a pool video game. You have like a power and then a spot that
[391.27s -> 403.18s]  you move the bar to. Yeah. It's like playing a video game pool. I get it. Yep. The red crown
[403.18s -> 414.12s]  wood. So this is the game because I can't move in the air. Whoa, boy. Okay. So how do I get these
[414.12s -> 426.09s]  ones then? And if I press right, I'm not upset. I'm fine. If I, if I press right, how much does
[426.09s -> 429.69s]  it go right? Does it go all the way? If I like hold and press right, it's okay. It's the whole
[429.69s -> 444.62s]  thing. It just launches you. You can't do a small left or a small right. Okay. This is going to be,
[445.70s -> 452.06s]  oh, this is going to be something. All right, let's go. So I have to go like this. No, like this
[452.86s -> 467.82s]  from here. There it is. This is like the first five seconds of the game. I'm not upset though.
[467.82s -> 478.25s]  You can tell I'm, I'm laughing. That means I'm not upset. Oh, for the love of not upset about
[478.25s -> 492.54s]  anything. I'm just fine. That's not one. Just not that hard. There we go. Okay. So is there
[492.54s -> 512.25s]  checkpoints in this game? She must really be something. No, there's definitely like little
[512.25s -> 528.01s]  safe spots like there are in getting over it. There has to be. It's that once you get it down,
[528.01s -> 538.20s]  you really get it down. All right. I'm thinking probably from back here. Yeah. Okay. Good. What
[538.20s -> 556.22s]  the hell am I looking at here? I have to hit what? Okay. So I've got to get in the middle.
[560.81s -> 577.74s]  Oh, shit. Okay. Now from here, I'm gonna hit my head on the ceiling though. All right. I'm
[577.74s -> 585.26s]  starting to get the hang of it. Don't go too far. Don't go too far. And then let's go.
[586.22s -> 600.79s]  Uh, from here and then hold it down. Let go. All right. Don't hit your head. Good. All right.
[600.79s -> 615.62s]  From here, I got to go. I got to take this very slow. I have to go slow. And then I'm thinking
[615.62s -> 622.95s]  on the left side here. Yeah. It's got to be like this. I might fall here, but it's attempt. It's
[622.95s -> 628.54s]  a good attempt. No, no, I'm not going to fall. What the fuck are you talking about? It's all right.
[640.34s -> 658.42s]  Oh, okay. Easy, easy. Don't get too confident. You're in the middle of the oak tree. Oops.
[658.42s -> 666.10s]  All right. I had it. Fuck. I'm not mad. What was this one like this? Yep. All right. Easy,
[666.10s -> 681.94s]  easy, easy. That's not too, that's not dropping too far. It really isn't. Oh, okay. Slow down.
[686.63s -> 691.43s]  I had the right idea though. That's the right idea. Just not as long.
[691.75s -> 704.95s]  Yeah. Oh, my man, slow down. My man, slow down. All right. I'll slow down. I'll slow down. I had
[704.95s -> 712.65s]  it. What am I doing? Okay. All right. All right. It's not even that bad. I, I really just fucked
[712.65s -> 729.86s]  it up though. Bad. Faster. Don't tell me to go faster. That's not a good idea. Oh man. Okay. I
[729.86s -> 737.50s]  really do have to slow down. All right. That's fine. And then this is the long one. Don't you
[737.50s -> 755.85s]  dare. And then up here. Okay. Then like this. All right. How do I get through here? Reliably.
[755.85s -> 766.22s]  I have to like fall into it. I got it. I got it. What's this? How am I supposed to get up here?
[766.86s -> 802.01s]  Do I have to bounce off the wall? I think I have to bounce off the wall. Just jump. I don't have
[802.01s -> 833.32s]  to go down from, hold on a second. From here? Is there any music in this game? The ledge on the
[833.32s -> 855.16s]  left? Wait, what do you mean the ledge on the left? Wait, what? You mean like over here? What?
[855.16s -> 859.80s]  How am I supposed to get over there? That's not even a ledge. That's a, it's like two pixels.
[867.43s -> 878.02s]  Oh shit. Oh, all right. Good. Good. Just breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.
[878.82s -> 883.46s]  You got to go from far away here. This is, look at how small that area that is. And I don't want
[883.46s -> 902.25s]  to fall. Holy fuck. Okay. Uh, save it? There's no saving. Wrong one. Why is it here though?
[905.51s -> 914.02s]  I can't, I don't, I don't jump, I jump from here, right? If I do a huge jump from here,
[914.02s -> 933.18s]  will I make it to the bottom one? No, I don't think so. I don't like this. I don't like this.
[936.57s -> 940.17s]  Oh, I don't like this. I'm a Nancy Drew streamer guys. I don't like this,
[941.35s -> 946.07s]  but I'm, I kind of addicted to it. I'm not, that's me. That's not upset. I'm not upset.
[946.07s -> 949.83s]  I'm just stating that I don't like this. That's not me being upset about something.
[951.37s -> 955.93s]  Look, I can go to a restaurant and order food, take a bite out of the steak and go,
[955.93s -> 961.45s]  I don't like this steak. I don't think I'm a meat person. I don't like meat. I'm not like,
[961.93s -> 967.61s]  fucking meat shithead. I hate you. Meat sucks. And like stabbing it with my knife. That's,
[967.61s -> 974.46s]  I'm not doing that. I'm just simply saying that I don't like meat. That's not me being upset at
[974.46s -> 977.50s]  the meat. That's been me just telling you, but I don't, I don't like to, I don't want it.
[982.02s -> 999.43s]  Vegan. Stop it. Oh God, no. This ain't even like the first five minutes of the game too.
[1007.22s -> 1017.85s]  All right. That was pretty clean. All right. That's clean. Clean. Clean. Oh no.
[1018.17s -> 1033.85s]  Oh slob. Okay. How do I get over there? Some of you guys right now are sitting there going like,
[1033.85s -> 1050.65s]  oh my, he didn't even know. Just wait till he gets to the broken down helicopter. Oh fuck. Okay.
[1050.65s -> 1054.97s]  I've actually got mad there. I really did. I, that, that was, I'm, I am upset about that part.
[1055.77s -> 1064.52s]  You can put one down. I have to change the stream title. This is going to be,
[1065.48s -> 1072.57s]  this VOD is going to be eight or nine different VODs. And there's going to be a number on each
[1072.57s -> 1076.25s]  one. So you're just going to be able to skip to your favorite chapter of angry, of angriness.
[1077.05s -> 1097.74s]  That's one. I actually, that did piss me off. Scroll down the VOD listed seat. Oh, well it looks
[1097.74s -> 1105.02s]  like angry eight to angry nine was six minutes of two different VODs. Wow. That's interesting.
[1105.74s -> 1115.30s]  He really dialed it up there because from, from one to two, it was an hour.
[1116.02s -> 1142.62s]  I wonder what happened here. I'm down to the beginning. I'm going to go down to the beginning.
[1152.09s -> 1162.87s]  Oh my God, man. I'm the, I'm, I'm even slowing down. I'm even slowing down too.
[1172.54s -> 1180.07s]  I was up there. I had it. I really did. I'm doing it way too long. What the hell am I doing?
[1188.17s -> 1208.66s]  That's not upset. That's me asking a question. I'm just simply asking a question.
[1210.79s -> 1213.91s]  If you think it's hard now, you will not beat this game. I didn't be getting over it.
[1221.42s -> 1226.70s]  I got like 40% of the way through getting over it. And then I think I remember actually saying,
[1227.34s -> 1233.53s]  why am I playing this game? Like, what do you get from this? This is me. I'm not upset about
[1233.53s -> 1236.97s]  anything. I'm just asking a question. What do you get? What do you gain from playing this game?
[1239.93s -> 1255.13s]  The taking up a smoking habit. I don't know. I don't get it. You get gamer points. Well,
[1255.13s -> 1265.50s]  I don't need any more of those. All right. Here we go. I'm going to get out. I'm going to get
[1265.50s -> 1270.46s]  through this tree right now. I already have a gamer license. Yeah. I don't, I don't need a
[1270.46s -> 1275.78s]  different gamer license. I already have one. I already have mine. All right. Slow down.
[1276.34s -> 1317.70s]  How I don't understand how that was wrong. Dude, come on. My webcam is the best part.
[1317.78s -> 1325.10s]  I don't even have my webcast on. He can't jump omega law. Yes, I can. I just need to get,
[1325.10s -> 1338.71s]  I got to get used to the control system. This one is just, this one's fucking me every time.
[1339.35s -> 1356.82s]  It's just fucking me up every time. You got to be so good with that one. He sucks. This game is
[1356.82s -> 1377.88s]  fucking hard, man. Dude, the jump King is hot. What the hell are you talking about? All right.
[1377.88s -> 1383.96s]  What am I doing wrong here? I got it. I got it. All right. Everybody can relax. I got it.
[1413.21s -> 1419.42s]  You know, the worst thing about playing a game like this on stream is if I, if I was just alone
[1419.42s -> 1424.94s]  in my room and no one was watching, that doesn't bother me at all. Fall and death, whatever. That's
[1424.94s -> 1428.94s]  just going to happen. The whole, this whole game was designed for you to fall a thousand times.
[1428.94s -> 1435.26s]  Right. But when you, when you're in front of like a bunch of people, everyone knows you just fell.
[1435.26s -> 1441.90s]  Even though even in my mind, whatever, who cares? This is a giant microscope being pointed down at
[1441.90s -> 1446.14s]  my house. There's a bunch of alien scientists looking through my window right now with a fucking
[1446.14s -> 1465.10s]  microscope. Damn it. It's because you're so small. No, you know what I mean though? It's like,
[1465.10s -> 1469.34s]  if you play a game like this, you're going to, you're going to, it's going to take you
[1469.34s -> 1473.82s]  50 hours to get up here. And it don't matter. You don't have any alien, you don't have aliens
[1473.82s -> 1478.71s]  with telescopes looking through your window and then go and they go, Oh, did you shoot that one?
[1481.02s -> 1519.16s]  It's just you and your Eggo waffles. Fuck. Okay. Fuck. How am I going to get over there? How do I
[1519.16s -> 1524.47s]  get to that one? How do I get to that one? How do I get to that one? How do I get to that one?
[1524.47s -> 1533.80s]  Oh my God. I got it. Um, now what? All the way over to the right. But is it all the way? I'm
[1533.80s -> 1541.46s]  going all the way, going all the way. I made it. I've made it. I did it. See right now, the aliens
[1541.46s -> 1555.86s]  are looking down. They're going like, I can't believe he did it. I'm the laser. There's no
[1555.86s -> 1576.04s]  reason to watch earth entertainment anymore. He beat junking chapter one. Got it. Oh, I got,
[1576.04s -> 1582.94s]  this is a safe spot right here though. That's okay. That's fine. I'm, I'm, I'm glad I cannot
[1582.94s -> 1592.70s]  fall down this unless I really fuck this part up right here. All right. That fucking guy driving
[1592.70s -> 1600.02s]  the car, the guy in the fucking car that just sped by at a thousand miles per hour, it's just
[1600.02s -> 1616.20s]  screamed in my ear. What the fuck, man? Look, that's so annoying. That's so annoying. Whatever.
[1616.20s -> 1620.60s]  That's two. That's I, give me a break though. Seriously. I get to be mad at that.
[1623.42s -> 1627.74s]  I get to be upset about that. That's so annoying. And somebody just screaming outside your window
[1627.74s -> 1633.06s]  as loud as they can. Like somebody just threw a glass bottle at my house while I took that jump.
[1633.86s -> 1641.34s]  I'll get back up there. That was the alien laser.
[1643.66s -> 1649.66s]  We missed. Fuck. Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh.
[1651.94s -> 1654.98s]  Okay. Please get me up there. I just want to get past chapter one.
[1656.70s -> 1670.28s]  Oh no. No, no, no. The guy driving the fucking car, man. He's so easily distractable.
[1671.08s -> 1675.56s]  Oh, I'm so easily distractable. I'm so distractable. I get so upset.
[1675.56s -> 1679.96s]  It's like so easy to like turn me around. All right. I got to relax
[1684.98s -> 1688.26s]  because right now in my head, I can't stop it. I can't stop it.
[1689.22s -> 1693.94s]  There's a voice in my head that continues to say, fuck that guy. What's that guy's problem?
[1694.74s -> 1699.22s]  That guy's a dick. Isn't that guy a dick? Don't you hate that guy? That guy sucks. And I'm just like,
[1699.22s -> 1715.75s]  yeah, that guy sucks. I have to make a jump. Hold on. Hold on, Larry. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[1715.75s -> 1727.94s]  Oh my God. Okay. I'm back. This one actually is, this one's a challenge. Actually, it really is.
[1729.61s -> 1734.02s]  Now if I just get, okay, relax. There's no cars now. There's no speeding.
[1735.86s -> 1757.77s]  All right. Just make it over here. Got it. Done. Got it. Okay. We're good. Colossal drain. I got,
[1757.77s -> 1763.29s]  oh yeah, but this channel points on the channel now. If you want to redeem them, I guess. I
[1763.53s -> 1765.85s]  haven't done anything to them. It's just whatever they have for default. So,
[1772.10s -> 1776.81s]  okay. I definitely can't, that's going to, I can't stand on that. That's a tiny little,
[1777.77s -> 1798.41s]  oh yeah. Really? How am I going to, oh shit. Okay. Do I, is this, is this, is this a jump up
[1798.41s -> 1818.23s]  scenario? It is. I need some trajectory here. All right. Oh, oh, oh, oh, all right. I haven't
[1818.23s -> 1832.68s]  made a mistake, a major mistake in a little bit. Yes, I did. Oh, that's, that sucks. That sucks.
[1832.68s -> 1864.89s]  That sucks. I'm not upset about that, but that sucks. Okay. Stop. Okay. Good. Same deal. Oh no,
[1864.89s -> 1874.70s]  God. Oh no. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. That would have been three. That would have been three. It would
[1874.70s -> 1881.99s]  have been, that's not though. Okay. I'm going to, I don't know how long to hold for that one though.
[1885.53s -> 1905.03s]  If you're not with you, it's the end too. I'm good. How are you? This game's addicting though.
[1905.03s -> 1932.07s]  That's the one problem. Thankfully, this part's very easy. This one though, it's just,
[1932.79s -> 1946.22s]  I can get this one every time, but this one, not every time. Don't you dare. All right. Let's go.
[1950.34s -> 1970.28s]  Ah, got it. Ooh. It feels so good when you get it. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um,
[1973.02s -> 1981.03s]  let me take a minute here. So I have to bounce off the wall. Or do I? Or should I just jump
[1981.03s -> 1986.54s]  straight over? Is the, is the rain going to hit me? Is there obstacles in the game? Is there
[1987.26s -> 2019.53s]  hazards? That's not a three at a time. It's not, it's not that bad. Okay. Now it's bad. Now it is.
[2019.53s -> 2026.52s]  Now it will be. It will be in a minute. It will be here. It's going to be in a, oh my God. Oh my
[2026.52s -> 2032.92s]  God. I'm not mad. I'm not upset about it. Oh my God. I'm just surprised and very, very sad.
[2032.92s -> 2051.83s]  I'm just surprised about what happened. Oh man. I'm just surprised. I went too far. I went way too
[2051.83s -> 2087.30s]  far. Oh, hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in. Uh, hold it in. Uh,
[2087.30s -> 2094.86s]  yes has, is online gave 5,000, gave $50 right now. Good job getting past chapter one.
[2096.87s -> 2105.24s]  Thanks. I'll take the congratulatory $50. Thanks with 5,000 bits. Uh, yes is online. Thank you.
[2106.28s -> 2116.70s]  Are there save points? No. That's not mad. That's laughing.
[2117.42s -> 2140.10s]  Okay. It's all being bottled up. Get off there. Don't make me mad. Okay. He's evolving. No,
[2140.10s -> 2165.05s]  I'm good. Okay. We're good. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[2165.05s -> 2175.91s]  Okay. Crisis averted. Sorry. Sorry. I sat down. I sat down with thumb tech. Sorry about that.
[2176.87s -> 2198.31s]  Why is this? Is this on my chair? This part just sucks. It just, I know. I know. He doesn't know.
[2199.91s -> 2206.39s]  Broken out helicopter. I know. But for my, my current perspective in the current environment,
[2206.39s -> 2224.81s]  I'm in right this second. This part is hard for me. Just jump because if you get this wrong,
[2225.53s -> 2245.26s]  even if it's easy, is this a shovel night guy? I'm just realizing this right now. Somebody just
[2245.34s -> 2261.77s]  used the channel points. What did you do? Don't you dare. That's exactly what I thought when I
[2261.77s -> 2268.57s]  saw this. Somebody said, highlight my message, pee pee poo poo. That's a good use of channel
[2268.57s -> 2283.83s]  points. I don't even know if they do. It's gotta be longer than that, but you get it's scary because
[2283.83s -> 2296.90s]  don't you get, it's gotta be longer than that. I'm just so scared to do a jump there. Uh,
[2296.90s -> 2311.30s]  at the starfish. Thanks for five community subs. Appreciate it. Thank you. Get me over here. Come
[2311.30s -> 2321.48s]  on. All right. Come on. Come on. Now I'm good. I just have to figure out what they want, what,
[2321.48s -> 2326.04s]  what they, what they want me to do here. Adventure MF Dan, five community subs. Thank you, Dan.
[2327.16s -> 2339.88s]  Thanks a lot. Both of you. Is it, is it? Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Now these are going to
[2339.88s -> 2347.29s]  fall, aren't they? These are going to fall. I'm going to jump on them and they're going to fall
[2347.29s -> 2357.38s]  down. No, they're not. Why did that, why did that go longer? Why did that go longer? Why did that
[2357.38s -> 2364.02s]  go longer? It's like, why did it go longer? Why did it go longer? What was that? Is that one
[2364.02s -> 2369.06s]  different, these paste? I'm not mad. I'm asking a question. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
[2369.06s -> 2375.94s]  upset just asking questions. That's just, that's like, that's, I feel like about like a politics
[2375.94s -> 2387.53s]  show. No, no, no, no. I'm not, I'm not upset. I'm just, I'm simply asking a question. Like,
[2387.53s -> 2403.11s]  no, you're very clearly very upset. We have more subs coming. Fitty gave some community subs.
[2403.67s -> 2422.49s]  Just farming channel points and emotes. Ignore, please. Well, thank you, Fitty. Friends are fun
[2422.49s -> 2437.06s]  when you hang out together and you don't get upset about anything. I almost blew that one.
[2437.70s -> 2447.90s]  He's malding. I'm not. You'll know. You'll know. It's been very clear when there's been a two and
[2448.30s -> 2468.15s]  there's been very clear when two and three have happened. So three, that's cheated. Oh, no, no,
[2468.15s -> 2472.23s]  no, there was no three. Yeah. Yeah. You got, you got, you guys are just like, you guys are gas
[2472.23s -> 2484.15s]  lighting. We didn't think that I had a third month, right? Witty username. Thanks to the five
[2484.15s -> 2492.41s]  communities. Oh, I like this game though. It's fun. Even though I, I'm not a big fan of steak,
[2492.97s -> 2503.51s]  but if it's, if it's prepared, well, I'll, you know, I'll lead it. All right. My hands are,
[2503.59s -> 2512.66s]  wow. It's that spot up here that just killing me. Cause I can do this without a problem. Now
[2513.61s -> 2519.37s]  this area is not a big deal to me at all. As I'm very clearly showing, not making a single mistake
[2519.93s -> 2531.21s]  getting up to that point. For instance, like here is fine over here is fine up to this one.
[2531.21s -> 2537.05s]  And then over here. So as you can tell, shit, I'm just, it's just this jump here. That's causing me
[2537.05s -> 2542.58s]  any problems at all. Why did it go to what happened there? What? Hold on. No, I couldn't
[2542.58s -> 2548.78s]  put my hands down. What happened? Did my analog go the other way? Lots of community subs get the,
[2548.78s -> 2557.75s]  the acidic vengeance. Thanks for five community subs. Okay. Seriously. No, no, no, no, no. What,
[2557.75s -> 2564.74s]  what, what happened? What's going on? I don't understand. Okay. It's not, I'm being dead
[2564.74s -> 2572.92s]  serious. Why does, what is going, why is that happening? I'm not crazy. I don't know why that,
[2572.92s -> 2578.07s]  why would I do that? Why would I do that? Why would I get all the way up there and just then do
[2578.07s -> 2586.25s]  that? Use the D pad. That's adding, uh, that's fucking it up for me. I can't use the pad now.
[2586.25s -> 2593.11s]  I'm too used to it. What did I, I don't, I just wish I knew what, what was going on.
[2593.83s -> 2599.03s]  Mark, Marks, Marcus, Marcus, five community subs. That's another five community subs.
[2600.09s -> 2606.82s]  I just asked, I'm just asking a question. Don't you guys know that as long as you tell people,
[2606.82s -> 2611.78s]  you're not mad, you're not bad. It doesn't matter because you know who you, you know,
[2611.78s -> 2619.34s]  you know yourself. And even if your face is turning bright red, I'm not, I'm not upset about
[2619.34s -> 2629.75s]  this. You're only mad when you actually tell people you are. All right. Now what the fuck
[2629.75s -> 2638.39s]  is going on over here? All right. I got to use the D pad. It's, it's getting in my head now.
[2639.75s -> 2646.79s]  It's good. The D pad things get in my head too long. I know, but then it was too short.
[2646.79s -> 2652.39s]  It was too long. Then it was too long. It was too long. Then it was too short. Then it was too long.
[2652.39s -> 2659.03s]  It was too short. Then it was too long. If you're going to do the impression, you have to raise
[2659.03s -> 2673.26s]  your voice in a couple of octaves. Nope. I can't do the D pad. Shit. I can't devolve right now.
[2674.06s -> 2681.78s]  No, no, no. Okay. I can't, I can't just evolve. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You know, it's,
[2681.78s -> 2687.34s]  it's happening and I haven't even been playing for like an hour. Um, the controls don't work.
[2687.34s -> 2692.15s]  I'm playing a dream and I'm going to dream right now. I'm pressing the buttons in the wrong order
[2692.15s -> 2696.33s]  and shit. Yup. You guys know what I'm talking about. You know, when you get like to a point
[2696.33s -> 2699.77s]  where you're devolving and pressing buttons in the wrong order, I'm pressing buttons in the wrong
[2699.77s -> 2705.26s]  fucking order and I'm, it's over. Somebody came over and shook me and I'm not even, I'm not even,
[2705.26s -> 2711.26s]  I'm not even actually like upset about anything. I'm just devolved. God damn it. I was fucking
[2711.26s -> 2716.62s]  devolved. Oh, all right. Add it. That's three. No, that, that counts. It does. No, fuck that.
[2716.62s -> 2724.95s]  That's I'm, I'm count it. That's fine. I actually am annoyed by the fact that, but I'm not, is it
[2724.95s -> 2731.64s]  count? I'm not mad at game. Okay. I don't think I did. I, I, I, somebody came over and hit me
[2731.64s -> 2736.84s]  in the head with a wrench. I can't, like the buttons, the controls of a foreign to me now,
[2737.80s -> 2755.18s]  like left, right. And then a, or like a, and then right. I, it's foreign to me. God, I know it's
[2755.18s -> 2770.47s]  just three buttons, but when they, they, they bleed together. Relax. Cause like in my brain,
[2770.47s -> 2775.99s]  it's like left and a, or a then left, or a then right. No, a then right. A left and a.
[2777.16s -> 2781.72s]  I'm doing moving and then jumping instead of jumping and then moving the analog. And I'm just
[2781.72s -> 2790.62s]  doing it backwards. I'm fine. Next up we have, oh, hold on. Let's like, I can't do this joke
[2790.62s -> 2827.18s]  unless I have a face cam. So I can't do this yet. Maybe later. Cause I'm too focused. Why can't I
[2827.18s -> 2841.80s]  do this one now? I was doing it. Okay. Stop it. Okay. I need to, no, don't. Whoa. Look at how
[2841.80s -> 2854.38s]  many fails. 62 fails. Where's my cam? Is it even plugged in? No. Hold on.
[2864.17s -> 2887.93s]  All right. Let me, let me get this ready.
[2904.95s -> 2930.81s]  This is my break time. This is a show. What are you talking about?
[2936.86s -> 2942.62s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to around politics where we talk about politics.
[2942.62s -> 2948.14s]  We go over all the things in politics. Joining me now via satellite who claims he's absolutely
[2948.14s -> 2952.79s]  not angry at all. Fire satellite from Las Vegas, Nevada. We're going to get the state of his
[2952.79s -> 2972.41s]  political party. German nine eight five. Are you with us? Yeah. Yeah, mom. What are the questions?
[2972.41s -> 2997.26s]  Just, uh, just have a few of those myself. Why is your face so red? We don't know. I didn't tell you.
[2997.26s -> 3000.38s]  I was angry. I just kept, I was just coming on the show to answer a few questions to give you
[3000.38s -> 3036.62s]  some of my own. He's so livid. Mega milk. What's that? Stop. Stop. Oh yeah. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3036.62s -> 3039.66s]  ladies and gentlemen, hold on a minute here. I'm getting, I'm getting word.
[3044.90s -> 3053.58s]  Oh, what's that? Uh, this just did. Ladies and gentlemen, if, if you are wearing a white shirt
[3053.58s -> 3060.84s]  with blue sleeves on it, just getting the word right now, then you have to absolutely be
[3060.84s -> 3064.84s]  referencing. What am I getting on my desk here? You absolutely have to be referencing some fucking
[3064.84s -> 3120.33s]  weird anime shit apparently. Yes. Anytime you wear a blue sleeved t-shirt. What? I don't know. All
[3120.33s -> 3133.21s]  right. Let me at least get through chapter two. We're just having fun today. Where am I? Where am
[3133.21s -> 3136.57s]  I? Where am I? Where's my character? What happened? How did I get over here? Is this a secret?
[3137.05s -> 3154.63s]  Where? What happened? Yes. What do I do about this? Can I get anywhere from here? I think I have to
[3154.63s -> 3170.87s]  go back up. Go down. Oh, what? I didn't know there were illusory walls in the game. What?
[3171.99s -> 3178.14s]  Okay. Now that I know that, that doesn't really help me though. This just kind of makes it,
[3178.14s -> 3195.27s]  this makes it harder. Why would I do that? That makes it harder. I just like burped and acid went
[3195.27s -> 3206.46s]  up into my throat. Is that me being mad? That's my body being mad, right? Or I think that's my
[3206.46s -> 3213.88s]  hernia. I think that's just a symptom of a hiatal hernia. Yeah, I think so. Okay. So no, then no,
[3213.88s -> 3227.51s]  that doesn't matter. Five? All right. I was up there so much. I just got to get back to what I
[3227.51s -> 3237.02s]  was doing. Just back to where I was. Holy shit. I almost just blew that. No, no, no, don't go
[3237.02s -> 3246.97s]  straight down. Oh, man. I had it too. I'm sitting at the roulette table and I put a thousand dollars
[3247.61s -> 3256.39s]  on like red 21 and it landed in the space next to it. So I was like, that's like, that's,
[3256.39s -> 3261.27s]  that's $35,000. I had it. I mean, it was right there. I thought, you know, it'll happen again.
[3261.27s -> 3285.86s]  If I do it again, slow it down. Take a minute. That's Vegas humor. Stop. Why did I even read
[3285.86s -> 3289.38s]  chat? What was the point of reading chat? Why did I look over? Why would I look over there?
[3289.38s -> 3292.98s]  What would I look over at chat for, for that reason? At that moment? Why would I do that?
[3293.88s -> 3298.92s]  There's no, there's no reason for me to look over the chat room when I'm in the middle of holding
[3298.92s -> 3309.59s]  down a jump. Like I'm just asking to lose. There's no reason to do what I just did.
[3314.63s -> 3344.47s]  I'm not mad about this. I'm just stating a fact. Okay. Mad.
[3344.71s -> 3368.18s]  Hmm. Quiet. Quiet. Good. Good. Good. Now get over it. All right. Took me long enough. No,
[3368.18s -> 3372.18s]  just not that. It's something about, there's a bug in the game. There's a bug in the game.
[3372.18s -> 3374.10s]  There has to be a bug in the game. There's a bug in the game. There's a bug in the game.
[3374.10s -> 3376.26s]  There's a bug in the game. There's a bug in the game. That spot right there. There's a bug in
[3376.26s -> 3379.30s]  the game. That's the third time that's happened. It's the only time it's happened the entire time
[3379.30s -> 3384.34s]  I played the entire game for an hour. That's the only time that's happened. It's only in that spot.
[3384.34s -> 3387.30s]  Why is it only in that spot? Makes no sense. That's the only time that's happened.
[3389.27s -> 3391.99s]  Like I'm trying to get that to happen right now. And it won't.
[3392.95s -> 3400.02s]  You understand? Why? Why is that the only spot where that happens?
[3400.02s -> 3434.57s]  There's a bug in the game. Five. Maybe. I'll put it to the judges. We'll see. Get out of here.
[3434.57s -> 3436.01s]  Is this a British bake-off?
[3436.89s -> 3444.94s]  I just need to determine if he was actually angry or not.
[3456.50s -> 3470.65s]  Now what? What's up here? I did it. I made like this shop. Okay, there's a shop right here.
[3470.65s -> 3496.12s]  Now what? I did it. I'm so scared to do this. Oh, look at this next part. Look at this next part.
[3506.42s -> 3512.63s]  Foss King's Keep. This doesn't look that bad. You're right. It really doesn't. As long as I
[3512.63s -> 3539.34s]  slow down. I mean, that's I think that's what I have to do. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[3539.34s -> 3542.06s]  It's not that bad. It's not. Get the bird. Get the bird. No, I don't care about the bird.
[3542.79s -> 3547.72s]  Why would I get the bird for? I'm not getting the bird. You want to go get the bird.
[3548.28s -> 3562.65s]  Why would I do that? Just to get the good ending. All right. The judges have determined that I was
[3562.65s -> 3576.46s]  actually upset. Oops. I didn't mean. Okay. I meant to change it to 20.
[3577.26s -> 3587.38s]  I'm sorry. I meant to change it to 20. Yeah, I guess I leveled up. I guess I got more. I leveled up.
[3589.00s -> 3612.20s]  Every time I go another floor. I get another 10. I leveled up. No, stop. Okay, just just do what I
[3612.20s -> 3628.26s]  was doing. Every time you fall down, you lose. No, that's not how it works. You don't get to take
[3628.26s -> 3638.76s]  you don't take levels away. You just gain levels. You don't d level in any video games. In what
[3638.76s -> 3648.04s]  video game do you d level for doing poorly? No, you just get stronger. How's that wrong? You d
[3648.04s -> 3673.42s]  level. Okay. Don't be stupid. These little jumps make me want to go to the dentist and have them
[3673.42s -> 3692.57s]  just drill without novocaine. Am I mad? No, no. Okay. No, you're just a psycho. Yeah. Okay. That
[3692.57s -> 3752.68s]  doesn't mean I'm mad. How am I going to get up here? I have. Wait, what? I see. I know. I know
[3752.68s -> 3759.69s]  all you guys are secretly rooting against me. That's the thing. You know what I mean? I know it.
[3759.69s -> 3764.73s]  I know. It's like I'm the bad guy. I'm the I'm the guy that comes out during the wrestling event
[3764.73s -> 3772.57s]  that knows he's going to get booed when he comes out. I'm the heel of the stream. You want to see
[3772.57s -> 3797.06s]  me fall. You want to see me fall down. So these little jumps that make me giggle. Okay, stop.
[3797.06s -> 3804.81s]  Stop. Stop. I will actually fuck this all up. That's not mad. You guys have been around this
[3804.81s -> 3813.32s]  channel for long enough to know what that actually means. Right? You guys are just waiting for someone
[3813.32s -> 3817.98s]  to open the door and hit me in the back of the head with a fucking chair. You know how many
[3817.98s -> 3821.90s]  pog champs would happen if somebody just give guy in a speedo came in the back door here
[3822.46s -> 3867.08s]  and just smashed me in the back of the head with a fucking folding chair. I oh my don't do it.
[3867.64s -> 3887.99s]  I'm gonna try uh see if I can get to the next level.
[3890.86s -> 3914.95s]  I fell. Why is the audio so bad? When was this video uploaded? Or this video was
[3914.95s -> 3918.31s]  uploaded like two years ago. Why does it sound like a cell phone video?
[3930.26s -> 3938.31s]  There are a lot. Like can I just say there are at least like three or four very large viewed
[3938.31s -> 3957.91s]  WWE best chair shots. This is happening to me.
[3981.82s -> 3994.87s]  I was reacting. Oh dude. Oh what the oh holy shit those are brutal. That wasn't
[3994.87s -> 4007.03s]  bad. I was reacting to the video. You know you do something enough times that you probably have to
[4007.03s -> 4013.59s]  figure out that it's not what you're supposed to do. I think I've hit that moment right now.
[4022.22s -> 4031.96s]  No you don't go that way. Is it mad if I tell that person to shut up
[4032.76s -> 4044.02s]  for spamming another streamer's stream in here? No that would just be me. That's not mad.

[4153.74s -> 4185.18s]  moment where I play you say run. You guys know what I'm talking about. I also would rather fall
[4185.18s -> 4187.98s]  down the whole thing and have to go up because I'm just seeing this on repeat and it's killing me.
[4188.70s -> 4215.91s]  God get. All right one two three go. No no no no no no that one is too hard.

[4239.06s -> 4256.97s]  like about it now it's stupid now I don't like it with 0.2 hours in game. I'm gonna have a

[13193.67s -> 13198.55s]  only reason why it exists and i know it's gonna be some like oh you really wanted that coin well
[13198.55s -> 13203.35s]  chasing the coin is it was the detriment the whole time you didn't even need the coin you don't even
[13203.35s -> 13209.43s]  need those boots the coin it was the fucking variable that you don't need the boots to win

[14413.48s -> 14447.10s]  hey that didn't make it up it consumed them oh god zoom in on that one because that's the worst
[14447.10s -> 14453.42s]  jump in the whole game so far absolutely without a doubt that is the worst jump in the entire
[14453.42s -> 14473.10s]  fucking game without a thousand doubts like without a single doubt in my mind i don't even have to i
[14473.10s -> 14477.74s]  think about that for a second hey what was like the dumbest jump in the whole game oh uh probably
[14477.74s -> 14481.90s]  the one where you have to basketball yourself down a hole and it has to be exact or you fall
[14481.90s -> 14512.22s]  down the whole thing he doesn't know about the broken down helicopter like the margin for human
[14512.22s -> 14517.18s]  error we just don't give a shit about any of that what do robots have to play these games
[14518.97s -> 14559.70s]  fucking jump king somebody else is doing it for me no they're not oh my god how did i keep that
[14559.70s -> 14567.30s]  enough down here because they have these they have like three jumps that are so fucking finicky that
[14567.30s -> 14574.18s]  if you like why are these not like that why is this jump right here not why is this jump right
[14574.18s -> 14592.25s]  here not like that i don't understand it's fucking ridiculous and it sucks because i know it's
[14592.25s -> 14599.40s]  intentional like there's a person right now standing in front of me and i'm not i'm not
[14599.40s -> 14606.54s]  supposed to get mad at this person right but this person is going in my face la la la la la la la la

[14623.82s -> 14628.30s]  hey like right in my face it's like dude get the fuck out of here no it's intentional therefore
[14630.92s -> 14684.02s]  see i got you i wouldn't say sorry i got you did he make it yet no not even close it's just so
[14684.98s -> 14688.90s]  uh like humans humans are so imperfect you know what i mean
[14690.50s -> 14698.70s]  this game goes against everything we know as humans humans are imperfect we can't do perfect
[14698.70s -> 14721.02s]  fucking things we're not capable of that you can't the speedrun is five minutes and that person
[14721.02s -> 14740.02s]  probably spent hundreds and hundreds of hours playing this those are some red ass eyes it was
[14740.02s -> 14780.90s]  five minutes don't make me laugh i'm trying to get out of here by the way this guy wouldn't
[14780.90s -> 14821.70s]  last in the fucking mcu i got news for you he would do this and then get liquidated that was
[14821.70s -> 14827.32s]  just so long ago all right can we agree that if i'm not gonna i'm not gonna get the coin
[14827.32s -> 14855.14s]  i don't care no coin i don't this is a coinless run what was wrong with that what was wrong with
[14855.14s -> 14874.17s]  that who just gave money lots of money uh pigums gave ten thousand bits thank you pigums
[14874.73s -> 14879.13s]  for the huge amount of money and there was also community subs too from uh flies and flinzenberg

[15489.85s -> 15497.61s]  with you it's built meticulously this mad scientist game developer sat at every corner
[15498.17s -> 15506.58s]  every single little corner and was like they had cauldrons bubbling behind him it was
[15506.58s -> 15526.89s]  meticulously crafted to fuck with you grunt hilda yeah this is the this is the this game dead is the
[15526.89s -> 15542.30s]  grunt hilda of game development i've devised this is such a fun game
[15570.50s -> 15596.31s]  no no a stupid basketball jump let's just take another guess try to remember the exact well it's
[15596.31s -> 15602.73s]  not the position it's just the time holding the button because no matter what you'll you're never
[15602.73s -> 15606.81s]  gonna do it the same length every time you're all you'll always miss it by like a quarter of a
[15606.81s -> 15610.41s]  second like a tenth of a second it's just like all right no that was a little bit too high but
[15610.41s -> 15614.97s]  i still made it this one you know i'm gonna stand right on the edge and go one two no it's way too
[15614.97s -> 15644.12s]  hard way too long way too long i'll just guess how do we go no no no we're not no we're not down
[15644.12s -> 15656.97s]  we go we're good fuck off with this i'm done with this let's get out and get me to progression where

[16049.54s -> 16063.66s]  all my memory on my muscle memory i can't go over that i can't do that now i just got to get back
[16063.66s -> 16079.26s]  up to where i was before it's all it's all this dumb bird coin that's i got a prediction in like
[16079.26s -> 16085.02s]  the alternate metaverse i don't collect that stupid coin on the right i'm probably it was still there
[16085.02s -> 16097.06s]  progressing fuck that coin you ain't ever gonna see me get that coin again unless i get it on
[16097.06s -> 16170.55s]  unless i get it on accident it's the worst jump of the whole game it's the worst like look at
[16170.55s -> 16175.19s]  just look at how fast i'm just going through all this shit and then i hit that dumb ass jump
[16176.63s -> 16193.08s]  and it all falls to shit no he's still here omega low yeah
[16196.28s -> 16201.83s]  all right quiet i keep overshooting it yeah when i try to undershoot it when i not when i try to
[16201.83s -> 16206.39s]  not overshoot it i undershoot it and sometimes i even go in the fucking thing and then it spits
[16206.39s -> 16285.64s]  me out do the dlc why would i do the dlc when i haven't done the original game some of these
[16285.64s -> 16299.69s]  should be landing like come on what the fuck and then immediately after is that stupid ass fucking
[16299.69s -> 16310.22s]  jump oh my god guys like right after it is that other like tiny little perfect baby jump give me
[16310.54s -> 16332.30s]  break i can't get out of this zone i'm stuck here forever i'm stuck here forever i think i

[16417.18s -> 16429.29s]  right uh no no god damn it stop it has nothing to do with tilting it has to do with that jump is
[16429.29s -> 16438.63s]  so fucking precise it's the only one in this whole zone that's like that and even if you
[16438.63s -> 16454.58s]  think you got it you don't oh you don't don't worry you don't my sanity meter is low don't
[16454.58s -> 16465.05s]  read chat nothing to chat it has to do with i'm a mean game designer and want players to suffer
[16466.66s -> 16547.46s]  that's what it is that's that's the deal that's the goal fucking analog sucks i don't think i can hit
[16547.46s -> 16561.21s]  it from here i'm just i'm gonna i'm gonna just launch over yep you just can't from there maybe

[16605.99s -> 16635.19s]  why did that happen it's not about destination it's about the journey now it's about the
[16635.19s -> 16643.88s]  destination at this point it's about the destination i want to get there it's about getting there it's
[16643.88s -> 16651.16s]  about getting to the top that's that's what it is that's about oh really so i'm driving we're

[16801.29s -> 16819.43s]  fucking ever again we're ubering next time the same fucking time and like the two times out of
[16819.43s -> 16830.95s]  like 60 it doesn't work apparently with the same exact approach no don't even do this
[16831.59s -> 16857.19s]  i'm doing it in the wrong direction no i'm not no are you kidding me they make these little jumps
[16857.19s -> 16866.71s]  such a pain in the ass like what a pain in the ass what a pain in the ass it's because of the
[16866.71s -> 16874.15s]  fucking coin again i'm gonna break this disc in half and i don't even own one i'm gonna go buy
[16874.15s -> 16885.82s]  the disc version of this game and then break it back to the tutorial hi guys welcome all because
[16885.90s -> 16899.48s]  i picked up the fucking coin oh all right time to time to and we got to do all these pains in the
[16899.48s -> 16907.80s]  ass jumps again when i bet you anything that all we would need to do is just simply go up like one
[16908.44s -> 16916.10s]  screen at the wind level and we never ain't ever got to see this shit ever again i would guarantee
[16916.10s -> 16924.54s]  it boots boots what are you talking about boots i can't buy the boots what do you mean use the coin

[16966.41s -> 16972.68s]  chance to get back up there at least there was progress there was at least a little bit i did
[16972.68s -> 17009.96s]  get i picked up the coin i did make the bird move can you imagine if i missed dude that jump
[17009.96s -> 17019.08s]  sucks such ass it sucks to do that jump it sucks it's got to be this little perfect fucking jump
[17019.08s -> 17052.25s]  man and if you don't get it you are fucked i'm trying no challenge joel to beat this no no i i'd
[17052.25s -> 17057.69s]  like to see joel live a nice healthy life and not delete like three years of his life because he had

[17817.72s -> 17854.44s]  actually no it shouldn't be okay same deal get me up there let's go baby this is the one chat's
[17854.44s -> 17863.66s]  gonna be delayed on the vod yeah i know that sucks i almost wish with that feature i wish
[17863.66s -> 17868.62s]  that that feature didn't have maybe maybe if it like paused the chat for like a few minutes or
[17868.62s -> 17879.51s]  something because it throws up the whole thing doesn't it ripvod watches yeah sorry guys sorry
[17890.42s -> 17897.35s]  fall down if it's live well you think i'm pumping in like pre-recorded footage
[17898.23s -> 17901.83s]  it's too far and it's too short then it's too far then it's too short then it's too far then it's
[17901.83s -> 17905.03s]  too short then it's too far then it's too short then it's too far then it's too short then it's
[17905.03s -> 17921.99s]  too far then it's too short then it's too short then it's too far then it's too short then it's
[17921.99s -> 17926.94s]  too short then it's too far then it's too far then it's too short then it's too far then it's too
[17926.94s -> 17932.49s]  short it doesn't matter what you do like you'll you'll fuck it up every time did you hold the
[17932.49s -> 17936.81s]  button down for like a tenth of a second earlier you missed did you hold it for a tenth of a second
[17936.81s -> 17952.42s]  longer you don't you butt jumped into the wall idiot i want a super cut of every fall now that
[17952.42s -> 17976.33s]  actually would be kind of interesting considering there's been a 581 of them just skipped through
[17976.33s -> 17996.55s]  the vod this is the super cut oh yeah yeah i really i think this part is way harder
[17997.27s -> 18002.41s]  than the next part the part with the platforms like i wish i could just fall down to that spot
[18002.41s -> 18012.41s]  and not have to do this jump like that like why why why is why why like why
[18013.90s -> 18039.48s]  i would rather do the top the screen above that a thousand more times all right ladies and
[18039.48s -> 18053.78s]  gentlemen let's go end of the stream what no no no no no no no not even close
[18057.38s -> 18060.10s]  if he didn't make that jump he would have turned off the stream
[18066.79s -> 18120.71s]  no don't laugh at what that person just said it was i almost just fucking started laughing

[20178.49s -> 20186.95s]  i finished it i think this is a lot different than simpsons hit and run though
[20187.67s -> 20195.43s]  because i don't have to go back and do the first mission of simpsons hit and run i don't have to
[20195.43s -> 20223.00s]  go back uh to chapter one in simpsons hit and run it might be a little different i just want
[20223.00s -> 20228.12s]  to get back up to the wind i just want to see new content i just have to get up there i just have to

[22005.77s -> 22010.60s]  uh in this whole game based on cynicism and torturing yourself that's the whole point of the

[22063.38s -> 22077.98s]  means i'm really trying are you having fun uh kind of i was and then that fun like translated into

[22322.57s -> 22333.30s]  the way through this game gamer license gone no this is not a game this is a non-canon gamer
[22333.30s -> 22341.35s]  license game not even close this is this is this is like the extended universe for like getting
[22341.35s -> 22348.30s]  extra stamps on your gamer license not even getting one i'm halfway through the game what
[22349.96s -> 22382.39s]  no i'm not you are what are we talking about i'm halfway to my gamer license what are you

[22398.33s -> 22403.13s]  i could we be that close though i mean what would we do if we were that close
[22403.13s -> 22406.81s]  we would probably maybe get a couple of little bit again maybe we get some tunes on
[22440.22s -> 22446.06s]  guys this game is this game's way too hard for me it just is and i've been trying to fight with
[22446.06s -> 22452.14s]  saying like hey is this game like nearly impossible for me to complete oh no no only four percent of
[22452.14s -> 22458.62s]  all humans now i'm one of those four percent of all human beings yeah that's me that's me i'll be
[22458.62s -> 22470.18s]  up there with the trophy no i mean my gamer skill at this point is literally like being able to read

[22904.57s -> 22916.15s]  this game literally ever again but tonight i'm still here because it's all bullshit i'm just
[22916.15s -> 22927.77s]  trying to make myself have to focus you know what i'm saying i'm like i'm like bargaining with my
[22927.77s -> 22935.67s]  own body my own brain that's that's where you yeah if you fall there uh yeah yeah if you fall there
[22935.99s -> 22941.99s]  you said you fucked the whole thing up remember if you do one mistake on one jump is specifically
[22941.99s -> 22956.06s]  some of the it ruins the entire thing you know can't wait for it in 10 years competitive e-sport
[22956.06s -> 22967.26s]  teeth pulling yeah it's gonna be great or who can hit themselves in the face with a chair harder

[23000.22s -> 23005.34s]  yeah i'm gonna have to call it here soon i'm getting to the point where i don't want to see
[23005.34s -> 23011.10s]  these images again you know what i mean it's getting close it's not cool it's not there yet
[23011.10s -> 23016.38s]  but it'll be there probably soon i don't want to see the fucking birds in the background here
[23016.38s -> 23024.74s]  anymore like i don't want to see this anymore you know what i mean it's like i'm replaying the same
[23024.74s -> 23030.66s]  level over and over again it's like i i played level two i don't want to see what two no more
[23031.38s -> 23043.56s]  if you start winning you want that's not true because even if you do start winning that's the
[23043.56s -> 23049.72s]  beauty of this game even if you do win eventually you're going to miss a jump and come back to level
[23049.72s -> 23069.40s]  two you will see level two again my friend oh yes you will many times he thinks he thinks he's not
[23069.40s -> 23106.57s]  gonna see level two again you're getting better i i don't think so i think i've devolved am i
[23106.57s -> 23114.34s]  getting better do you think you actually think so am i getting better i think and am i 50% of the
[23114.34s -> 23120.63s]  way through the game what's the point of leaving that no no no no no no no no no no why i did the
[23120.63s -> 23124.71s]  same thing i did last time i did the same thing i did last time i just wish it didn't go that far
[23124.71s -> 23129.67s]  down like i did i did the same damn thing i did last time just overshot it and now we go all the
[23129.67s -> 23139.14s]  way back down and now we go all the way back down again hey back to back to level one that's that's
[23139.14s -> 23148.20s]  it goodbye that's it goodbye i have to leave i don't want to do this again this is dumb i don't
[23148.20s -> 23158.66s]  want to do this again somebody came in and said dude this game is literal insanity now i see what
[23158.66s -> 23173.26s]  you mean by that your concentration gets maxed out yeah you get to you just everything just starts to
[23173.26s -> 23177.50s]  blend together you don't want to see the crows anymore you don't want to see the green sewer
[23177.50s -> 23182.86s]  anymore and you yeah everything just maxes out there's a finite amount of human brain energy
[23183.82s -> 23192.25s]  oh man i why do i want to beat this what is doing this to me i don't want i don't care what i what
[23192.25s -> 23212.46s]  do i care i don't even care let it go jerry let it go i can't i can't let it go well it's only
[23212.46s -> 23224.39s]  been six and a half hours it's not that long oh my fucking god like just oh it oh that's just
[23224.47s -> 23228.47s]  i'm gonna be i'm gonna be in bed tonight just i'm gonna be fucking furious because i'm just
[23228.47s -> 23236.44s]  gonna be like god damn it i don't i could have gone farther i could have gone further you know
[23236.44s -> 23253.45s]  what i mean i could have done it and i'm gonna have nightmares we may have reached the maximum
[23253.45s -> 23258.60s]  brain capacity though on the second or third thunderstruck that i think we were at the end
[23259.56s -> 23267.16s]  yeah like that that thunderstruck replay number two is when i i maxed out every ounce of my
[23267.16s -> 23279.86s]  concentration so we did play what like three or four more times you know i bet you don't say
[23279.86s -> 23289.29s]  it jeremy don't don't do it don't do it don't say it don't say it don't say it yeah i'm gonna say

[23298.65s -> 23313.30s]  don't say i'm not gonna say it don't say it don't do it if i slept on it if i if i
[23315.64s -> 23320.68s]  yeah if i slept on it i was 50 if i was 50 of the way through the game
[23321.80s -> 23325.08s]  if i sleep on it i come back with and i'm gonna eat a bunch of fucking cereal and shit
[23329.80s -> 23335.00s]  i'm gonna eat like i'm gonna i'm gonna take like a riboflavin extract i'm gonna take it like a b

[23348.63s -> 23365.16s]  and i'm gonna do it i will beat it i just i need i just need energy i need just like brain energy
[23365.16s -> 23370.60s]  you know what i mean because look at i as much as it's hard i know i know this shit and if i came
[23370.60s -> 23375.56s]  back if i listen to thunderstruck on repeat with just earbuds into my as far as i can shove them
[23375.56s -> 23390.90s]  into my ears on max volume on repeat for the next 12 hours in bed i think i could do it let me just
[23390.90s -> 23398.04s]  get up here but i have a question if you save and exit does it start to go where you are
[23400.57s -> 23403.61s]  like will it remember where i am or is it do i have to start from the beginning

[24586.79s -> 24591.19s]  fuck it's it's not a full jump it's not a full jump it's a little bit it's a little less than
[24591.19s -> 24608.52s]  a full jump it's not a full jump damn it creatures thanks for the five community subs creatures rule

[24651.46s -> 24667.77s]  oh now what straight up in the air i don't know jumped to the left or jump up i wonder if i can
[24667.77s -> 24678.84s]  make it

[24881.74s -> 24894.94s]  right without when the wind stops go upright i'm going for it it was the one it was the one it was

[25324.58s -> 25350.50s]  something else i'll tell you this game is something else oh this game is something else

[25555.70s -> 25562.49s]  let me exit the game though
[25567.85s -> 25577.53s]  that's so many falls oh my god i feel like i get hit by like a train
[25578.49s -> 25593.61s]  what's the achievements um i don't even i don't even know what they are the last few stages are
[25593.61s -> 25614.28s]  incredibly difficult no that's that's i'm as it was that was fun but i'm dead that's you're in
[25614.28s -> 25630.86s]  world one i can't believe you kept going well sometimes you just have to go you know what i
[25630.86s -> 25642.15s]  mean he quit streaming six times don't feel pressured to play it tomorrow you can always
[25642.15s -> 25646.47s]  take a break and return another time i know i know but 95 of the stuff i was saying was
[25646.47s -> 25657.69s]  bullshit anyways you know that all right let's go back uh to let me make sure here
[25661.35s -> 25669.43s]  we are going to do the the the couple hours that we played that minecraft event i do want to go
[25669.43s -> 25682.68s]  over some of them at least the ones that i didn't get to catch so these are from the minecraft
[25682.68s -> 25696.01s]  stream uh so from yesterday we had 500 bits from trident jacks thank you trident jacks said what the
[25696.01s -> 25702.60s]  fuck germa sad vega 250 yesterday i greatly enjoyed this you kind of went a little mad
[25702.60s -> 25707.56s]  with power here though yeah that if you if you didn't uh catch the beginning of the stream
[25708.52s -> 25715.16s]  that what we did yesterday was a glorified stress test beta test none of the systems were in place
[25715.16s -> 25723.48s]  the twitch integration wasn't in place the server had some issues and um there was no permadeath
[25725.08s -> 25731.61s]  we just were like you know what let's just go and just have collect data because even
[25731.61s -> 25735.53s]  if you do a stress test when potentially thousands of people are trying to do the
[25735.53s -> 25739.53s]  same thing at the same time uh there's a lot of things that you need to collect
[25740.09s -> 25747.83s]  in regards to how that's even going to work the next time we do that it's going to be put in
[25747.83s -> 25757.00s]  the oven for a little longer so it will be more of the game that we were going to play
[25757.64s -> 25764.28s]  rather than the streams an hour late let's just dump on a bunch of people with no whitelisting
[25767.05s -> 25771.37s]  and like in the future the guards aren't going to be that powerful they're not going to be able
[25771.37s -> 25782.12s]  to teleport that it was really just to keep the peace for a stress test essentially they collected
[25782.12s -> 25796.60s]  our data no no no i'm saying like for the server to be hit that hard keep the peace right so thanks
[25796.60s -> 25801.00s]  for helping us do that because the next time we do it it'll be a lot more fleshed out
[25801.72s -> 25812.39s]  uh thank you nat for the 500 bits creatures rule gave five community subs yesterday as well
[25814.07s -> 25819.59s]  siku gave ten dollars yesterday ten thousand bits they said it's 4 a.m i've been up for a good 24
[25819.59s -> 25830.66s]  hours good morning apparently i get to catch the stream start for once damn yeah none of the guards
[25830.66s -> 25837.58s]  were in creative mode they could just move around and when the game is actually played
[25838.14s -> 25842.78s]  and there's actual permadeath involved and this actual stamina system is actually working
[25842.78s -> 25851.29s]  correctly and everything there will be things in place to make it so it's not just messy the
[25851.29s -> 25859.02s]  first like hour that you play the game yeah the the devs were in creative not the guards right
[25859.02s -> 25868.36s]  yeah is my minecraft mod going to be more or less disappointing than star citizen
[25869.16s -> 25874.76s]  well i'll give you a couple of quick strong differences here uh my minecraft mod events
[25875.24s -> 25881.94s]  uh did not cost 150 million dollars and i didn't start making them 10 years ago
[25883.21s -> 25897.21s]  so there's that oh sorry 280 million dollars right but thank you siku dark soul thanks to
[25897.21s -> 25901.85s]  the 250 bits here's some bits someone apparently stole my minecraft account i haven't used in eight
[25901.85s -> 25916.86s]  years four days ago what can we play cube world instead cube world that's not cool siku again
[25916.86s -> 25921.10s]  thanks to the 500 bits buy a five dollar mic for an upgrade that will be fixed next time as well
[25921.10s -> 25924.94s]  we were trying a different streaming setup so we could show different perspectives of cameras
[25925.50s -> 25929.90s]  but there's probably just going to be two streams next time and i'm just going to squad
[25929.90s -> 25936.30s]  with the other streaming account that's filming stuff so there'll be a squad stream of all the
[25936.30s -> 25943.75s]  stuff going on but it'll be on a separate stream so then you can get like my actual full perspective
[25944.71s -> 25949.88s]  if you don't ever want to see anything else i'm guessing you were talking through discord yeah
[25949.88s -> 25955.66s]  we've been to that i had like a line into my ear where they could tell me things that were you
[25955.66s -> 25964.22s]  know problems that were happening or whatever will that work for a vod um you would just have
[25964.22s -> 25968.70s]  to go to both channels and just queue them up at the same time and just play them at the same time
[25970.95s -> 25974.79s]  because that seems like the best way to make it so i can actually just show my perspective
[25975.43s -> 25987.94s]  always turn off channel points they're garbage this is not the jeremy i love
[25989.53s -> 25996.97s]  um i i didn't even know they were on until they turned on into beta uh like six hours ago
[25998.17s -> 26005.50s]  i don't i didn't even know i had them i didn't even know i had them i'm just going to change
[26005.50s -> 26014.10s]  them to be something it's going to be like 50 000 points to get me to do something i don't know
[26014.66s -> 26022.07s]  i'm gonna up the value i'm gonna up the values and add like three things like you know oh you
[26022.07s -> 26027.03s]  can use like the emote i think that's interesting use emotes for a while you can unlock an emote
[26027.03s -> 26034.39s]  also um for a hundred thousand for for 500 million channel points uh like the old pepsi
[26034.39s -> 26048.54s]  commercials you get a jet remember that for for for 500 million germa channel points
[26049.26s -> 26053.34s]  and then the thing flies down and lands and it's like you could be an owner of a jet
[26058.76s -> 26062.76s]  didn't and somebody here's the funny thing somebody actually that was like a joke
[26062.76s -> 26068.84s]  that pepsi did and i think it was so out of reach that no one was ever going to be able to do it
[26069.48s -> 26073.96s]  somebody did it and they didn't know what to do because they didn't have a jet
[26074.68s -> 26081.94s]  right am i remembering this correctly yeah they got sued and they got a monetary prize instead yep
[26084.12s -> 26090.14s]  that's so funny some dude ended up with 10 000 pepsi uh 10 million pepsi points whatever
[26090.78s -> 26109.59s]  how would you get that many got sued over it but no i'll have something stupid maybe
[26110.39s -> 26114.55s]  maybe you can redeem like 10 000 channel points and i'll like turn my face cam on and like give
[26114.55s -> 26119.91s]  you a wink although that would probably get kind of annoying you would have to be high enough
[26119.91s -> 26133.34s]  where it would not ruin every stream so it would only happen like once in a while but anyways uh
[26133.34s -> 26136.78s]  thank you tingy for the 250 it sucks that i wasn't able to join the server but the stream was
[26136.78s -> 26140.86s]  enjoyable nonetheless hopefully in the future everything will be sorted tons of love to you
[26140.86s -> 26149.22s]  and the devs for putting so much work into this yeah once we actually get it off the ground
[26150.81s -> 26159.21s]  i at least want to do i want to do one or two of them at least with all the rules in place and
[26159.21s -> 26167.05s]  all the stuff in place last night is not an indicator of how those streams are going to go
[26171.53s -> 26177.70s]  so just you know be aware of that peaceful hailey thanks for the 250 hey germa so glad
[26177.70s -> 26182.10s]  you were doing a minecraft stream it was a ton of fun the two times i got in but i can't wait till
[26182.10s -> 26186.66s]  we get twitch authorization in so we can have organized fun but this was still awesome happy
[26186.66s -> 26191.82s]  i got to play in the server with you in chat have a good night yeah because it was there was like
[26191.82s -> 26196.36s]  you said there was no white list it was anyone with minecraft could just join that server
[26197.24s -> 26205.45s]  we had two there's like three four servers yeah we just we got this kinks to work out and i knew
[26205.45s -> 26216.01s]  that was gonna happen should be fun once we get it truly off the ground though oh also important
[26216.73s -> 26220.81s]  over the next couple of days because we're getting to the end of the year here
[26224.01s -> 26230.39s]  there's going to be uh i feel like once every two or three weeks there's another channel that
[26230.39s -> 26234.79s]  gets opened up into the discord i have more channels in my discord than i think most people
[26234.79s -> 26240.81s]  do i just open up new channels every fucking week there will be a new channel in the discord
[26240.81s -> 26248.81s]  to discuss nominations for the end of the year for the new year's eve stream i want to get that
[26248.81s -> 26260.74s]  ball rolling because i want to be able to get the nomination videos ready and not scramble to get
[26260.74s -> 26267.94s]  them done in three days like last year so expect some nomination discussions i am going to put
[26268.98s -> 26275.69s]  a pinned message in there to make sure that people know the nominations and you can discuss
[26275.77s -> 26290.73s]  them and nominate stuff that stream feels like it was yesterday yeah that was almost one full year
[26290.73s -> 26315.93s]  ago 365 days ago do your best to ignore the pin the passage of time yeah but uh volemy gave five
[26315.93s -> 26320.97s]  thousand bits fifty dollars yesterday and want to make sure i talk about it because that's a lot of
[26320.97s -> 26325.85s]  money to give and have not been addressed they said chat now is the time to rise up viva la
[26325.85s -> 26330.73s]  revolution i may have even caught it but i don't think i did and i want to make sure i did
[26330.73s -> 26341.29s]  i was kind of locked in thank you volemy sad vega thanks for the 250 i can't believe what a violent
[26341.29s -> 26345.77s]  wretched king you became so quickly mad with power telling people to die simply for voicing
[26345.77s -> 26353.70s]  their opinions about bread and the king's age your kingdom starves and you cackle with glee
[26354.58s -> 26375.38s]  uh did i you know did i cackle all right this is not even this uh this is really this is really
[26375.38s -> 26380.34s]  fucking funny this one this is not at the the bit threshold but i'm going to read it because this
[26380.34s -> 26391.26s]  is actually really funny um it's just funny this is funny ultra levin said i managed to throw an
[26391.26s -> 26398.14s]  egg at you and land it three times the first time it almost crashed the server i got really worried
[26403.08s -> 26410.87s]  throwing an egg and going oh shit did i do that it did crash the server oh yeah because there
[26410.87s -> 26417.40s]  were chickens that were spawned everywhere right yeah it spawned five chickens and the server went
[26417.40s -> 26429.72s]  down that's right i'm surprised at what you guys would have could accomplish and like all right
[26429.72s -> 26435.96s]  let's be real here the amount of stuff that you guys did i didn't even know what's going on outside
[26435.96s -> 26441.78s]  the community i was we would we were like killing people and i was trying not to die and we were
[26441.78s -> 26447.34s]  walking around i was putting people in fighting pits and shit and then we walk around the
[26447.34s -> 26453.14s]  community there's like a whole this is like farms that were done there was a secret town
[26453.94s -> 26470.28s]  i was just running around like an idiot make a more static secondary server yeah i i'm trying
[26470.28s -> 26474.60s]  to toy with the idea that if this goes well for a couple times we just have fun for a few
[26474.68s -> 26486.39s]  like the event the event of permadeath and fighting and taking on each other and having
[26486.39s -> 26492.71s]  stuff happen and if you die you're out and come fuck the king right it might actually be kind
[26492.71s -> 26498.95s]  of fun just to have i can i'm not going to guarantee to have something like this permanently
[26499.91s -> 26511.42s]  right but like you still have a secondary server that's not as big that's just a for fun server
[26514.90s -> 26520.47s]  it may be like to have it up for like a few months and just have people go in and play and
[26520.47s -> 26525.11s]  do whatever they want and just put some interesting rules on it and then we could go in and you know
[26525.11s -> 26532.74s]  take a take a look at it every now and then but i don't i don't know last time i did that i had
[26532.74s -> 26538.02s]  a tf2 server for a while and it just i just couldn't manage it and i would have to like
[26538.02s -> 26544.10s]  bring on people to manage it and keep them around and they'd have to be the ones managing everything
[26545.14s -> 26550.38s]  they would have to be people that were like on call to run that server and i don't know if i
[26551.02s -> 26559.72s]  am ready to make that commitment right now because there's a bunch of other stuff that
[26559.72s -> 26563.48s]  i currently want to do and i wouldn't be able to keep up with it really at all
[26564.44s -> 26573.14s]  just make your mods do it no i would why would i do that hey all right now you guys now have to
[26573.14s -> 26581.70s]  manage a minecraft server thanks bye the mods are people man they got stuff going on they got
[26581.70s -> 26609.13s]  shit to do they live lives why would i want to tell them to do that volunteers um yeah anybody
[26609.13s -> 26615.66s]  that volunteers time to help run a community i'm not going to be like oh hey thanks oh by the way
[26616.06s -> 26620.70s]  you're doing this stuff do this now too but and for free as well do that for free
[26622.58s -> 26629.37s]  manage my entire minecraft community every day no i'm not going to do that
[26630.09s -> 26642.73s]  jerma they're saying there's volunteers for the minecraft server yeah i mean maybe some some of
[26642.73s -> 26646.17s]  you guys were into it and interested but we would have that to be a process to pick that you know
[26647.21s -> 26654.81s]  i wouldn't want just to be like it would have to maybe we'll go and get into that another time
[26655.29s -> 26663.34s]  let's keep going almost done with yesterday and then we'll go through the next day quick

[26883.66s -> 26892.18s]  minecraft i mean it could be fun if look if i'm gonna have a server that can hold more than 200
[26892.18s -> 26897.93s]  people at the same time maybe it'll be fun before i get rid of this server to just get a bunch of
[26897.93s -> 26903.05s]  people on and build a dirt dick like the biggest dirt dick that anyone's ever built in minecraft i
[26903.05s -> 26911.03s]  don't know because i mean i mean this the server the server is fairly expensive so i'd like to use

[26987.10s -> 26994.54s]  temperature does it have to be so we're going to watch this video on stream i know everyone's
[26994.54s -> 27002.28s]  tired and wants to go to bed but we're watching this video on stream right now i have no idea what

[27068.18s -> 27072.34s]  i get it what temperature does it have to be set at it's a fucking fart roast you can't screw it
[27072.34s -> 27079.70s]  up get out i'm doing a video what's the i need to get out oh jeez hello ladies and gentlemen

[27118.70s -> 27123.74s]  don't think i want to play fucking frog people we're playing as a fucking frog man i'm not even
[27123.74s -> 27129.50s]  going to go any further on the characters so what you do in minecraft is it's pretty simple
[27129.50s -> 27134.54s]  you go around or you collect resources and you fight months what the hell is it what the
[27134.54s -> 27139.98s]  fuck is this what is going on here what is this a ninja turtles what the fuck are the ninja turtles
[27139.98s -> 27148.47s]  doing in this game look it's leonardo let's turn it tell him behind him what are you doing this game
[27149.51s -> 27157.11s]  i don't i have no what am i supposed to even be doing does anybody know what you do in this game
[27157.11s -> 27162.79s]  i have not figured out all i've done is was it a b it's a fucking b come on still true
[27163.91s -> 27169.35s]  the real awesome part about this game is the fact that i'm battling right now as a frog there's
[27169.35s -> 27174.39s]  never been a game in existence where you could fight people as frogs it just never existed
[27174.39s -> 27179.11s]  and that's why i like it and that's the f5 experience points right there ladies and
[27179.11s -> 27185.06s]  gentlemen i just figured out how to play cube world i'm concerned about the people who made
[27185.06s -> 27189.38s]  this game because they're gonna get fucking sued first this is ninja turtles and then look
[27189.38s -> 27194.50s]  it's the seven dwarfs disney is gonna have a field day with these guys i look at a snuffy
[27194.50s -> 27199.94s]  that's gruffy that's poopy and snoopy see that's the seven dwarfs how are they not gonna get
[27199.94s -> 27205.22s]  sued by this there's funny i i really am concerned i'm gonna let me go get a closer look here
[27205.22s -> 27214.26s]  all right fluffy you need to go back to disney world because i said so what what
[27215.14s -> 27220.18s]  actually that was actually pretty surprising the seven dwarfs didn't have those fucking powers
[27220.90s -> 27229.54s]  oh would you look who it is everybody it's donatello by himself without his boys hey donnie
[27229.54s -> 27234.58s]  how are you how are the rest of the ninja turtles yeah without them you aren't so fucking tough now

[27513.40s -> 27536.87s]  in this video do people still do that they don't still do that do they they do i thought that if
[27536.87s -> 27544.46s]  not time would have gone by are people still giving away xboxes but now you go to ring a bell too
[27545.10s -> 27561.50s]  they give away iphones now i remember doing a giveaway before i remember i gave away like a mouse
[27562.86s -> 27571.34s]  i wonder if this person is still around in the community because i i got a mouse and i remember
[27571.34s -> 27578.79s]  given it was like a razor it was one of the razor mice it had nothing to do there was no like
[27578.79s -> 27583.27s]  sponsorship it was just like i had this mouse and i was like oh fuck i got i i think i didn't
[27583.27s -> 27592.98s]  want it or i didn't like it or something i think maybe i bought i had two of them i don't remember
[27592.98s -> 27601.29s]  what it did it was like 10 years ago but i i mailed somebody a mouse i wonder if that person's still
[27601.29s -> 27611.62s]  around i wonder what if the way that if they still have that mouse do you ever miss the old early
[27611.62s -> 27622.18s]  days yeah sometimes but it's i mean it's like a different mindset though sometimes you know i
[27622.18s -> 27628.36s]  miss like making these old the little youtube videos you know i like the ones from like 2012
[27630.38s -> 27641.11s]  i think it was it was a lot simpler back then in regards to like grandpa's gonna just
[27641.91s -> 27648.33s]  do a cube world video and if i'm gonna get like chased around by monsters for two minutes you
[27648.33s -> 27658.65s]  know what i mean it was just like yeah it was just like kind of simple but if we're talking like
[27658.65s -> 27663.61s]  2011 2012 i mean that that's just the kind of videos people were making it's videos i thought
[27663.61s -> 27671.61s]  were fun and interesting 20 like 14 15 16 is when i really started to try to make a bunch of shit
[27671.61s -> 27680.46s]  that i really wanted to put time and effort into and yeah i do miss the it's just it's never gonna
[27680.46s -> 27686.49s]  come back though that that's not gonna happen anymore like 2013 to like 2016 2017 really
[27687.05s -> 27696.17s]  is like i spent i mean i stream like this streams almost eight hours long right i streamed yesterday
[27696.73s -> 27700.81s]  for a few hours i mean that typically it would be longer than that but because we would test on the
[27700.81s -> 27708.44s]  server but it's not like i'm spending less time or more time sometimes i would spend
[27709.16s -> 27715.06s]  four three four five days straight on a video you know like i i'm live three or four times a week
[27716.54s -> 27722.22s]  with what i don't know what like i average for hours a week on stream like actually turned on
[27722.22s -> 27728.92s]  it's probably i mean if i my average stream is six and a half to seven hours six to seven hours
[27731.18s -> 27739.10s]  seven like 14 21 to like maybe maybe like 20 to 25 to 35 hours a week on stream like on broadcast
[27739.90s -> 27748.17s]  if i was going to make a youtube video on a game it would probably be like
[27748.81s -> 27760.28s]  30 hours in one session to do like one video so that makes like that makes sense do i have
[27760.28s -> 27766.02s]  an alternate path in case twitch doesn't work out well here's the thing about that question twitch
[27766.02s -> 27780.87s]  already has worked out a lot so it's not like oh i i have i have plans when i don't know whenever
[27780.87s -> 27785.59s]  this starts to people start to lose interest i i have like little contingency plans of what i want
[27785.59s -> 27796.33s]  to do but i don't i wouldn't look back and be like oh man this didn't work out i'm doing something
[27796.33s -> 27803.19s]  that i've wanted to do my whole life i've already i've already achieved my dreams
[27804.54s -> 27812.31s]  of just doing stuff like this so i would never look back and be like oh damn like let's say this
[27812.31s -> 27816.39s]  over the next few years let's say viewership drops or you know it's okay well that's
[27817.43s -> 27824.57s]  whatever you know i i i did everything i wanted to do in regards to like audience level and
[27825.21s -> 27833.02s]  engagement with people and but i don't even i don't even look at it like that seriously like
[27833.02s -> 27838.66s]  whatever happens tomorrow i have to see what happens tomorrow two or three weeks from now
[27838.66s -> 27846.41s]  we'll see i don't know i'm just riding the wave and just doing it for fun and just trying to stay
[27846.41s -> 27850.25s]  on the i'm just trying to stay on the surfboard and we'll see where the where the water goes i
[27850.25s -> 27864.87s]  have no idea you're the number one jump king streamer on twitch i don't think that's true i
[27864.87s -> 27870.07s]  think a lot of uh big streamers have played jump king i don't i think i'd be pretty far down on
[27870.07s -> 27882.25s]  that list so i don't know about that probably not even now right but it's always nice to reminisce
[27882.25s -> 27888.41s]  and i do forget some things what is this germa sandler oh can anybody i before i we have like
[27888.41s -> 27894.65s]  bits to do but what's that uh can i can i get to somebody leave you some fucked up clips from

[28141.40s -> 28145.00s]  stream in my opinion was seeing what the community build i would love a community server that you
[28145.00s -> 28151.80s]  visit every month or so that's maybe we'll see maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe i don't know

[28169.90s -> 28180.71s]  from yesterday this was the worst stream since the surge which which day are they talking about
[28180.71s -> 28188.25s]  they're talking about today or yesterday uh with some tweaking of the guards and fixing
[28188.25s -> 28201.00s]  hardcore this will be sick as hell yes i know no stream is as bad as the surge was the surge is
[28201.96s -> 28206.44s]  it was the that was one of the worst just that that really was the worst stream i probably ever
[28206.44s -> 28213.30s]  did i don't remember it that's because it was so awful that you you just refused to acknowledge
[28213.30s -> 28223.64s]  it existed the surge wasn't funny even in like a pity way no i know it was horrible it was awful

[29110.97s -> 29115.59s]  is that just like an ad was that an ad did i get added i think i might have been i think i got
[29115.59s -> 29124.90s]  baited by the ad is that is that really happening is coke gaming like giving community subs to
[29124.98s -> 29133.86s]  people like subway was i don't know you have to be partnered oh you have to get partnered
[29134.66s -> 29147.56s]  oh so it's like a coke gaming partners you on twitch sort of thing oh i see okay for i i don't
[29147.56s -> 29151.80s]  know why but i thought it was just coke gaming was going into random streams and just dropping
[29151.80s -> 29235.74s]  subs and stuff with like a message like this you can always tell when a brand doesn't give a shit
[29235.74s -> 29243.34s]  if they literally get your name wrong in what they're doing or if they just pick a random
[29243.34s -> 29257.48s]  video or a random stream that you've ever done dude germa we here at brand so so much loved

[29299.29s -> 29303.53s]  don't like i have i'm not like a fan of rats that's a reference to a video i made in a shitty
[29303.53s -> 29308.01s]  animation program you didn't see it though you think i actually have rats in my house

[29336.95s -> 29350.90s]  i oh look i have to say this because when will we ever evolve advertising and like pr
[29350.90s -> 29358.82s]  shit why does it have to be the same way that it's just been forever like that shit nobody
[29358.82s -> 29368.34s]  that doesn't work nobody gives a shit about that like that it doesn't do anything for anybody
[29369.70s -> 29377.59s]  we need to change the way that we advertise because the current system is just annoying
[29379.82s -> 29393.64s]  don't you want your brand to not be associated with i'm fucking irritating you sound like a
[29393.64s -> 29406.47s]  ted x talker they're literally all out of touch it's just gonna get worse do your own advertising
[29406.47s -> 29415.96s]  and get paid for it are the advertising needs to be i don't i just feel like random video ads just
[29415.96s -> 29429.82s]  don't do it anymore modern advertising is just dude relatable yeah but it's dude relatable with
[29429.82s -> 29436.63s]  like a 30 year old medium that they're trying to still do it's dude relatable but with tactics
[29436.63s -> 29443.59s]  that we've been doing since the 60s you can't be dude relatable when you're not at all and you're
[29443.59s -> 29459.86s]  using marketing strategies from 1965 what's something that i recently bought from an ad
[29461.91s -> 29475.32s]  um i don't know not nothing on the internet because it seems like all internet ads
[29476.20s -> 29482.14s]  are for like jokey food companies that i'm not going to eat you know what i mean most of the
[29482.14s -> 29490.60s]  online ads are weird shitty mobile games that nobody wants to play and 600 calorie per serving
[29491.77s -> 29510.10s]  like garbage can fucking food i don't i don't that doesn't appeal to me at all and cars
[29511.42s -> 29521.93s]  yeah and cars you should do a stream where we watch ads and then rate them well found the
[29521.93s -> 29531.96s]  fucking account found found the like the hidden advertising account here oh dude yeah it's so
[29531.96s -> 29539.05s]  fucked up you should watch a bunch of ads on money stream that would be like crazy right epic
[29539.05s -> 29546.78s]  yeah because you're epic but may i recommend some coke ads uh maybe if you think that would be cool
[29547.80s -> 29553.48s]  i they made a few good ones i think recently there are some very cool racing coke ads you
[29553.48s -> 29567.32s]  should check them out all right let's go let's go i i could sit here all day and talk about brands
[29567.32s -> 29577.51s]  and advertising even i don't i never ran ads on this stream ever unless it was like a joke
[29577.51s -> 29584.86s]  because like i don't what i don't care if i'm gonna something good if someone's gonna advertise to you
[29584.86s -> 29590.70s]  it's gonna be me you know what i mean i want you to hear it from my mouth i want you to hear it from
[29590.70s -> 29620.65s]  me anybody getting ad uh i don't think i get ad i i don't think my ads work on this channel
[29623.32s -> 29632.31s]  i don't think they do i've tried to run ads no they don't i don't i i have tried to run an ad
[29632.31s -> 29638.76s]  from my dashboard it's running right now it says 28 seconds remaining did they remove my ads can
[29638.76s -> 29648.50s]  i no longer send ads to anybody if i said this too many times it's saying this is 15 seconds
[29648.50s -> 29657.82s]  remaining all right okay 12 seconds why did i lose the ability to run ads on my channel
[29660.17s -> 29681.96s]  three two one complete okay welcome back um did anybody see an ad no no no okay so
[29681.96s -> 29690.25s]  hey twitch i just i just want to make sure that you have twitch like twitch listen to me um
[29692.31s -> 29701.96s]  if i run an ad this is good data for you if i run an advertisement and nobody sees it
[29703.88s -> 29710.97s]  what in the ever-living fuck is the reason for running ads what's the point of running ads if
[29710.97s -> 29715.37s]  like 75 percent of all people are not going to see them because they have like ad block
[29715.93s -> 29729.66s]  they're subbed what's why they what is this for it's more like 95 percent i i
[29730.78s -> 29737.02s]  the last few times that i've ran ads i have thought they have not worked because you guys
[29737.02s -> 29747.90s]  tell me you don't get them isn't this something else that we could do here why do we we're still
[29747.90s -> 29753.85s]  doing ads old school video ads that everyone's gonna skip anyways that anyone everyone is going
[29753.85s -> 29771.51s]  to just not see because they block them i don't get it i don't get it hey guys let's do another
[29771.51s -> 29779.70s]  one why are we talking about ads it's important stuff i want you to i want you to be aware of it
[29780.63s -> 29783.91s]  no i know there's it like this for like the for like the 10 percent of you that actually get
[29783.91s -> 29798.22s]  these i'm not going to put you through that again jerma is deprogramming his audience what
[29801.61s -> 29809.54s]  he's deprogramming his audience what are you talking about you're unplugging
[29814.65s -> 29819.37s]  i just don't see the point of running ads and twitch is like oh give us feedback on our ad
[29819.37s -> 29825.61s]  program here it is uh if there's 2,600 people here let's say there was there was 6,000 people
[29825.61s -> 29831.46s]  here six to what 7,000 people here at the peak of the stream if like 300 of them get ads
[29832.10s -> 29857.40s]  what's the point twitch there you go this is my feedback there you go feedback anyways oh

[30509.86s -> 30515.99s]  me you did that's why i didn't stop i was like yeah talking a bunch of shit and it was a little
[30515.99s -> 30521.27s]  angry and i was like what the but then you then you guys got behind me and you were just like
[30521.27s -> 30525.83s]  cheering me on and i'm like i can't stop and then i had to pretend to be normal for a raid
[30526.79s -> 30544.73s]  so and then we had we just kept going that was a push that we needed and then you talked to
[30544.73s -> 30561.21s]  yourself immediately after very normal you pretend to be normal every raid do i he does
[30565.26s -> 30572.71s]  what do you mean what is that but what does that mean you go into tuber mode

[31030.20s -> 31035.40s]  does one page uh and then we say it out loud kind of like you guys remember how much fun that was
[31036.04s -> 31040.36s]  when we would uh you'd go around the classroom and everyone would read like two paragraphs and
[31040.36s -> 31044.52s]  it was the dumbest fucking thing on earth and for some reason the teacher thought that that was a
[31044.52s -> 31051.56s]  good idea to have everybody not be able to do any reading comprehension and have like 25 to 30
[31051.56s -> 31056.12s]  people all read out loud in different voices for different characters i loved it when it got to my
[31056.12s -> 31060.76s]  part because i would just i was always hoping there would be a quote you know what i mean
[31060.76s -> 31064.28s]  because it was like oh and then that person said i would just put on voice on i'd be like
[31064.28s -> 31072.04s]  get out of here you you bastard and everyone would go whoa that was such a good what easy to do voices
[31072.04s -> 31077.94s]  and i'm like yeah i gotta bow and i gotta bow and then i get up and i teach the class
[31078.58s -> 31085.37s]  and the teacher sits down starts listening to me see germa has lost the germa germa's having a
