[1.34s -> 20.82s]  All right, so what's the plan? PC gaming show trailers? What were the trailers that were worth
[20.82s -> 30.92s]  watching? Play Five Nights at Freddy's VR. I could probably, okay, instead of a top five list of
[30.92s -> 34.84s]  things to do, I'll give you a top five list of things I'm not going to do, and that's number
[34.84s -> 48.15s]  one. Okay, um, let me see what are some of the trailers that I missed from earlier. Let's see,
[48.23s -> 62.38s]  PC gaming show. PC gaming show trailers. Let's just put, maybe there's a compilation. Anybody,
[62.38s -> 72.31s]  is there a compilation? I didn't see any of it. I heard that like Terraria broke or something,
[72.31s -> 96.04s]  right? Play Uno. I'm not going to play Uno. Oh, is it like a site that has it all? Oh,
[96.04s -> 106.12s]  geez. Okay. Uh, oh God, there's a ton of random shit on this website, huh?
[106.92s -> 115.72s]  Play Uno. I don't even, I don't know how to play Uno. I've never played Uno before,
[115.72s -> 132.89s]  maybe twice in my whole life. Play Just Dance. Man Eater. All right, hold on. Wait, wait, I'm
[134.01s -> 142.38s]  messing this up myself. I gotta get this on screen and we'll go through it together.
[143.02s -> 159.88s]  So I just click on one of these and then we just, we go. Oh shit, this is pretty nifty.
[159.88s -> 175.27s]  This is a cool website. The tweet, no, I saw the tweet. I talked about it already.
[181.19s -> 190.54s]  I have talked about the tweet already. It's like from like this worst joke from yesterday,
[190.54s -> 199.10s]  but it's all right. Let me do this and get this on screen and then we start interacting with it.
[199.10s -> 218.23s]  Did it work? Hey, look at that. So now I should be able to do this, right?
[218.87s -> 243.72s]  So this is from, can I not? Oh shit. Oh, Ray-Ban. I fucked it up. Watch myself
[243.80s -> 249.62s]  watching the conference. No, this is, I don't, let's move on from this. What am I going to open
[249.62s -> 260.71s]  right now? I don't, it didn't have any plan. Okay. Actually, I can do this. This'll work. This'll
[260.71s -> 289.03s]  work. This'll work. I got it. I got it. I got it. Everyone, everyone can relax. I got it. There
[289.03s -> 297.88s]  it is. You see it? You can see that, right? Oh, there we go. I don't know why that wasn't
[297.88s -> 326.65s]  working before. Everything's under control. Hey, this ain't my first rodeo. Okay. This
[326.65s -> 332.52s]  needs to be moved a little. I don't know why. What the hell are you doing? Fuck it.
[332.52s -> 341.11s]  Whatever. Whatever. All right. So let's go back here. So I, this is the midnight ghost
[341.11s -> 355.53s]  hunt. This is just from earlier today, right? Shave your head on stream. I don't think I will.
[355.53s -> 364.74s]  All right. Let's try midnight. You guys want, you guys want to decide what trailer I watch?
[364.74s -> 371.26s]  I'm going to just watch them. There's no like pick which one I'm going to watch. Midnight
[371.26s -> 393.86s]  ghost hunt. Here we go. Wait, you get to like haunt objects.
[402.22s -> 406.73s]  This is prop hunt. It's actually prop hunt.
[409.82s -> 413.58s]  Somebody decided to finally make a game about this six years later.
[423.42s -> 443.08s]  Oh my God. That's unbelievable actually that it took this long. People still play this?
[448.62s -> 458.90s]  Yeah. Sign up for the alpha. More videos. Well, we don't need more videos. Wait, there's more.
[467.96s -> 476.14s]  Something like this could be really, people could get really, really into. Okay. That's that
[476.14s -> 483.37s]  one. That was midnight ghost hunt. Seems pretty fun. If you like prop hunt, you probably like
[483.37s -> 494.28s]  that one. Unexplored to the Wayfarer's legacy. Is this a VR game? Let us click. Are you guys
[494.28s -> 497.48s]  going to riot in here? Is that what's going to happen? You're just freaking out about this.
[504.38s -> 507.82s]  I took away these privileges for a very specific reason because people were being very,
[507.82s -> 516.78s]  very inappropriate with me. All right. Don't make me take it away again.
[519.78s -> 523.86s]  By the way, I'm going to skip things that I don't really care that much about
[524.90s -> 530.62s]  because I get my, you know, I get to look for, I'm going to give you, for instance,
[530.62s -> 534.62s]  I don't really, I don't care about mutants year zero. So I'm not going to click it.
[535.18s -> 538.78s]  So just be aware of that. I'm not going to watch it because I don't really, that doesn't,
[539.02s -> 542.78s]  I'm not into it. I can, it's like a, I got a TV channel changer in the hand of my remote.
[544.01s -> 558.49s]  All right. Fine. Go ahead. Go away from me. I'm going to have watched that one anyways.
[561.42s -> 566.46s]  I'm like, what's the, okay. Let me be honest with you here. What's the point of the smart
[566.46s -> 571.32s]  clicks? If one, two, three, four, five, six, it's like spread out. I'm going to
[571.32s -> 586.02s]  watch them all except for mutant year zero. Wait, there's another page. Oh Jesus.
[588.44s -> 599.18s]  Uh, well, we already did this. I saw this. I'm just going to watch them all. I'm just,
[599.18s -> 601.82s]  okay. I'm going to watch the ones that I don't know anything about. You ready?
[602.82s -> 606.18s]  All right. So I watched Terraria because you guys picked Terraria and then I'll show you.
[606.18s -> 610.98s]  Ready? Interested in this one. All right. I already know what that one is. Uh, I don't
[610.98s -> 614.42s]  play into the gungeon, but probably fun. Not going to be watching that one. So we got one
[615.06s -> 618.10s]  carrying. I'll watch this one. Messenger picnic panic. I don't know what it is.
[618.10s -> 621.22s]  Looks interesting. Maybe I'll watch it. My friend, Pedro, I guess I'll watch that one.
[621.22s -> 627.88s]  Borderlands two DLC. I have no interest of watching this. So no, uh, the final fantasy
[627.88s -> 635.27s]  seven remake. Sure. Destroy all humans. Already saw it. I already logged before E3.
[635.27s -> 640.26s]  Let's start with, uh, Terraria though, because everyone wants to see Terraria.
[640.26s -> 658.79s]  Where, where is it? What the fuck is that? What is that? All right. Um, what is that?
[659.43s -> 669.75s]  I got to go back to page one to click on Terraria. Terraria,
[670.07s -> 703.90s]  let's see what it is. Is this expansion? Terraria was really cool. My only problem with Terraria was
[706.39s -> 709.67s]  I was kind of overwhelmed because they added so much shit to it.
[710.39s -> 716.33s]  Would this be a good time to start playing it? Or is it just adding a ton more stuff?
[716.33s -> 728.34s]  Like, see what I mean? Look, look at all this stuff. Looks pretty cool.
[730.81s -> 741.10s]  Master mode. Look at this. Looks just so fun and so interesting. This is someone's bosses
[741.10s -> 758.36s]  and this is very overwhelming game though. You can fly kites. That's awesome. Coming 2019. Okay.
[759.00s -> 780.62s]  That looks good. All right. What the hell is meat fortress meat fortress with the gracious
[780.62s -> 796.22s]  permission of valve. Oh, it's a, okay. Hot dogs, horses, hand grenades update.
[796.94s -> 811.40s]  We can use all the TF2 items. I'll play this when it comes out. Definitely.
[812.04s -> 827.24s]  Three meaty modes of mayhem. I might as well try it. You actually have to load this sniper.
[831.43s -> 850.44s]  I would try it. That's so cool. That is really fucking cool. That's soon too. That's like,
[850.44s -> 859.94s]  what, what, when is that? Is that like in a week or two? Dog two, dog two, dog two, dog two.
[860.66s -> 883.30s]  What's dog two? Why is everyone saying dog two? Dog two? Where is it? Dog two. Where was dog one?
[884.55s -> 899.69s]  I don't remember playing dog one. Dog two. No, I know. We already saw this. Dog two. Oh,
[899.69s -> 910.66s]  it's a raid. Oh God. Joel coming in with a raid. Happy, happy E3 everybody. Dog two. That's
[910.66s -> 924.71s]  what we say here. This website is 2019.e3recap.com. Pretty cool. You can see every trailer. It's all
[924.71s -> 930.31s]  there right for you. I hope you had a good stream, Joel. Thanks for the raid. The shitloader you
[930.31s -> 936.57s]  just dropped in. I did not see any of the PC gaming conference, so we're going to take that
[936.57s -> 946.98s]  time to look at it now. And we're, where, where, where, where, where were we? Dog one?
[947.70s -> 958.26s]  Were we dog one? All right. So, uh, where are we? I don't, I don't, I already know, but fall guys.
[958.26s -> 978.98s]  Let's take, let's do fall guys. Is this de blob? Why does this look like this? 87 fall guys in
[978.98s -> 989.22s]  the main. This looks, this is like de blob. Oh, they got a turkey. That's an instant
[989.22s -> 1009.83s]  vibe for me. Is it like Lemmings? What, you got like a hundred people and you got to get through?
[1010.79s -> 1020.76s]  Or is it like a massive multiplayer? Everybody jumped from, well, it's a death run. Okay.
[1024.58s -> 1031.40s]  How many people can play at the same time? All right. Uh, this looks fucking cool. I'm
[1031.40s -> 1042.76s]  excited about this. A hundred people. All right. I'm going to play the hell out of this.
[1050.36s -> 1057.74s]  I am absolutely going to play this. That looks awesome. That's like a BR,
[1057.74s -> 1069.22s]  but a BR that I would actually enjoy playing. Chivalry two. All right. So that was fall guys.
[1069.22s -> 1074.18s]  I don't need to see that. Uh, I don't play under the gungeon, so we're going to veto that
[1074.18s -> 1077.30s]  one. I don't really, I don't really know what any of this even means because I don't play it.
[1078.28s -> 1099.69s]  Uh, what is this carrying? I was going to say hell and then fuck at the same time. So it was
[1099.69s -> 1131.93s]  like, what the fuck? Shit. Do you just grow as a parasite? That looks, why do these games
[1131.93s -> 1147.30s]  all look better than any of the games I saw already? Why is the PC gaming stuff cooler than
[1148.28s -> 1158.66s]  guy with backpack on five times? Wait, gungeon is, it's not, and it is like a,
[1158.66s -> 1169.37s]  this is not DLC for the dungeon. It's a light gun game. Oh man. I'm going to destroy this.
[1175.21s -> 1176.25s]  Do I have to buy the cabinet?
[1182.63s -> 1196.12s]  You have to buy this. I have to buy the cabinet coming exclusively to arcades.
[1196.84s -> 1203.53s]  How is it? Oh, what? I got, I got a tax write off coming up here soon.
[1212.31s -> 1219.93s]  That's really awesome. It's too bad that it's only in arcades. I would love to play that.
[1219.93s -> 1231.42s]  So that was here. Should I click this? We're right here. Release date trailer. Let's see.
[1231.42s -> 1238.36s]  This is embark on a perfect ninja vacation. You can pre-order one for five grand.
[1240.02s -> 1242.82s]  That's a $5,000 joke that I'm not sure I actually want to do.
[1243.78s -> 1273.53s]  All that. Bosses. Yeah, I mean, it's cool. It's cool. But is it, I don't know if I would buy it
[1273.53s -> 1276.49s]  because it's not like kind of the kind of game that I would play, but it looks good.
[1277.05s -> 1286.94s]  Not sure what's going on down there. You in trouble? Not sure. Bone works? Yeah,
[1286.94s -> 1291.02s]  we'll get to it. We'll get to it. Hold on. I'm just browsing through. Don't need to see
[1291.02s -> 1295.98s]  this. I already saw this trailer before, so I don't really need to see it again.
[1295.98s -> 1302.74s]  Final Fantasy VII Remake. I already, I don't like it. Do I really need to? Is Cat Sith in
[1302.74s -> 1314.34s]  this trailer? Otherwise, I don't even want to click it. Like, is Cat Sith in the trailer?
[1315.48s -> 1322.70s]  No. Then, then fuck it. I already saw this one. The Legend of Heroes II. No, not interested.
[1322.70s -> 1332.84s]  Persona 5 Royale. Oh, I have, hold on. Hold on a second. I need to, I gotta see this shit.
[1332.84s -> 1337.56s]  Persona 5 Royale. Like, this is a Battle Royale Persona 5 game. They have like four
[1337.56s -> 1349.62s]  different Persona 5s. There's like Persona 5 Dancing, Persona 5 The Game, Persona 5 Starlight.
[1353.56s -> 1380.79s]  This is a long trailer. Do I need to know the story to care about this? All I know is that
[1380.79s -> 1395.53s]  the Joker is in Super Smash Bros. the new one. Stop watching anime on stream. I'm gonna get
[1395.93s -> 1413.06s]  DMCA clenched. I don't care. Like, maybe I would if I played the original game or something. No,
[1413.06s -> 1419.64s]  I don't, I just, I don't really care. It's probably, I, Persona 5 Royale, like,
[1419.64s -> 1423.48s]  I don't even know what it is. Lord of the Rings Adventure Card Game. I refuse to click it.
[1423.48s -> 1431.40s]  Dance Central VR. Dance Central is the hottest club in virtual reality.
[1432.36s -> 1440.84s]  It's the hottest club. This is how it starts. This is how they keep you in your room forever.
[1444.84s -> 1449.16s]  I want to play this. In addition to practice mode, customizing your avatar,
[1449.16s -> 1453.24s]  competitive and cooperative online multiplayer, we have some exciting new features coming to Dance
[1453.24s -> 1459.16s]  Central. Playing Dance Central can be a workout. It's definitely a great game for fitness,
[1459.24s -> 1464.04s]  so we created the fitness app. And the fitness app allows you to track your calories burn
[1464.04s -> 1469.56s]  in real time as well as your stats over time. A huge part of the experience in Dance Central
[1469.56s -> 1474.36s]  is dancing with the characters. Currently, your friends can challenge you to beat their scores,
[1474.36s -> 1479.00s]  but now the characters are going to challenge you. You think you look really cool in the
[1479.00s -> 1487.72s]  game, but in real life, in real life you're doing this. And finally, we're releasing
[1487.72s -> 1491.96s]  six songs as DLC. So if you've mastered all 32 on the soundtrack,
[1491.96s -> 1496.52s]  no problem. We have more content coming your way. Dance Central is available now for the
[1496.52s -> 1505.58s]  Oculus Quest, Quest S, and Rift. So pick it up. Did I get the wrong one? Did I get the
[1505.58s -> 1516.82s]  wrong one? Dance Central can be a workout. Can be a workout. I got the vibe and they're
[1516.82s -> 1521.14s]  coming out with like the valve is coming out with one. The Oculus is coming out with a new
[1521.14s -> 1526.10s]  one. HTC is coming out with like a new one. Did I get the vibe? Did I get the wrong fucking
[1526.10s -> 1539.03s]  one? All right. So that was just Dance Central, the soul keeper. I'm into the VR stuff really.
[1556.66s -> 1560.87s]  I can't hear either. I just try to turn it up. I've been betrayed.
[1560.87s -> 1566.06s]  AMD starts at three Pacific. Really? I better go fucking pee.
[1566.62s -> 1571.78s]  All for the sake of evil. I'm supposed to be watching these trailers. What am I doing?
[1575.56s -> 1582.20s]  I just peed. Yeah, but I'm pounding coffee like I'm getting paid to do it. Like I'm
[1582.20s -> 1587.19s]  getting paid per cup of coffee I'm drinking. Somebody's like, I'll give you 50 bucks for
[1587.19s -> 1596.39s]  every fucking large coffee you drink. All right. Thanks, man. Can I use your bathroom?
[1600.10s -> 1618.38s]  This looks kind of good. This looks pretty, I like this. You can ride a dragon in VR.
[1618.38s -> 1639.13s]  That's puke inducing. I can't wait. I mean, a little bit of some graphical frame issues here.
[1639.93s -> 1655.42s]  This looks really slow and chuggy, but as a game, it could be really fun. All right. I mean,
[1659.86s -> 1666.10s]  this is a guarantee on the channel game. Guaranteed. Like I'm 100% guaranteed that I
[1666.10s -> 1675.45s]  play this state to stay informed. The soul keeper VR. All right. Write that one down
[1675.45s -> 1681.18s]  because that's 100% guaranteed to be on the channel. All right. AMD starts in 10 minutes.
[1681.18s -> 1684.22s]  Was that, did I get lied to? Or is that, are they doing anything? What are they doing?
[1690.74s -> 1703.93s]  Hold on. Let's see. They're just going to show graphics cards. I guess. Should I buy AMD
[1703.93s -> 1714.36s]  like stock before this happens? Should I buy some AMD or should I like sell my AMD before
[1714.36s -> 1722.92s]  the conference? I don't know. All right. Bone works. People saying bone work. I've heard about
[1722.92s -> 1730.92s]  this in the knuckle controllers, right? Yeah. This is going to be completely outrageous. I
[1730.92s -> 1757.82s]  can't wait. This is, I can't, I, this is going to be so much fun. Stress levels zero.
[1759.32s -> 1766.31s]  I've seen like the developer video on that. That's going to be, that's going to be the
[1766.31s -> 1773.38s]  best VR game that's ever come out probably in regards to just usability. All right. So
[1775.64s -> 1779.16s]  should, should I get ready for the, can I stream the AMD conference?
[1784.55s -> 1791.78s]  Should I do it? Wait, no. Can I? I feel like there's like 7,500 people here. If I can't do
[1791.78s -> 1800.07s]  this, they're going to find out. You know, you can't like rob a bank like, and before,
[1800.07s -> 1803.11s]  excuse me, I'm telling you, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to call my mother. I'm
[1803.11s -> 1806.55s]  going to call the police station first. I'm about to rob the bank down the street just
[1806.55s -> 1821.10s]  in case you're wondering. All right. Okay. Okay. Good. That's going to be boring. We'll
[1821.10s -> 1825.34s]  make it fun. I'll watch like these trailers as well. I'll watch these, I'll watch the
[1825.34s -> 1838.06s]  trailers as we watch the conference. No one cares about AMD. What? All right. Let's
[1838.06s -> 1843.16s]  watch the zoo trailer and then I have to go piss out coffee because like that's it.
[1843.16s -> 1847.32s]  It just coffee is, I could probably drink the, nevermind and get caffeine. You know
[1847.32s -> 1861.86s]  what I was going to say. Uh, where's the planet zoo? I'm eating. I didn't say anything.
[1862.50s -> 1874.39s]  I just said, I just made a gesture to my face. We finally have the zoo that I wanted.
[1874.95s -> 1881.93s]  The PC gaming conference has every game that I asked for and I didn't even watch it.
[1888.79s -> 1894.84s]  No, there's no animal conflict in this, but there's, there's animals. This is going to
[1894.84s -> 1913.11s]  be fun. Build a habit for your wildlife planet zoo. Let your animals, alligators.
[1913.83s -> 1925.69s]  This is going to be awesome. Really well done. Those animals were very, very well made.
[1929.51s -> 1932.87s]  Yeah, that looks good. All right. What was the other one? Give me, okay. Give me the
[1932.87s -> 1940.04s]  big ones. Give me the big ones. State DLC. I don't care. Trials rising. Don't really care.
[1940.04s -> 1947.43s]  We already saw them anyways. I'm Shenmue three. That's a big songs of conquest.
[1948.15s -> 1952.07s]  People were just screaming this as loud as they could. So let's see what this is.
[1971.03s -> 1973.51s]  Why do they look like heroes in my magic gold gem thing?
[1973.51s -> 1983.50s]  Okay. Is this like a heroes of my magic three re-demake?
[1987.21s -> 2014.68s]  Yeah, this is, this is a heroes of my magic re-demake. All right. This is made by the same
[2014.68s -> 2032.26s]  people. No, songs of conquest. Closed alpha. It's a spiritual successor or like it's
[2032.26s -> 2038.47s]  based on, that's really cool. Played heroes of my magic and all of a sudden here comes a new one
[2038.47s -> 2043.11s]  that is based on the original ones. That's cool. All right. What else we got?
[2044.26s -> 2056.33s]  Telling lies. I need to see this. I gotta see the telling lies trailer. Explore a stolen
[2056.33s -> 2069.53s]  database of what? A private life shattered by a terrible lie. Once upon a time. It's late. I
[2069.53s -> 2077.53s]  gotta get her in the bath. I don't love you and I don't miss you. You already know too much.
[2078.65s -> 2086.54s]  Is there words to find the truth? It's late. I gotta get her in the bath.
[2087.50s -> 2100.81s]  Love you. I love you. What? What? I've only ever been in love once.
[2104.20s -> 2112.12s]  That was by the first story? I guess I still carry a torch for
[2113.08s -> 2124.74s]  which makes me a curable romantic or underdeveloped emotional. Disciplined emotional?
[2124.74s -> 2130.39s]  Did he just wait? Hold on a minute. I'm a loyal. Underdeveloped emotional.
[2130.39s -> 2135.11s]  Oh, underdeveloped emotional. That's over here. I'm a loyal friend. I'm up. I'm here.
[2135.11s -> 2150.50s]  You're down here. I mean I'm a little bit more put together than you. Telling lies. Yeah,
[2150.50s -> 2154.92s]  that was too many people. Yeah, you're right. All right. What was he? A couple of other ones.
[2154.92s -> 2164.98s]  There was a few more that were very, very big ones. I'm gonna piss my pants. Oh, why did I drink
[2164.98s -> 2177.53s]  so much coffee like an idiot? Devarver bootleg? I already know what it is. That's me trying to
[2177.53s -> 2181.05s]  tell you that I haven't watched this trailer but I saw it on the Steam store and I like
[2181.05s -> 2188.76s]  know what it is. Hey, no, no, I already know what it is. Notice that I never said I watched
[2188.76s -> 2194.58s]  the trailer because that would be a lie and I would end up in a fucking database somewhere
[2194.58s -> 2198.66s]  going looking in the camera telling all my fucking dark deepest darkest secrets.
[2204.22s -> 2208.86s]  Sadly, forward thinking consumers like yourself should find their way to devolver bootleg.com,
[2208.86s -> 2214.06s]  which wholly unironically forwards to a Steam page for devolver bootleg. From there,
[2214.06s -> 2219.02s]  potential users will have the opportunity to pay a small fee to download the devolver bootleg
[2219.02s -> 2223.74s]  launcher. Once the download is complete, users like you can select from a wide variety
[2223.74s -> 2227.50s]  of off-brand versions of our most popular title. Off-brand. Yeah, you can play like
[2227.50s -> 2247.27s]  off-brand versions of Hotline Miami and stuff. Enter the gun dungeon. That's cool. I'm gonna
[2247.27s -> 2254.47s]  pee my pants. I actually have to get out of here for a second. Dude, I fill myself up with so
[2254.47s -> 2383.51s]  much liquid. It's fucking unreal. I'll be right back. When even is the Square Enix
[2383.51s -> 2398.36s]  conference? AMD in one second? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2398.36s -> 2431.69s]  Let's just check in on AMD. AMD. Next Horizon Gaming. Where's AMD's actual stream? Do they
[2431.69s -> 2444.50s]  even have one? It's over? No, they what did the guy just get out on stage and like scream
[2444.50s -> 2453.46s]  as loud as he can into the mic? All right, hold on. AMD has like an age warning. This
[2453.46s -> 2459.38s]  broadcaster has indicated this channel is intended for mature audiences. All right, go,
[2459.38s -> 2477.86s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Why is it like an M rating? Is this even
[2477.86s -> 2493.50s]  working? What the fuck is happening? I have to like click the button in here. See, I told you.
[2495.02s -> 2499.18s]  Let's go ahead and get started. Are you ready? We just got here, right? Just right in the nick
[2499.18s -> 2505.34s]  of time. Okay, so look, as we just saw in the video, it's all about the porn here. What's
[2505.34s -> 2512.15s]  next? Our goal at AMD is to push the envelope on technology. And the entire team is always
[2512.23s -> 2518.95s]  asking, what's next? So whether it's what's next in PCs, or what's next in console,
[2518.95s -> 2523.91s]  or what's next in the cloud, we're going to show you some really exciting stuff
[2523.91s -> 2529.59s]  that just answers that question of what's next. So you've heard me say how much AMD
[2529.59s -> 2533.11s]  loves gamers. Why do we care about this? Have you heard me say that? We're gamers.
[2533.11s -> 2539.35s]  So we love you. And our goal is to give you exactly what you want. And you know,
[2539.51s -> 2543.99s]  fact is, you're the smartest and most demanding tech guys in the world. You're the smart one,
[2543.99s -> 2551.27s]  the smartest. Yes, I'm very smart. You expect the best of everything, the highest possible
[2551.27s -> 2559.19s]  frame rate, the most incredibly responsive and immersive experiences. And most importantly,
[2559.19s -> 2563.51s]  what do you think these days, you want to be able to play and share and have they
[2563.51s -> 2569.30s]  announced anything yet across every platform and to deliver that incredible gaming experience,
[2569.30s -> 2572.74s]  you actually need two things, breakthrough hardware, hold on, don't announce it yet.
[2573.70s -> 2580.02s]  Hold on, I need to put like $40 on AMD. Come on. How much is an AMD? How much is one AMD?
[2580.02s -> 2585.69s]  You need these two to really be optimized together to create that next level of gaming
[2585.69s -> 2591.21s]  performance. And frankly, you know, sometimes the hardware gets a little ahead. And sometimes
[2591.21s -> 2595.21s]  the software gets a little bit ahead. But it hasn't always been in sync. Okay, here we go.
[2596.17s -> 2600.17s]  It's $33 for one AMD. What do you think it's going to be worth at the end of this conference?
[2600.17s -> 2604.25s]  However, starting now, hopefully not like 12. That would be like a recession.
[2604.25s -> 2611.37s]  We have the opportunity together with our partners to bring the best technology has to offer
[2611.37s -> 2618.06s]  to gaming across hardware, software and platforms. And that is our vision for gaming.
[2618.06s -> 2627.98s]  You like that? So look, it's an incredibly exciting time for gamers everywhere.
[2627.98s -> 2635.82s]  Just take a look across all of the most exciting. I just said I wanted to buy one.
[2635.82s -> 2641.74s]  I was unsure. It's truly everywhere. Just look at every category of the market,
[2641.74s -> 2647.90s]  whether you're talking about PCs, or you're talking about notebooks, or desktops, or Macs,
[2647.90s -> 2654.14s]  or game consoles, or cloud, or now I can't, the market's closed partnership between AMD and
[2654.38s -> 2663.26s]  You can't buy anything. It's the only reason why I'm on this stream. It closed at four o'clock
[2663.26s -> 2669.58s]  Eastern. Closed two hours ago. Oh god, I didn't get any buys in.
[2669.74s -> 2676.30s]  Technology, frankly, have to make very big bets. And sometimes you have to make those bets
[2676.30s -> 2682.62s]  three to five years out. And this year in 2019, what you're seeing is the results
[2682.62s -> 2686.94s]  of some of those big bets that we actually made three to five years ago.
[2686.94s -> 2690.70s]  Oh, there goes the yacht. We bet on seven nanometer process technology
[2690.70s -> 2695.98s]  for faster and more efficient silicon. We bet on these new engines and these engines are
[2695.98s -> 2703.42s]  incredible. Our new Zen 2 CPU core and our new RDNA graphics architecture. And frankly,
[2703.42s -> 2710.06s]  we put these things together. Am I the only person streaming this? Am I? Wait, am I the
[2710.06s -> 2716.94s]  only person doing this? That's not true. I'm not the only person streaming this.
[2717.02s -> 2724.23s]  Fans. So last month, Sony and AMD's gonna come watch.
[2724.23s -> 2730.07s]  PlayStation would be built around AMD's new gaming architectures. And we've been working
[2730.07s -> 2736.55s]  collaboratively with Sony. Get excited for this. To build a custom chip based on the Zen 2
[2736.55s -> 2742.23s]  and the next gen Radeon architectures. And we are incredibly excited to partner with Sony
[2742.23s -> 2748.55s]  to enable their vision of the next generation console. Now you also heard recently
[2749.03s -> 2753.83s]  that Google announced at this year's Game Developers Conference, Stadia,
[2753.83s -> 2760.07s]  its new cloud streaming service. And this is also powered by AMD Radeon GPUs.
[2760.79s -> 2768.15s]  Radeon. Keyword. Just say keywords while you watch the conference. Then you're informed.
[2770.15s -> 2775.03s]  Exciting. Now let me ask, since we are at a three, how many of you caught the Xbox
[2775.03s -> 2782.76s]  event yesterday? Wait, is this actually not allowed? Is there any staff in here?
[2782.76s -> 2787.48s]  What you heard from Phil Spencer and the Microsoft team is they announced the next
[2787.48s -> 2793.96s]  amazing chapter. There are no staff here to help me. Is this not allowed? It's not allowed.
[2794.68s -> 2802.20s]  It's not allowed. It's not allowed. How do I turn it off? Stop fucking with me. Is this
[2802.20s -> 2817.64s]  actually not allowed? Why would this not be allowed? Wait. It's a lot, right? It's a lot.
[2817.64s -> 2824.52s]  To enable their vision for the future of gaming. So that's a lot of platforms to be excited about.
[2824.52s -> 2829.96s]  We're really excited about them, but as excited as we are about those platforms,
[2829.96s -> 2835.40s]  and guess what? AMD loves the PC platform. My audience is excited for AMD as well.
[2837.99s -> 2844.71s]  So look, for all of you who love PCs and love building your own gaming rigs and love
[2844.79s -> 2852.15s]  the best of the best of technology, today is for you. What do you think I got in my computer?
[2852.71s -> 2856.87s]  What do you think's in my computer, guys? We're introducing today what I would call the
[2856.87s -> 2859.75s]  ultimate gaming platform. Let's take a look. What's in my computer? And we're the only
[2859.75s -> 2865.91s]  company in the world that can really bring the best in both CPUs and GPUs. And it's
[2865.91s -> 2871.43s]  frankly an incredibly exciting time for us as well as the industry because we're introducing
[2871.43s -> 2880.52s]  the brand new third-gen Ryzen desktop processors. I have Intel and Nvidia. And the brand new
[2880.52s -> 2887.00s]  Radeon RX 5700 series graphics cards. And what are the specs on it? So I can make sure that
[2887.00s -> 2891.24s]  I make $47 on my two buys. All right, let's go ahead and get started with Ryzen, please.
[2891.24s -> 2898.63s]  Here we go. Oh my god, are my AMD calls going to be worth any money?
[2899.69s -> 2937.82s]  Please be 30% faster than the previous generation. High energy music. The game. Ryzen 3000 series.
[2937.82s -> 2949.27s]  What are the specs? That was some, that was like a whoo. Are you guys excited about third-gen
[2949.27s -> 2958.09s]  Ryzen? Okay, I have to say the anticipation around third-gen Ryzen is really impressive.
[2960.09s -> 2963.69s]  I mean, we were pretty excited at the first-gen Ryzen launch, right?
[2964.01s -> 2969.98s]  Weren't those great products? And we actually loved the second-generation Ryzen just as much.
[2969.98s -> 2975.10s]  I thought you guys played games on computers. But when I read the comments from you guys and
[2975.10s -> 2980.30s]  the anticipation on Reddit or Twitter or across the forums about third-generation Ryzen,
[2980.30s -> 2985.90s]  it's truly spectacular to see the excitement in the community. So our goal
[2985.90s -> 2992.38s]  is very, very simple. Our goal is to give you the best. The best CPU for every gamer.
[2992.94s -> 2999.10s]  And it all starts with the CPU core, the engine. So we are so proud of Zen 2.
[2999.10s -> 3002.46s]  Ready? I need, you gotta clip this. Zen 2, our architect, just did an amazing job.
[3002.46s -> 3005.34s]  We're watching AMD. It is just incredible engineering.
[3005.34s -> 3007.66s]  We might be one of the top AMD screens right now.
[3007.66s -> 3010.22s]  I'll just give you a couple. Don't fuck this up for me.
[3010.22s -> 3013.98s]  15% instruction for clock uplift. Okay, so.
[3013.98s -> 3016.54s]  Double the cache size for lower memory latency.
[3016.54s -> 3019.58s]  Double the cache size is pretty good. And double the floating point,
[3019.58s -> 3024.38s]  which is really gate for creative work. 15 times two cache size, that's pretty awesome.
[3024.38s -> 3026.86s]  And if you think that we're really proud of the Zen 2 engine,
[3026.86s -> 3030.62s]  when we bring this over to the product side, it's fantastic.
[3031.66s -> 3033.34s]  Just take a look at this stack. Double to double.
[3036.46s -> 3041.98s]  Third-gen, it's only 320 bucks? So we are extremely excited about our
[3041.98s -> 3045.42s]  third-generation Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 9 stack. And if you think about it.
[3045.42s -> 3047.50s]  What? Ryzen 7 processors,
[3047.58s -> 3052.22s]  8 cores, 16 threads. We have the new flagship Ryzen 9.
[3052.22s -> 3054.86s]  Aren't Intel's like a thousand dollars?
[3054.86s -> 3057.34s]  The first 12-core processor for mainstream gamers.
[3058.94s -> 3065.48s]  And what you really see here is leadership.
[3065.48s -> 3067.64s]  That's pretty awesome. Holy shit.
[3067.64s -> 3070.20s]  At every single price point. That was our goal.
[3070.20s -> 3070.76s]  That's awesome.
[3070.76s -> 3072.20s]  So let me just show you.
[3072.20s -> 3073.24s]  Don't fuck this up for me.
[3073.24s -> 3075.96s]  A little bit of numbers, okay? Let's just start at the top of the stack.
[3075.96s -> 3080.84s]  And see how 3900X stacks up against the competition.
[3081.16s -> 3087.88s]  What we're comparing now is the 3900X against the competition's core i9-99.
[3087.88s -> 3088.44s]  What do I have?
[3089.16s -> 3092.04s]  Which by the way, is a $1200 processor.
[3093.40s -> 3094.36s]  What do I got in here?
[3094.36s -> 3095.16s]  48, 49?
[3095.16s -> 3097.80s]  This is a 12-core to 12-core comparison.
[3098.44s -> 3100.20s]  And what you see is that...
[3100.20s -> 3103.96s]  No, I don't have a 4900. I have like a 68?
[3110.65s -> 3112.97s]  We also win in multi-threaded performance.
[3112.97s -> 3114.09s]  And all of this...
[3114.09s -> 3114.65s]  They're winning.
[3114.65s -> 3116.81s]  Is at 105 watts.
[3116.81s -> 3118.73s]  4900 is from 2012.
[3120.60s -> 3122.68s]  There you go. I got an i7-6850K.
[3122.68s -> 3123.56s]  I got like a 64.
[3123.56s -> 3125.40s]  More performance, less power.
[3125.40s -> 3128.44s]  And by the way, it's less than half the price.
[3131.03s -> 3131.35s]  Whoa.
[3133.74s -> 3137.18s]  Now, I know some of you have also been wondering
[3137.18s -> 3140.22s]  just how does the 3900X perform in games, right?
[3141.18s -> 3142.47s]  This is the most important part.
[3142.47s -> 3145.19s]  Wake up. Wake up, everybody. Wake up.
[3145.27s -> 3148.07s]  We compare the 3900X again.
[3148.07s -> 3149.59s]  My hands are covered in oil, apparently.
[3151.11s -> 3155.03s]  And this is across some of the top AAA gaming titles.
[3155.03s -> 3158.47s]  This is in 1080p so that we can really stress the CPU.
[3158.47s -> 3162.71s]  And you just see is incredible performance.
[3162.71s -> 3164.23s]  That's like taking a vitamin C supplement.
[3164.23s -> 3164.87s]  Very high.
[3164.87s -> 3166.31s]  You just piss it away.
[3166.31s -> 3171.27s]  Maximum gaming performance where the CPU's job
[3171.27s -> 3173.11s]  is to get out of the way of the GPU.
[3173.11s -> 3174.31s]  And is that great or what?
[3175.35s -> 3176.15s]  It's for half the price.
[3181.00s -> 3181.80s]  Now, look.
[3181.80s -> 3185.40s]  Numbers are nice, but gameplay is much better, isn't it?
[3185.40s -> 3187.16s]  We're going to get gameplay from what game?
[3187.16s -> 3191.72s]  So let's actually see a real-world use case for the 3900X.
[3191.72s -> 3193.16s]  Not just for gaming.
[3193.16s -> 3194.44s]  We're going to show you gaming,
[3194.44s -> 3197.00s]  but we're going to show you what you can really do
[3197.00s -> 3199.48s]  when you take the 3900X for a spin.
[3199.48s -> 3201.48s]  And for that, let me invite Robert to the stage.
[3201.48s -> 3203.00s]  For that, we're going to put on Minecraft.
[3204.36s -> 3206.86s]  You saw the PC gaming show Terraria.
[3206.86s -> 3207.42s]  Robert, my shoes.
[3207.42s -> 3208.22s]  Thank you. Thank you.
[3208.22s -> 3211.90s]  We've got 48,000 frames per second.
[3215.90s -> 3216.70s]  Choose 1080?
[3231.18s -> 3231.90s]  What's after this?
[3232.70s -> 3233.90s]  How long until Square Enix?
[3233.90s -> 3237.10s]  We've got like three hours until Square Enix.
[3237.10s -> 3238.30s]  What the fuck am I going to do?
[3239.50s -> 3241.90s]  I'm about to eat like fucking bread on screen.
[3252.62s -> 3253.74s]  Should we go back to floor soup?
[3268.42s -> 3272.42s]  To YouTube at 10,000 kilobits using the slow OBS.
[3272.42s -> 3274.66s]  All right. Well, which is just a quality preset
[3274.66s -> 3276.98s]  that's so far above what most processors can do.
[3276.98s -> 3278.10s]  We got a long way to go.
[3278.10s -> 3280.42s]  So I'm going to play something.
[3280.42s -> 3282.18s]  This is what a viewer would see
[3282.18s -> 3285.62s]  if we stream this game on both of these processors.
[3285.62s -> 3289.70s]  Yes, we did start the stream for the other guy.
[3290.90s -> 3291.78s]  I can't do heroes.
[3291.78s -> 3292.98s]  That'll take longer than three hours.
[3293.78s -> 3297.16s]  Right. That dollar on chapter five.
[3297.16s -> 3301.08s]  No, that was the magic of a 12 core processor for gaming.
[3301.08s -> 3304.12s]  You can do things that you couldn't do before.
[3304.12s -> 3305.72s]  The other guy with eight cores.
[3305.72s -> 3307.16s]  Sorry. All right.
[3307.16s -> 3309.64s]  So let's say I tried to sneeze it off.
[3309.64s -> 3310.44s]  I fucked it up.
[3310.44s -> 3313.88s]  Whatever. I just I just sneezed.
[3313.88s -> 3314.76s]  That's all that happened.
[3319.78s -> 3326.26s]  All right. Let me let's just hang out for a second.
[3330.86s -> 3333.26s]  I need a 12 core processor for gaming.
[3333.90s -> 3334.86s]  Do you believe it now?
[3335.74s -> 3337.02s]  I see if I can match it.
[3337.02s -> 3340.54s]  Look, we are just taking gaming and streaming to the next level.
[3341.10s -> 3342.14s]  This is what we want to do.
[3342.70s -> 3347.26s]  And now let's take a look at the Ryzen 7 3800X in action.
[3347.82s -> 3351.26s]  You know, my point earlier was that at every price point
[3351.26s -> 3353.18s]  we're giving gamers something special.
[3353.18s -> 3356.38s]  And this time we're comparing the 3800X
[3356.38s -> 3360.62s]  against the 9700K across the same titles in 1080p.
[3361.18s -> 3361.98s]  And what do you see?
[3362.78s -> 3365.82s]  Again, you see just fantastic framerate.
[3367.91s -> 3368.55s]  Well over.
[3372.90s -> 3374.26s]  He was mining buzzwords.
[3374.26s -> 3375.30s]  Yeah, that's what I was doing.
[3375.86s -> 3382.74s]  There's a Mordhau update?
[3383.64s -> 3384.36s]  No, is there?
[3384.92s -> 3386.44s]  No, but I suck at that game.
[3399.85s -> 3401.29s]  Why is it still playing?
[3401.29s -> 3402.25s]  This shit's still going.
[3404.50s -> 3406.74s]  I've already closed it and it's still somewhere.
[3406.74s -> 3409.22s]  The Ryzen 5 family is just a perfect fit.
[3410.34s -> 3412.34s]  Right now somebody from AMD was watching the stream going,
[3412.98s -> 3413.78s]  I'm just leaving.
[3414.74s -> 3416.50s]  They're like, what the fuck?
[3416.50s -> 3417.06s]  What are you doing?
[3419.05s -> 3421.29s]  Oh, I'm going to go play like kitchen simulator.
[3429.78s -> 3430.82s]  Watch the rest of the trailers.
[3433.54s -> 3434.26s]  Hold on.
