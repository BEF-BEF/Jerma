[397.16s -> 399.68s]  Except us the Gotham nuts wait
[400.72s -> 455.76s]  What is that t-rex? I just did that. You saw me do that and then the other thing we just played. Oh

[526.53s -> 553.28s]  All right. Well, that was quite the opening
[554.16s -> 575.09s]  What his arm? Oh, I thought that man's arm fell off did it. Oh
[616.48s -> 618.72s]  You'll be dead before they get here
[619.60s -> 626.04s]  Your precious family. I will slaughter them one
[626.66s -> 633.82s]  By one that thinks he can beat Nightwing in a fight. Are you stupid when they have drawn the last breath?
[633.82s -> 639.30s]  What a stupid asshole. I will burn the city to the ground
[639.90s -> 650.65s]  You won't get a chance
[657.63s -> 659.99s]  Gotham is their city now
[660.99s -> 701.71s]  Wait, where the hell are we?
[701.71s -> 706.70s]  Where is this? Oh, they did they just get here?
[707.22s -> 713.64s]  Like a fucking meteor hit there
[714.32s -> 739.59s]  Incoming transmission. Okay, if you're watching this, I'm dead. This is a code black
[739.95s -> 745.21s]  This message was automatically triggered when I destroyed the cave and everything it contains. Oh
[746.66s -> 748.38s]  Shit, this is the arm
[748.38s -> 759.41s]  That's this is like a will know what's coming won't be there Nightwing. I know you always liked the car
[759.61s -> 761.13s]  You're gonna have that
[761.13s -> 766.45s]  Bad girl. I know you are as a big fan of my computer setup. I'm gonna give that to you
[767.33s -> 792.33s]  Wait, he's not a prepared for it as best as I can. I know you have to though. He's dead. Sorry. It's come to this
[808.04s -> 810.04s]  Oh my god, I
[810.24s -> 824.15s]  Wasn't looking at the shadowing both. No, it won't take long for Gotham's criminals to realize the batman who trusted us since Jim died
[824.63s -> 826.63s]  You get to drive cars in this game
[826.75s -> 841.41s]  his base of operations
[842.17s -> 847.05s]  Some of the technology is outdated, but it has the gear you need and all of my files
[849.77s -> 851.77s]  It's just chaos. Oh
[860.52s -> 868.14s]  Many of you knew Bruce from Gotham's celebrity pages a handsome charming billionaire
[869.54s -> 877.08s]  And he was that my stocks. Oh, no
[878.24s -> 887.02s]  Batman stocks tanking. He wasn't my nephew. He was a friend a mentor
[888.16s -> 895.49s]  And a benefactor to those of us gathered here today and to those of you who didn't know him as we did I
[895.93s -> 898.78s]  Want to tell you this?
[898.78s -> 906.10s]  Bruce was Gotham. He loved this city more than he loved anything
[906.74s -> 916.06s]  He was a protector to this city. He worked tirelessly behind the scenes to bring justice and
[916.70s -> 918.06s]  equality
[918.06s -> 923.90s]  There's nothing he wouldn't do no project. He wouldn't champion
[924.58s -> 936.93s]  If he thought Gotham would benefit and I think in remembering that we remember Bruce as he truly was
[937.65s -> 946.74s]  He's huge. Yeah
[946.74s -> 949.69s]  I'm getting engrossed in the story
[949.93s -> 954.67s]  Are they doing the bat symbol with the umbrellas? Is that what that was?
[955.19s -> 980.60s]  You've always had my back at you and goodbye. Well, I don't want to be right here
[981.16s -> 1003.18s]  All right, let's get to it. Look what I got. Bye. Look what I have on. Hold on. I'm losing my
[1004.06s -> 1012.72s]  That's my window closing. Oh, there we go had it off the screen
[1012.72s -> 1023.13s]  I was offered what you'd expect in three years to agree to a vacation and Bruce turned up dead
[1023.85s -> 1030.70s]  He asked for some time. He knows none of us were there. Am I doing that? I feel like I'm doing that
[1030.90s -> 1034.70s]  What about you you let take a cane give the eulogy?
[1035.28s -> 1037.28s]  He offered lights off
[1037.62s -> 1040.34s]  He thought it'd be easier on us if he was the one to do it
[1041.06s -> 1043.06s]  Lights off. All right. He's Bruce's uncle
[1043.38s -> 1050.03s]  All of a speech let talk about a protector who works behind the scenes
[1050.79s -> 1054.70s]  He only knew
[1054.94s -> 1062.86s]  Which would be there if she suspected I can't see the anti. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm playing this night when you get Batman's funeral
[1063.50s -> 1068.88s]  Here's something else. She doesn't know she has the body of Batman's killer in her morgue
[1070.39s -> 1072.39s]  Rachel ghouls listed as a John Doe
[1073.03s -> 1077.14s]  Slated for cremation and what if the League of Shadows finds him?
[1077.46s -> 1080.22s]  All right, we're definitely gonna be diving to your leader in a Lazarus pit
[1080.22s -> 1081.86s]  He won't be so dead in turn the key
[1081.86s -> 1086.82s]  I know I have to fix the camera you want to break into the GCPD headquarters for a what-if beam
[1087.22s -> 1093.23s]  Let me fix my camera. I think my audio is screwed up
[1100.78s -> 1113.51s]  My audio is cutting out. I think maybe my headphones are screwed up. It's hard to tell is my camera messing up
[1113.55s -> 1123.98s]  Do you see that something weird is going on with my camera? Yeah, my face is like flashing. What is going on?
[1123.98s -> 1128.04s]  Why is my computer freaking out? I decrypted the case Batman sent with his message
[1129.30s -> 1135.74s]  We should focus on that. I looked it over but I would I'm playing his night wing. It doesn't look complete
[1135.74s -> 1138.74s]  I think race interrupted him while he was writing
[1139.78s -> 1144.32s]  He says this has implications that could shake Gotham to its core
[1145.14s -> 1148.54s]  deep fried ominous, but not exactly helpful I
[1149.50s -> 1152.32s]  Saw a few places we should poke around
[1153.28s -> 1156.68s]  Construction sites a quarry. He also mentioned a dr. Langstrom
[1157.52s -> 1164.48s]  Anyone know so we split up. He says it won't just at Gotham University. Not sure what is I don't have a spray tan
[1165.40s -> 1169.00s]  Let's divide up the work. We can meet at the Belfry when we're done
[1169.84s -> 1171.64s]  Get it up and running
[1171.64s -> 1182.66s]  Okay, are we ready to rock and roll here? It's the talk to Langstrom. All right. So now do I do I press a oh?
[1184.63s -> 1190.15s]  No, okay. All right gifted acrobat rapid combos. I don't I don't need to read anything else
[1190.67s -> 1222.53s]  I'm not reading a single other thing Gotham Knights bug. All right, let's go
[1223.69s -> 1236.55s]  That's so unnecessary
[1236.59s -> 1240.23s]  I'm at Gotham you what's the story so far with this professor?

[1311.30s -> 1313.47s]  my face is
[1317.41s -> 1319.25s]  Apparently this gear

[1330.94s -> 1332.94s]  Out are you guys hearing the audio cut out?
[1333.90s -> 1339.40s]  Every so often. It's like if it's like I'm losing it. I wonder why
[1340.02s -> 1342.14s]  No, I don't wonder why that's happening to me
[1342.78s -> 1350.34s]  Bad news Langstrom is dead any idea where I can find his office a tap LB when you see to grapple
[1353.41s -> 1355.81s]  I would not I'd be terrified to do that. That'd be scary
[1356.01s -> 1358.01s]  Here we go his office is no
[1359.41s -> 1364.89s]  Okay, thank you reach Gotham University Plaza. All right aim so this grapple hook points

[1381.49s -> 1391.06s]  Okay, this is a sprint. All right, what's in here? The cops didn't spend much time here. I'm sure I must have died somewhere else
[1391.06s -> 1393.60s]  This is all this office AR

[1421.74s -> 1431.45s]  All the trail

[1441.77s -> 1444.85s]  Sorry back girl, I don't know where the trail when I accidentally tripped the alarm

[1464.52s -> 1465.72s]  Okay
[1465.72s -> 1467.89s]  It's on the ground yet
[1468.65s -> 1469.77s]  Investigate it

[1485.23s -> 1487.85s]  Hi, can I jump? Oh, there we go
[1488.17s -> 1493.90s]  This is where Langstrom died. You'd think the GCPD would still be all over this lab
[1494.40s -> 1497.12s]  There's blood everywhere Langstrom was comes out in 12 hours
[1497.68s -> 1508.13s]  Yeah, it's on everything. He tried to get away. Yes 5 Xbox both series SNX
[1508.69s -> 1510.69s]  PC I'm on PC right now

[1515.93s -> 1520.37s]  Seems to be running at 60 try to leave the lab. Well, I think I think my camera is having problems
[1520.37s -> 1539.82s]  I think it's hold on a second. Why is my camera fucked up? Oh, there we go hidden mechanism crap. It's a hidden door
[1540.34s -> 1542.96s]  What were you hiding? Dr. Langstrom?
[1546.80s -> 1551.82s]  As you can see through the wall, that's cool. All right investigate
[1552.34s -> 1556.80s]  Tour investing investigate the crime scene search for evidence and uncover the truth
[1557.32s -> 1562.54s]  Use L to explore the crime scene with the cursor important items will be identified. All right
[1563.81s -> 1570.30s]  Langstrom made specific note of these dates and now I will too 20th and 21st of October are circled
[1570.64s -> 1580.21s]  What are the significance of these dates? Well, I mean that's because when Gotham Knights comes up. What if that was what it was?
[1581.05s -> 1591.41s]  Is the camera still fucked up? Oh, I know what that is if this movie means Gotham Knights comes out that day
[1591.41s -> 1594.65s]  The release date could be significant. Wait that it is
[1594.97s -> 1602.47s]  They find what to open the door which input device unlocks the hidden door. The passcode is 0 4 1 1 9 2
[1602.61s -> 1606.78s]  The thermostat could definitely double as a keypad the microwave
[1607.14s -> 1615.54s]  The keypad is modified with computer parts not typically found in this sort of appliance the display has room for three digits
[1615.70s -> 1624.76s]  Okay, let's put the password in oh I can solve it right I'm ready nice fail
[1625.14s -> 1639.37s]  How did I fail? Wait, I failed the tutorial passcode is it? Okay. What about what about this beaker phone number?
[1639.37s -> 1647.02s]  It's not a Gotham area code. It'd be something. Oh wait. Okay, so I had it wrong
[1647.12s -> 1655.30s]  So the password I could figure where the password is October 21 and 22. That's not even what that says October 20th and 21st
[1655.46s -> 1661.24s]  This is the gray ghost is in theaters
[1661.44s -> 1667.92s]  How many digits is this 1 2 3 4 5 6 it has to be this right because it's six digits
[1667.92s -> 1675.57s]  I've never seen a microwave like this before which device unlocks the door. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[1675.57s -> 1689.65s]  Ah, I've got it. I've got it Batman solve it that did it. Let's find out what secrets this guy was keeping

[1747.17s -> 1750.85s]  Langstrom's desk. Okay, what we got?
[1754.75s -> 1761.47s]  Organic material collected from various animals samples seem to be primarily sourced from creatures in Langstrom's lab tanks
[1762.35s -> 1764.53s]  Okay fatty tissue from a dolphin
[1769.53s -> 1771.65s]  Computer. All right, let's get the password. What's this?

[2044.26s -> 2046.26s]  Yeah time to sleep permanently
[2049.14s -> 2051.14s]  My camera's fucking broken
[2057.50s -> 2059.34s]  You look insane
[2059.34s -> 2061.98s]  Dude, I don't know if my camera is freaking out. It's like glitching
[2062.78s -> 2071.92s]  Okay, that was interesting. Well, the takedowns are really cool. There's probably more inside
[2078.19s -> 2082.45s]  Enjoying the fire range range attack
[2083.25s -> 2085.82s]  What did I shoot lasers out of my fucking eyes?
[2086.54s -> 2089.58s]  I shoot all night when he has lasers and his eyes. I don't know he has it
[2103.50s -> 2105.50s]  The whole building is burning down
[2105.82s -> 2120.69s]  That was cool. Like that was really actually pretty cool. Oh shit hostages. I'm coming
[2121.33s -> 2130.02s]  Look at this fellow
[2130.02s -> 2135.58s]  Where are the hostages?
[2135.58s -> 2137.58s]  oops
[2141.86s -> 2146.69s]  Oh
[2146.69s -> 2148.69s]  Dude, the flip star is actually pretty cool
[2149.74s -> 2155.02s]  I'm gonna die
[2155.02s -> 2157.34s]  They keep hitting me directly in the fucking head
[2178.78s -> 2180.78s]  Whoa, what is that? She shot him with like a
[2187.84s -> 2189.84s]  Oh, no, no nightwing's dead
[2192.00s -> 2199.17s]  What I have a heel
[2199.17s -> 2201.49s]  What happened? Oh my god. I have a new suit on. All right, let's go
[2202.13s -> 2210.10s]  There's probably more I think the feed is losing connection. I'm getting an audio drop every like five to ten seconds
[2210.90s -> 2212.90s]  I think it's I don't know
[2212.98s -> 2214.34s]  I have to look into that
[2214.34s -> 2219.42s]  Am I running out of like memory? I don't know
[2220.22s -> 2221.92s]  Well, it shouldn't
[2221.92s -> 2224.16s]  Maybe i'll turn our setting down
[2228.22s -> 2230.22s]  God, all right, that's cool
[2230.38s -> 2236.16s]  Let me turn a couple things down. I feel like um, it's something is being overloaded here
[2239.25s -> 2244.31s]  Dynamic resolution. Maybe should I bring this down and be like 80?
[2244.79s -> 2251.27s]  Two I wonder what's happening. Yeah, the audio is fine for stream, but for some reason it keeps uh, but
[2252.39s -> 2271.27s]  I don't want ray tracing on. All right, let's try this. Let me see if this helps
[2274.69s -> 2276.69s]  Yeah, because it's not coming through to you guys, but it's coming through me
[2277.25s -> 2284.50s]  Which is weird. So I don't I I don't it's not my webcam
[2285.06s -> 2290.82s]  Because i'm hearing the game audio go better make this quick and even one of that when the camera's off
[2292.18s -> 2297.30s]  I don't know. You let's see. I'm looking to see how if the camera screws up when it happens. It does not
[2298.39s -> 2304.47s]  All right, let's go
[2307.59s -> 2327.36s]  All right fire fire fire
[2327.36s -> 2329.92s]  Oh, I put it that's right. It's unhard. I was wondering
[2330.48s -> 2333.68s]  I was like my god, these fucking freaks are giving me just so much trouble
[2341.68s -> 2343.68s]  Who's yelling? Is that one of them yelling at me?
[2355.28s -> 2357.28s]  I'm fighting them right now
[2363.73s -> 2370.44s]  All right. I'm here

[2818.56s -> 2836.93s]  It's nightwing get him
[2838.77s -> 2843.24s]  Someone set our college on fire. What did I do that? I didn't
[2843.64s -> 2846.20s]  I promise I didn't set your college on fire
[2847.88s -> 2853.80s]  I'm a good guy. I'm one of the bad brick but the bad uh nights the gotham nights
[2858.53s -> 2860.53s]  Okay, let's go
[2863.67s -> 2866.96s]  That was ridiculous
[2866.96s -> 2869.52s]  I can't believe that I was getting shot at
[2870.24s -> 2876.50s]  Hey nightwing, what took you so long? Well, you mean
[2877.38s -> 2881.28s]  Can I actually stop and help?
[2887.52s -> 2889.52s]  Can I actually
[2896.63s -> 2905.97s]  This is fun. Okay, so just go through here and hopefully you don't get mad
[2912.40s -> 2948.23s]  Ripped why I feel
[2948.87s -> 2955.33s]  Why did that guy just do that?
[2957.99s -> 2959.27s]  a wheelie
[2959.27s -> 2963.81s]  I almost hit my head on the ceiling, dude
[2967.97s -> 2969.97s]  Now i'm busy doing a wheelie
[2974.85s -> 2992.80s]  Come on. I'm going for the record
[2992.80s -> 2995.52s]  Imagine seeing nightwing drive by
[2996.77s -> 3001.97s]  Nick you're on the side street. He's doing a wheelie in the fucking gotham copter or whatever. This thing is
[3002.85s -> 3015.84s]  Can I wave or anything? How do I do anything?
[3016.40s -> 3021.52s]  There has to be a way I can like interact, right?
[3021.76s -> 3023.76s]  Oh
[3028.79s -> 3040.72s]  Hey, how do I do that? How do I do it?
[3047.49s -> 3050.69s]  Why the emotes? Okay. This is I this is funny. I love this
[3051.65s -> 3053.65s]  Hey nightwing
[3055.25s -> 3065.46s]  I'm having fun
[3065.46s -> 3067.46s]  Geez. All right. So how do I get in here?
[3068.16s -> 3070.64s]  Reach the east plaza. Can I climb this?
[3071.28s -> 3085.92s]  Do I have a map?
[3085.92s -> 3087.44s]  Nightwing. Yes
[3087.44s -> 3090.32s]  I i'm gonna turn it down a little though. I feel like it's very loud
[3090.88s -> 3092.88s]  Let me know if you need if it sounds better
[3093.20s -> 3100.82s]  So you can play as any of the four characters that they get any time
[3101.46s -> 3104.88s]  I'm just choosing to stay on nightwing. Maybe i'll probably get access to it
[3105.52s -> 3107.94s]  You can play as back girl. You can play as red hood
[3108.82s -> 3110.74s]  Nightwing obviously and robin
[3110.74s -> 3135.83s]  It's sweaty right now
[3135.83s -> 3152.52s]  I'm curious about the gear apparently you can collect gear the whole thing is co-op too. So that's pretty cool
[3152.92s -> 3155.00s]  Nice work grabbing that drive from langstrom's lab
[3155.72s -> 3159.81s]  Do we have any idea?
[3159.89s -> 3161.89s]  All right, i'm going we gotta watch this pay attention
[3164.98s -> 3166.74s]  Yeah, it's online co-op
[3166.74s -> 3169.06s]  I think it's like drop in drop out. I think
[3170.34s -> 3173.54s]  Once we can get at the data we can figure out what our next move is
[3177.88s -> 3180.76s]  I'm going out. I'm not gonna sit and wait for
[3181.16s -> 3184.63s]  Whatever this shit is we're waiting for intel jason
[3185.35s -> 3187.11s]  Once we have it
[3187.11s -> 3188.64s]  Then we'll go
[3188.72s -> 3195.51s]  Uh-oh a little bit of a conflict in the team here move i'm gonna solve this case my way
[3200.23s -> 3203.36s]  Stop it. He wanted us to work this together
[3208.88s -> 3212.39s]  Whatever that's making this harder than it has to be kid
[3216.58s -> 3218.74s]  I guess since we're waiting anyway
[3219.46s -> 3222.26s]  We might as well take another look at what bruce had on mainstream
[3223.70s -> 3225.70s]  All right, everybody. Uh-oh been hacked
[3226.42s -> 3232.10s]  That must have been the secondary breaker the primary went out months ago. I thought the backup would hold I got it
[3232.98s -> 3238.23s]  No need
[3239.08s -> 3242.68s]  I've put in a small fix that should hold for a while alfred
[3245.57s -> 3247.57s]  Wasn't sure you were coming alfred
[3249.48s -> 3255.49s]  I'll always be here when you need me master richard when any of you need me. He's so cool
[3256.29s -> 3261.16s]  I'm glad you're here as am I master tim
[3264.66s -> 3266.74s]  This place does need work
[3271.16s -> 3275.57s]  Dammit we've got activity all over the city sweet
[3276.69s -> 3278.69s]  Looks like my plan wins
[3280.13s -> 3283.33s]  He's he's huge we still need the intel
[3284.28s -> 3286.92s]  And alfred can't exactly set this place up alone
[3287.80s -> 3289.73s]  Indeed miss gordon
[3289.73s -> 3291.73s]  I have a list of supplies we'll need
[3292.13s -> 3295.57s]  I could do it on my own, but it would be faster if I had help
[3296.87s -> 3298.87s]  You can count on us alfred
[3299.03s -> 3300.79s]  We'll divvy it up
[3300.79s -> 3303.16s]  Let's finish what bruce started
[3303.97s -> 3305.97s]  God give him more lines
[3306.29s -> 3308.04s]  Oh
[3308.04s -> 3315.60s]  So awesome
[3315.60s -> 3319.44s]  Open the abilities menu and spend ability points to unlock perfect evade
[3325.78s -> 3333.57s]  Uh, wait, what how do I do that? How do I do that robin? How do I do it?
[3334.37s -> 3335.65s]  Hey tim
[3335.65s -> 3337.92s]  How'd it go with the quarry?
[3337.92s -> 3342.40s]  Not well, I sweep the whole place and didn't find anything. No one's been there in ages
[3343.20s -> 3346.32s]  How are we supposed to see the full picture when most of the pieces are missing?
[3347.65s -> 3349.73s]  Bruce left us one hell of a last case
[3350.69s -> 3353.89s]  I mean what kind of person builds a secret lab
[3354.61s -> 3356.61s]  in their lab
[3356.77s -> 3358.77s]  Someone who has something to hide obviously
[3359.65s -> 3362.61s]  What what was he trying to make and who is he hiding it from?
[3363.89s -> 3367.97s]  Yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm telling you. Let's wait and see what that hard drive has to tell us
[3368.05s -> 3370.05s]  If they sell that robin raincoat
[3370.21s -> 3373.33s]  We'll get some answers. Are you shitting me? That would sell a hundred billion things
[3373.41s -> 3377.65s]  That would that would sell a hundred billion copies of this like coat that he has on right here
[3378.61s -> 3386.58s]  A hundred billion
[3386.58s -> 3393.41s]  All right. All right. Wait, okay. This is there's this is a skill tree for each character. I think
[3393.97s -> 3401.46s]  Leveling up your character rewards ability points that can be spent to learn new abilities spending ability points also unlocks access to new abilities, right?
[3402.18s -> 3404.96s]  So everybody has a skill tree
[3404.96s -> 3407.20s]  All right, so I have to get this one
[3407.20s -> 3413.11s]  Nightwing performs a perfectly timed evade that generates momentum and allows for perfect attack follow-up
[3414.88s -> 3420.71s]  Okay, so it's a perfect dodge and then you can attack cool. Holy shit. All right, well we're getting that
[3424.36s -> 3433.04s]  As you continue your investigation each hero can unlock unique momentum abilities use the momentum abilities menu to view unlock conditions and unlocked abilities
[3433.52s -> 3440.63s]  Okay. All right. So I got beat down unlocked
[3444.45s -> 3446.34s]  cool
[3446.34s -> 3448.34s]  So now we have
[3449.22s -> 3451.30s]  Did I I think it wants me to like look around
[3452.02s -> 3456.95s]  What's this one? I think i'm gonna go down the acrobat tree
[3460.84s -> 3462.84s]  Using momentum abilities restores health
[3463.72s -> 3465.72s]  Oh, it's damn good
[3466.36s -> 3469.41s]  You can chain evades
[3469.41s -> 3471.41s]  Yeah, i'm definitely doing acrobat
[3471.89s -> 3475.73s]  I'm just gonna do that for fun in front of people
[3475.89s -> 3480.26s]  Just like citizens. They're gonna be like, holy shit. This guy's sick
[3480.98s -> 3482.95s]  All right
[3482.95s -> 3484.55s]  more momentum gain
[3484.55s -> 3487.30s]  Grants an extra momentum bar
[3487.54s -> 3496.00s]  Okay, versus all defense and resistance by 10 working with allies also grants additional bonuses
[3496.48s -> 3500.39s]  Cool is oh i'm gonna see gear
[3501.36s -> 3503.04s]  momentum abilities
[3503.04s -> 3506.76s]  You just unlocked your first momentum ability
[3507.40s -> 3513.48s]  They're unique to each character and require momentum to activate when ready the ability icon in the lower right corner will change
[3514.50s -> 3516.66s]  Hold right bumper plus the assigned button
[3518.02s -> 3526.56s]  Oh, all right. So let's expect superpowers. So it costs one momentum. I got it. Okay
[3529.30s -> 3532.58s]  Exit the belfry and patrol gotham city. Let's go
[3535.08s -> 3540.96s]  Yeah, i'll play with i'll play with the other characters over the next couple of days and start tonight's patrol
[3548.05s -> 3550.05s]  After you grab an enemy what you can grab
[3555.09s -> 3557.72s]  Opportunistic crime
[3557.72s -> 3562.20s]  Tap down to display nearby opportunistic crimes. They appear as that's in the hud
[3563.99s -> 3565.27s]  Oh, I got a map
[3565.27s -> 3568.60s]  Okay
[3568.60s -> 3574.28s]  Crimes you discover during patrol can be viewed on the map along with any additional activities you have available place of waypoint

[4770.56s -> 4801.32s]  Think about okay, it'll pass 240p andy reach the morgue
[4802.24s -> 4803.76s]  Did someone knock on the front?
[4803.76s -> 4808.79s]  All right. Yeah, this is bad. Give me uh, give me let me let's wait for it to pass
[4809.11s -> 4823.03s]  Give me like two minutes. Yeah, let's let it pass. I don't want you to miss anything for some reason
[4823.11s -> 4826.37s]  Sometimes I don't know why it does this. I don't get it, but it's all good
[4827.51s -> 4832.13s]  Uh, actually while this is let me get looking I want to look at the menu watch your back
[4834.08s -> 4845.40s]  We don't need frames for this so you do it. There is gear so you can do different weapons
[4849.94s -> 4856.31s]  Wait, I I didn't even know I had these holy shit. I was I was I couldn't even hurt anybody
[4857.27s -> 4871.17s]  That's why I couldn't kill anybody there any points. I do not I know I do I got a point
[4871.17s -> 4879.92s]  I got a point. Where should I put it while we wait for this like tornado of internet to die down an extra momentum bar
[4880.24s -> 4889.06s]  Okay, maybe health right?
[4889.06s -> 4903.16s]  I would imagine probably health five percent defense and it goes to twenty percent at full health
[4903.24s -> 4918.76s]  Probably that i'll do a little bit defense. Oh, I thought I had one. No, I don't have any you can read emails
[4922.53s -> 4931.86s]  Uh, yikes, i've dropped 10 000 frames in the last like 10 minutes. Come on. Come on, man
[4933.92s -> 4941.64s]  Really? You're not gonna do it to me right now. Are you hold on a second?
[4943.28s -> 4974.80s]  You're not gonna do it to me right now. Are you? Yeah, this is bad. Am I still live? Did I get smashed?
[4978.63s -> 4994.08s]  Yeah, I think I just got like smashed out. My internet just got smashed. Okay. I'm still live. All right, cool. Yeah, there's a
[4994.72s -> 5023.62s]  Massive problem right now at this time. It is my internet. This is like abysmal. Um
[5025.40s -> 5047.20s]  Shit I was chewing your wires this kind of came out of nowhere. I don't have a VPN on right now
[5049.04s -> 5058.77s]  Well, hold on did it pass kind of god damn it. I was just starting to have a bunch of fun
[5059.01s -> 5063.43s]  I was just getting into it. Come on
[5063.83s -> 5082.98s]  All right, go get a snack go get a snack. I'll be right back. See if it will try to get it to pass
[5083.22s -> 5442.69s]  Let's try to write it out. I'll be back in like two minutes try to write it out. All right
[5443.41s -> 5445.78s]  I am here
[5446.64s -> 5451.67s]  This is the worst I think we've ever seen it in the last like few months. It's usually not like this
[5455.25s -> 5464.61s]  I played um, I mean like two three days ago played. Uh, we played uh scorn and it was fine for six straight out
[5464.61s -> 5467.33s]  No drop frames at all. Same time frame. I don't get it
[5468.48s -> 5478.76s]  Um, I hope this fixes still had like another 40 minutes or so that I wanted to play gotham nights playing it tomorrow, too
[5478.84s -> 5484.85s]  But I really want to do it tonight. I really want to play I it should
[5485.41s -> 5486.77s]  Fix itself
[5486.77s -> 5488.29s]  It always does
[5488.29s -> 5501.49s]  Whenever this happens at the very least i'm glad I got a little time in it. I'm actually having fun
[5501.57s -> 5506.74s]  I'm having a lot of fun with it. So let me play let me play
[5512.77s -> 5517.92s]  Yeah, it's still it's still happening whenever this happens for about 30 to 40 minutes
[5518.85s -> 5523.86s]  It will be an issue like this and then it just goes right back to normal
[5524.55s -> 5531.81s]  For the rest of the night what i'm probably going to do because these are sponsored streams and I obviously want to you know
[5532.45s -> 5534.79s]  Do them I don't want to make sure they're good
[5535.68s -> 5544.87s]  Uh, i'm probably going to start earlier tomorrow to try to avoid this time frame because it's always at
[5545.70s -> 5549.94s]  I mean we haven't had a problem like this in a long time, but when it happens, it's always at this time
[5551.54s -> 5558.76s]  So i'm going to pull the stream back tomorrow by a couple of hours to make sure that I avoid this
[5563.49s -> 5571.17s]  Uh streams not over. I'm just saying for the you know for tomorrow. Come on
[5574.16s -> 5591.24s]  Try resetting your modem. I it's I don't think that's the problem. It really isn't yeah
[5591.48s -> 5596.13s]  This is by far. So i've dropped 30 000 frames in the last like four minutes five minutes
[5597.72s -> 5600.44s]  That's the most I think it's ever been in like two or three years
[5601.25s -> 5605.67s]  So I don't I have no idea I could try to restart
[5606.77s -> 5610.05s]  The stream and restart the modem, but I don't I really don't think that's going to do anything
[5610.13s -> 5613.81s]  This is a pretty regular occurrence like well not regular but it happens
[5618.50s -> 5621.70s]  I feel like it's getting better from what i'm looking at over here
[5623.04s -> 5631.84s]  I think it's we may have wrote. I think we wrote through it. I think we're good. This seems like a skill issue
[5639.14s -> 5652.66s]  It's still happening, but not as free. It'll it'll pass. Don't worry. Let me tell you a story it once
[5655.59s -> 5658.90s]  was a
[5658.98s -> 5661.12s]  Man
[5661.12s -> 5663.83s]  I don't know man
[5663.83s -> 5676.02s]  If anybody from uh wb is watching right now, uh, i'm gonna i'm gonna stream the game for longer not that anybody if anybody is
[5679.06s -> 5686.21s]  Thanks dad
[5686.21s -> 5691.73s]  I was just getting into it. We were just it was just I was just getting into it with the car and the open world
[5691.81s -> 5705.33s]  I was having fun. What's your favorite nightwing comic? Oh god issue number one
[5706.56s -> 5718.16s]  How could issue number one not be your favorite god? I love that one. It's
[5718.72s -> 5720.72s]  It is 100 getting better
[5720.72s -> 5726.42s]  I can tell we've dropped significantly less in the last 10 minutes the last five minutes
[5728.07s -> 5733.25s]  I think i'm gonna go for it. I think we're okay. It's gonna still happen a little bit. It'll pass
[5738.32s -> 5740.05s]  You tell me what do you think?
[5740.05s -> 5743.73s]  It's probably still gonna happen a little bit, but it looks like it's passing
[5751.54s -> 5764.34s]  Is it as bad as it was before? I could be so moist because i'm sweating
[5774.08s -> 5776.08s]  32,000 frames dropped
[5781.06s -> 5790.90s]  Steam is just gonna come out of my ears. You knocked these guys out during brb
[5790.90s -> 5797.46s]  No, I did not these guys are already lying down here. All right, I think I think it's passing. It's gonna happen
[5798.39s -> 5804.23s]  Um, sorry, but i'm glad it didn't die completely and i'm glad it's probably gonna pass everybody
[5804.23s -> 5831.57s]  Just we're gonna pray together. Who's this guys? You it's working. Keep praying. It's working
[5832.45s -> 5836.60s]  Who's that?

[5856.37s -> 5858.37s]  Dead men's wishes don't concern me
[5858.93s -> 5860.13s]  besides
[5860.13s -> 5862.13s]  I'm here to clean up my father's mess

[5881.08s -> 5882.84s]  Why was he after bruce?
[5882.84s -> 5885.44s]  Is this a fight?

[5900.39s -> 5904.02s]  Gandalf
[5904.02s -> 5912.58s]  I just thought of gandalf again. It was funny, but it lagged
[5918.96s -> 5921.36s]  Something tells me race isn't coming back this time
[5921.92s -> 5929.86s]  Okay, i'm gonna find the body. What's my favorite soda? Hopefully the emmy found something

[5953.89s -> 5960.12s]  Which device conceals the key the tweezers 100?

[6337.46s -> 6341.94s]  Uh dick grason and then
[6347.06s -> 6349.14s]  The berry is like a like a ben
[6351.96s -> 6353.64s]  Holy shit
[6353.64s -> 6369.83s]  All right. I just gotta get out of here. Did you just actually kill me? He's cheering. They're cheering. Are you kidding me?
[6374.95s -> 6379.91s]  Yo, whoa, what did you do? It just took away shit. It took away a bunch of diamonds. What was that?
[6380.87s -> 6387.43s]  What did it just delete it from my my checking account my like superhero checking account? What the fuck's happened?
[6389.91s -> 6392.15s]  I saw a diamond get deducted. What was that?
[6414.72s -> 6418.08s]  All right. What was that?
[6418.08s -> 6421.06s]  Was the medical bill?
[6421.06s -> 6423.06s]  Dude, that was bullshit. That was actually bullshit
[6426.52s -> 6433.88s]  Okay, cool fast travel
[6434.20s -> 6446.98s]  I had zero crimes stopped one citizen rescued. What did I do all day?
[6447.38s -> 6455.38s]  I haven't been very helpful
[6455.46s -> 6469.16s]  How do you get zero financial records research into hearing loss?
[6470.55s -> 6472.55s]  human experimentation and trials
[6473.27s -> 6475.27s]  That looks like cash payouts and volunteers
[6476.71s -> 6480.47s]  I recognize some of these jerks. They're all known gang members
[6481.84s -> 6484.40s]  So langston was doing medical experiments on criminals
[6485.36s -> 6487.60s]  You're crowding me miss gordon
[6488.64s -> 6495.09s]  The hollow imaging system is back online as of this morning. So we're in our regular clothes
[6495.73s -> 6505.52s]  I forgot how sweet your setup was babs
[6506.16s -> 6508.80s]  It's ancient but it'll do for now
[6509.36s -> 6515.84s]  You and master bruce are the only two people in the entire world who would consider the belfry's systems ancient
[6518.32s -> 6522.40s]  While researching langstrom. I also called up all we've got on
[6522.64s -> 6524.16s]  One
[6524.16s -> 6527.76s]  Did somebody ask where batman is our party crusher? Do we tell him talia?
[6528.82s -> 6533.38s]  Or do you should you find out on your own? She was a match for master bruce. Do you tell him more ways than one?
[6533.54s -> 6540.05s]  The presence in gulfam is concerning. So is the fact that she torched her old man's body
[6540.69s -> 6542.69s]  We sure that was racial ghoul
[6542.93s -> 6545.57s]  His dna was all over the weapon. She left behind
[6546.37s -> 6549.65s]  I wonder why she didn't take a chance and use a laser's pit to revive him
[6553.41s -> 6558.98s]  Well, he is massive would just find talia and ask her himself
[6559.70s -> 6561.70s]  Wait, you mean to tell me that was robin
[6562.12s -> 6565.08s]  Yeah, I can double check talia's kunai
[6565.96s -> 6567.96s]  Holy shit, you got huge
[6568.52s -> 6575.60s]  You should also hit the streets find out if anyone had any beef with langstrom sweet bust some skulls
[6582.95s -> 6587.35s]  He hit the gym. Yeah
[6587.35s -> 6593.09s]  I mean seriously, he's an absolutely massive person got new intel for the evidence board
[6595.30s -> 6601.72s]  Oh cool. Oh, I got I got a point. I can't get over what talia did to her father's body back there
[6602.92s -> 6609.00s]  Good riddance going in a laser's pit once is hell who knows what a thousand evidence boards
[6610.12s -> 6615.24s]  Crack information discovered during investigation lead section features the most relevant information about your next steps
[6616.37s -> 6617.17s]  Okay
[6617.17s -> 6625.94s]  All right. So I got intel ross was in the bat cave with bruce when it collapsed
[6625.94s -> 6634.31s]  We might never know why he was there to begin with talia alghul daughter of ross alghul the demon's head
[6634.47s -> 6639.04s]  And next in line is the leader of the league of shadows until ross passed her
[6640.13s -> 6644.50s]  Oh, I was like what the hell is going on over there in favor of naming bruce as his heir
[6645.27s -> 6650.63s]  Last time bruce faced talia. He told her to never return to gotham now that he's gone. She's decided to come back
[6651.27s -> 6652.85s]  great
[6652.85s -> 6667.22s]  Great learn about your about your next steps a little chat or snitches
[6667.78s -> 6674.92s]  All right, the freaks claim robinson park as their territory once in the area use your compass to find the informants
[6675.94s -> 6680.44s]  Or interrogate the mob to find out more information. Let's do snitches
[6682.45s -> 6689.08s]  All right, let's go for this one. So this is the west end so get to the west end
[6690.55s -> 6695.25s]  Okay case file
[6695.25s -> 6697.25s]  Basic training. Oh, okay. Cool
[6699.40s -> 6701.56s]  All right, let's go do that
[6701.56s -> 6703.72s]  Craft a new melee weapon is crafting
[6704.28s -> 6706.77s]  complete
[6706.85s -> 6721.26s]  Relegation training. Oh, this is all my currencies. Oh, all right. I'm ready acquire blueprints and salvage to craft better suits and weapons
[6721.26s -> 6723.26s]  Go to the melee blueprint
[6724.30s -> 6735.78s]  I can make a new suit. Okay, a new melee weapon crafting is ready. Um, I already have better ones. Don't I
[6739.54s -> 6741.30s]  This is 10 damage
[6741.30s -> 6756.99s]  The one I have is better. Isn't it? Yeah, I already own it. Why would I craft it? Can I craft gear?
[6758.96s -> 6765.90s]  And not all right, that's cool. So I got to find a blueprint wait, I actually might have to do this for the tutorial
[6769.34s -> 6772.10s]  I do
[6772.10s -> 6773.46s]  Well, I mean
[6773.46s -> 6779.76s]  I'll put them on
[6779.76s -> 6785.41s]  These aren't wait. These are level two. Oh, you can dismantle shit. All right dismantle
[6786.13s -> 6788.99s]  Yep. Ooh
[6788.99s -> 6792.22s]  Yep, that was cool. All right
[6792.70s -> 6794.24s]  uh, I
[6794.24s -> 6798.42s]  Do I have any points?
[6798.42s -> 6803.06s]  That's crafting complete and terror. I gotta do the interrogation training. I'm actually I can't wait to see what this is
[6808.69s -> 6811.09s]  Practice combat stealth moment. I don't need to do that
[6811.71s -> 6821.63s]  interrogation training
[6821.63s -> 6830.78s]  You just dismantled the heroic for an uncommon that I screwed that up
[6831.34s -> 6855.60s]  Should I not have done that? It did less damage. Why not break it down?
[6856.32s -> 6860.48s]  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night expecting bruce to call me for help
[6863.02s -> 6869.63s]  And then I remember I thought it might have been one of you calling just now
[6870.67s -> 6875.01s]  I was worried
[6875.01s -> 6876.85s]  old habits, I suppose
[6876.85s -> 6883.36s]  That's why I thought going to bloodhaven alone would be easier
[6884.00s -> 6892.96s]  There wasn't I won't be like him offered
[6893.76s -> 6896.96s]  Bruce left some big shoes to fill
[6899.41s -> 6901.49s]  But i'm gonna do things my way
[6901.49s -> 6908.98s]  And i'll be here to support you gotham is in good hands
[6909.38s -> 6912.90s]  So if you do this with a different character, is it a different cutscene?
[6913.46s -> 6916.02s]  Or have I not opened that ability to change characters yet?
[6921.04s -> 6925.68s]  Gotham said he needs a new guardian complete knighthood challenges to unlock powerful new abilities for each hero
[6926.40s -> 6930.80s]  Including their unique heroic travel. Oh wait, you get to actually fly
[6931.12s -> 6936.35s]  Like dr. Langstrom was into some pretty wild stuff. I wish he was still alive
[6937.15s -> 6939.15s]  I'd ask him what the heck he was thinking
[6939.71s -> 6944.02s]  All right, where's the interrogation thing?
[6944.02s -> 6949.97s]  Prepare for do I have to do this?
[6951.01s -> 6956.96s]  I think I have to do this
[6956.96s -> 6968.02s]  Oh, no, I don't where is the interrogation train? I stuck it to commissioner cain back at the police station
[6968.90s -> 6970.90s]  Oh, sorry
[6972.42s -> 6974.82s]  Ah because she was fiercely loyal to him
[6975.78s -> 6980.70s]  No, because you wasn't afraid to call people on their shit including him. Is that
[6981.42s -> 6984.06s]  Actually what I have to do the training
[6991.55s -> 6994.38s]  This isn't
[6994.38s -> 6996.70s]  Physical and mental preparation go hand in hand
[6997.66s -> 7000.22s]  Here we can train the mind to prepare the body
[7001.02s -> 7003.02s]  But it requires deep focus
[7003.58s -> 7007.90s]  Let go of your self-doubt and focus on my voice. What's the hottest pepper you've ever had?
[7008.70s -> 7010.70s]  Oh a jalapeno. Oh hot hot
[7011.84s -> 7017.70s]  Time your dodge to create an opening for a powerful counter-attack. Okay
[7022.40s -> 7024.48s]  I wait I can do that. That's cool
[7025.12s -> 7032.21s]  That not perfect that was perfect
[7055.86s -> 7074.85s]  Oh cool. How was that not perfect? Nice, but don't get complacent. I leveled up, right?
[7075.57s -> 7079.70s]  I'm proud of you dick
[7079.70s -> 7082.40s]  Hey, thanks
[7082.40s -> 7088.40s]  Cool. I leveled up though, didn't I? All right. So am I missing something or do I interrogation is probably one of those advanced combat moves
[7089.04s -> 7091.86s]  I'm going to assume
[7091.86s -> 7093.96s]  momentum
[7093.96s -> 7098.06s]  Interrogate smoke bombs guard break combo stealth grabbing an L interrogation. Here we go
[7101.97s -> 7109.23s]  Hold to scan criminals and locate the informant grab informants to interrogate them interesting
[7116.90s -> 7126.08s]  Enemies can be interrogated if they've been grabbed use stealth to approach and grab an enemy. That's not grab
[7127.14s -> 7144.45s]  That is how do I interrogate? Give me a hint just what I need to know. Okay, I think I get it
[7146.45s -> 7170.90s]  What happened to that person? Okay, i'm gonna grab what do you got answers you need appreciate the tip
[7171.54s -> 7174.14s]  Cool
[7174.14s -> 7176.14s]  You're ready to move on
[7177.49s -> 7179.89s]  I'm proud of you dick. Thanks batman. Appreciate it
[7192.46s -> 7194.96s]  Oh, okay. Let's go
[7194.96s -> 7196.48s]  I have a patrol
[7196.48s -> 7201.26s]  exit the bell ray and patrol gotham city
[7203.46s -> 7208.90s]  Check your email
[7208.90s -> 7214.54s]  Wait, we're sending emails to each other. We're in the same room. We're dropping frames again
[7215.18s -> 7217.02s]  There's honestly nothing I can do about it
[7217.02s -> 7223.63s]  I I wish there was a magic wand I could wave but it just isn't and that's just the way that's just the way it is
[7224.03s -> 7228.83s]  So that's the way it is. All right. So why is he emailing me?
[7229.31s -> 7236.16s]  I have an idea. There's a thing called the gotham historical circuit that takes you to all these cool spots around the city
[7236.40s -> 7241.09s]  We should check them out. There's an app for it, but I replaced the data with bruce's files just for us
[7241.17s -> 7251.81s]  Okay, so you can got okay. I get it. So these are little side missions. That's that's cute. These are cute missions
[7252.29s -> 7259.33s]  You guys remember when bruce hid batarangs all over the city for us to find so we could practice parkour
[7259.65s -> 7267.89s]  We never found them all. Okay. All right. All right, that's cool
[7273.02s -> 7275.36s]  case file investigation
[7275.36s -> 7277.79s]  weird science
[7277.79s -> 7282.75s]  Langstrom was murdered no matter what the cops say see if anyone on the street knows what might have happened
[7283.07s -> 7291.01s]  All right, let's do it
[7291.01s -> 7293.01s]  You emailed to yourself
[7297.58s -> 7299.58s]  I did email myself. That was a
[7302.16s -> 7306.96s]  Voice sometimes he didn't remember stuff
[7306.96s -> 7314.30s]  All right, let's go
[7314.30s -> 7316.30s]  I need to do some interrogation
[7316.38s -> 7327.07s]  What's going on down here?
[7327.07s -> 7332.51s]  All right, I got it. I gotta interrogate somebody who should I interrogate?
[7333.15s -> 7335.15s]  Open the activity view
[7335.15s -> 7347.87s]  What's up
[7350.98s -> 7353.22s]  All right, i'm definitely doing way more damage with these by the way
[7382.40s -> 7383.95s]  Close
[7383.95s -> 7386.11s]  Dude, gotham city is fucking wretched
[7389.39s -> 7391.39s]  I didn't even interrogate anybody. That was my bad
[7397.60s -> 7404.13s]  Uh, give me the bike. Is there a horn?
[7411.58s -> 7413.90s]  Oh, there's like a bank robbery over here. Do you see that?
[7414.78s -> 7425.18s]  You robbed him
[7425.18s -> 7426.62s]  Sorry, wrong person
[7426.62s -> 7431.15s]  Is it the wrong person?
[7431.15s -> 7433.15s]  Somebody was running with like a bag
[7438.54s -> 7440.54s]  Oh, okay. There they go. There they go
[7451.98s -> 7454.78s]  Robbery in progress. All right, they they're stealing money right now

[10454.12s -> 10461.10s]  Whoa
[10461.10s -> 10463.10s]  Oh shit. All right. Here we go
[10463.42s -> 10466.83s]  Why does he have like a
[10466.83s -> 10474.46s]  face
[10474.46s -> 10476.67s]  kidnapping in progress
[10476.67s -> 10487.85s]  What where I didn't interrogate anybody? Where's this kidnapping in progress?
[10488.57s -> 10493.82s]  How did I not enter? I thought that was the um
[10497.98s -> 10500.06s]  All right, let me let me get one more thing of intel
[10505.96s -> 10507.88s]  So for tomorrow
[10507.88s -> 10509.56s]  Um, i'm gonna run a poll
[10509.56s -> 10514.01s]  Before the stream turns off so we're gonna start at like two o'clock pacific tomorrow
[10515.39s -> 10517.53s]  damn
[10517.53s -> 10519.53s]  Uh, and the idea is
[10519.77s -> 10522.57s]  I mean I could play crash bandicoot again
[10523.56s -> 10526.89s]  Or do we should we do something else?
[10526.89s -> 10528.09s]  neon white
[10528.09s -> 10537.69s]  We start with neon white tomorrow
[10537.69s -> 10539.68s]  neon white
[10539.68s -> 10543.36s]  Um vampire survivor's got its 1.0 update. There's also rotato
[10544.70s -> 10547.98s]  Which I want to play
[10547.98s -> 10549.18s]  We'll figure it out
[10549.18s -> 10552.33s]  breath of the wild
[10552.33s -> 10553.85s]  I don't know maybe
[10553.85s -> 10558.96s]  Oh, I want to play like a horror game. Maybe we'll play the public combo gaming tomorrow
[10561.64s -> 10567.76s]  Maybe deadly night
[10567.76s -> 10570.48s]  All right. Yeah, put a poll up what's going to be deadly night
[10572.32s -> 10574.32s]  Uh, which is public public combo horror game
[10575.37s -> 10576.88s]  um
[10576.88s -> 10578.88s]  continue crash bandicoot 4
[10581.32s -> 10583.79s]  um
[10583.79s -> 10584.83s]  or
[10584.83s -> 10587.26s]  neon white
[10589.05s -> 10590.73s]  Wait, why am I what?
[10590.73s -> 10593.21s]  They're doing like a news sec. That guy's a shotgun
[10595.87s -> 10597.87s]  Okay, get out get out don't fight here
[10600.41s -> 10602.41s]  But they're just doing like a news interview
[10602.89s -> 10604.89s]  Why did I just come over some fighting people?
[10616.22s -> 10617.42s]  Get out
[10617.42s -> 10619.42s]  Stop just okay. I gotta get out of here
[10620.91s -> 10622.91s]  I have to get the fuck out of here
[10628.68s -> 10631.00s]  I thought those were um the criminals
[10631.64s -> 10646.35s]  Give me the car give me out
[10646.35s -> 10648.35s]  Okay, I need speaking of gangs. Where are they?
[10649.45s -> 10667.21s]  down here
[10667.21s -> 10679.74s]  What's up?
[10680.14s -> 10694.48s]  All right, keep that number four alive
[10700.83s -> 10702.27s]  It wasn't your day
[10702.27s -> 10705.64s]  All right, let's go
[10705.64s -> 10706.76s]  Come here
[10706.76s -> 10708.76s]  Now give me some info
[10709.08s -> 10712.91s]  Finally, I know you had deep langstrom and i'm dead
[10726.09s -> 10731.45s]  Belfry bad news gotham's criminals know as much about langstrom's death as we do we got it
[10731.93s -> 10737.05s]  Well, we know where talia is might as well talk to her in the meantime sunday court and it's now okay
[10737.05s -> 10738.73s]  Okay
[10738.73s -> 10739.77s]  Sick
[10739.77s -> 10748.03s]  Is this a boss fight? Maybe
[10748.03s -> 10749.63s]  This could be a boss fight
[10749.63s -> 10759.58s]  Oh confirm the poll options. It was crash bandicoot 4 continued playthrough
[10760.22s -> 10761.66s]  it was
[10761.66s -> 10764.48s]  neon white and
[10767.80s -> 10769.80s]  vampire survivors slash rotato
[10777.92s -> 10779.36s]  Deadly night
[10779.36s -> 10780.81s]  That's too many
[10780.81s -> 10783.50s]  All right. We're gonna make it easy
[10783.50s -> 10790.83s]  Um, i'm gonna literally make it simple for you. We're playing the puppet combo game tomorrow, but um, no
[10791.55s -> 10795.10s]  Okay, I want to do that at night. I don't want to do that like two o'clock in the afternoon
[10795.42s -> 10802.22s]  I want to I thought I wanted to be like 2 pm in the afternoon. I want to be scary at night
[10803.87s -> 10808.33s]  All right. I've got a plan for you. Here's the plan you are to choose
[10808.97s -> 10812.75s]  Here's what's happening tomorrow tomorrow at 2 pm. We're going to start
[10813.85s -> 10817.96s]  With something then we're going to move to gotham nights and then after gotham nights
[10817.96s -> 10823.69s]  We're going to do the puppet combo game. So i'm going to start with something though
[10824.25s -> 10830.52s]  What can I play for like an hour or two? What can I play for like an hour? I've got it done
[10831.16s -> 10834.91s]  We're going to play listen. I don't even need to pull we're going to play
[10835.39s -> 10843.34s]  The vampire survivors 1.0 update gotham nights and then we're going to end with uh puppet combos
[10844.08s -> 10853.84s]  Deadly night. There you go. I'm doing who needs a pole. We already got it. Uh, i'm gonna fast traveled here
[10862.27s -> 10873.12s]  It's only a third night
[10873.12s -> 10883.36s]  All right, pre-meditated crimes revealed. What does that mean?
[10885.29s -> 10887.93s]  Uh, I want to list I want to talk because I feel like I think this is a boss fight
[10890.06s -> 10901.56s]  I'm going for it
[10901.56s -> 10904.36s]  Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest
[10910.57s -> 10917.84s]  Ooh
[10917.84s -> 10928.89s]  Uh, give me the bike and again this game is available tomorrow
[10929.53s -> 10933.95s]  It's on ps5
[10934.11s -> 10936.67s]  xbox both versions of xbox pc
[10942.25s -> 10944.25s]  Get out of the fucking way
[10944.33s -> 10962.59s]  It's time for our first boss fight. That'd be kind of cool
[10968.25s -> 10969.61s]  first boss fight
[10969.61s -> 10989.37s]  Kind of cool. Yeah, this is on pc. All right. Come on boss fight. You played as the other characters yet
[10989.69s -> 10992.97s]  No, I mean nightwing is my one of my favorite dc characters. So played with him
[10993.21s -> 10996.03s]  We'll play with the other ones tomorrow
[11002.68s -> 11008.61s]  They cast me out hard to believe leadership of the league isn't hereditary
[11010.36s -> 11013.72s]  You're saying you didn't get the job after you asked rach
[11015.04s -> 11020.16s]  My late father insisted bruce would be the next head of the league despite his refusal
[11021.04s -> 11027.92s]  Since that ill-fated welcome nightwing looks like this all the league can agree on it's like the different costume. It's a different suit
[11029.15s -> 11031.15s]  Why would race kill us next in line?
[11031.87s -> 11033.87s]  None of this makes sense
[11033.95s -> 11039.23s]  I agree. It was an irrational win. I warned him the batman would be his downfall
[11040.11s -> 11041.07s]  but
[11041.07s -> 11045.79s]  Repeated exposure to the lazarus pits breaks down a subject's mind
[11046.49s -> 11049.33s]  Eventually their true self is erased
[11052.51s -> 11054.52s]  I know utalia
[11054.52s -> 11056.84s]  Could have used your father as a puppet if you wanted to
[11057.72s -> 11060.84s]  There's something else here consider it a logical choice
[11061.56s -> 11064.68s]  A painless end for him meant closure for the league
[11065.48s -> 11068.46s]  and for me
[11068.46s -> 11072.06s]  Now they want me dead. Why do I like nightwing? I like his weapons
[11074.36s -> 11078.20s]  Leave gotham
[11080.16s -> 11082.16s]  I have other matters to attend to
[11083.64s -> 11084.84s]  lost fight
[11084.84s -> 11092.99s]  The funeral was tasteful. I'm sure bruce would have appreciated it leave him where he is
[11094.33s -> 11096.33s]  You still haven't answered my question
[11096.97s -> 11098.97s]  No, but I can ask you one
[11100.62s -> 11106.16s]  Why would an apprentice to the cowl break into the morgue? No, you weren't following me
[11108.68s -> 11111.24s]  It's an ongoing investigation. I look like a ghoul
[11112.04s -> 11118.99s]  I wish you the best of luck. You'll be needing it soon
[11119.87s -> 11122.03s]  Because once the league regains its footing
[11136.36s -> 11140.62s]  This isn't good belfry talia's got something going on
[11141.61s -> 11147.15s]  Surprising but also not is that why you didn't ask her about langstrom? No boss. That's all right
[11147.15s -> 11149.15s]  I don't want to give her any leads
[11152.11s -> 11154.11s]  All right, you guys ready to call it
[11156.64s -> 11159.68s]  Come back tomorrow afternoon. We'll come earlier. We'll start earlier tomorrow
[11163.90s -> 11172.28s]  I want to start earlier because I want to go a little longer tomorrow. Oh, I didn't even do any crimes
[11175.50s -> 11180.12s]  So harley contacted batman using my homing pigeon in a usb drive
[11181.08s -> 11183.29s]  Sorry about the internet video
[11183.29s -> 11186.09s]  It always sucks. It's always so frustrating, but it's all good
[11186.41s -> 11189.85s]  It seemed like it cleared up after like 20 minutes or so, so i'm happy about that at least
[11194.59s -> 11198.60s]  Do we think it's legit bruce never talked to me about it
[11199.32s -> 11204.33s]  When bruce worked with criminals, he didn't exactly keep us in the loop. I'm curious about red hood
[11205.21s -> 11208.97s]  But it's also not crazy to think that harley made this up and just play it
[11210.17s -> 11217.53s]  And we'll know harley
[11217.61s -> 11231.32s]  It's weird because I heard a room you were dead. Oh boy
[11232.60s -> 11237.47s]  Anyway, got you dead
[11239.69s -> 11252.22s]  Hasn't harley quinn been out of gotham ever since
[11252.86s -> 11254.70s]  You know her
[11254.70s -> 11258.88s]  ex
[11258.88s -> 11260.08s]  Killed me
[11260.08s -> 11263.98s]  Isn't that what you meant wait what?
[11264.06s -> 11267.53s]  Rumor has it she did some government thing
[11268.17s -> 11269.45s]  went straight
[11269.45s -> 11270.89s]  is
[11270.89s -> 11273.80s]  She's got something
[11273.80s -> 11276.30s]  Can we go find harley?
[11276.38s -> 11277.34s]  now
[11277.34s -> 11279.34s]  He's literally alive though. Yeah
[11281.48s -> 11283.48s]  Yeah after I got after he killed me. Yeah
[11285.24s -> 11287.24s]  It's alive, but you know it hurt
[11292.04s -> 11295.24s]  Do you think this harley thing is really worth following up on?
[11295.64s -> 11299.85s]  Maybe out of her fake fan. It's a brilliant mind
[11300.49s -> 11301.92s]  Yeah
[11301.92s -> 11304.48s]  Don't know the red hood origin
[11304.48s -> 11305.68s]  I mean, I think I know
[11305.68s -> 11309.02s]  Yeah, why would she help do I know or us?
[11309.58s -> 11325.10s]  I don't know what it is
[11325.10s -> 11328.54s]  Uh, okay. Oh, that's right. Yeah, I could work
[11330.43s -> 11334.91s]  He went to yours when you could visit his grave
[11336.94s -> 11339.50s]  Who's the original robin who's the it's red hood, right?
[11339.50s -> 11345.04s]  Red hood's the original robin like the first robin you haven't and then nightwing's the second robin and then
[11345.68s -> 11352.33s]  Right
[11352.33s -> 11354.33s]  Dick is the original robin
[11355.40s -> 11359.40s]  Jason oh no, no, Jason. Todd was the second and then who's the robin in this game?
[11360.04s -> 11373.37s]  Dick was first jason second. All right, tim right, right, right. Sometimes that is gonna be I gotta remember
[11378.24s -> 11380.24s]  All right. Very cool. Very cool
[11381.07s -> 11382.91s]  So i'll wrap it up here
[11382.91s -> 11384.91s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock pacific
[11386.01s -> 11388.17s]  Uh, we'll play more gotham knights again
[11388.89s -> 11393.77s]  Thanks to warner brothers. There's no telling what they'll do games available tomorrow and I think they'll behave
[11394.09s -> 11396.09s]  Obviously sponsored sponsors tomorrow as well
[11397.05s -> 11398.17s]  um
[11398.17s -> 11401.24s]  It's available for everything
[11401.40s -> 11403.48s]  I'm gonna keep i'm obviously gonna keep playing it
[11404.96s -> 11406.96s]  Um sponsored to play it so we'll keep going
[11408.38s -> 11412.70s]  But again, it's not gonna be the whole thing tomorrow. It will be for a couple of hours
[11414.12s -> 11419.08s]  And before that we'll play vampire survivors and after that we'll do puppet combos deadly night
[11419.72s -> 11421.72s]  That's what we will end the stream with tomorrow
[11421.80s -> 11424.81s]  It's probably gonna be a meaty one tomorrow. I would say
[11425.37s -> 11429.12s]  I'm gonna be playing three different games so
[11430.64s -> 11432.64s]  And uh strapping tomorrow
[11434.72s -> 11436.46s]  Yeah
[11436.46s -> 11440.24s]  Uh, that's it. Thanks again warner brothers
[11440.96s -> 11451.13s]  There is a there's a multiplayer too. I gotta investigate some of this shit. Yeah
[11451.69s -> 11454.00s]  See you tomorrow. Good night
[11457.45s -> 11463.20s]  Again, sorry about the internet so hard to not bite my controller when that happens
[11463.60s -> 11476.40s]  Oh, I I had fun. I did that would be lying to you if I said I didn't
[11478.40s -> 11482.16s]  Regardless of you know a sponsorship it was kind of fun to run around hit stuff
[11482.48s -> 11487.96s]  Some of the open world goofiness was I mean it was funny. It was a lot of fun
[11488.28s -> 11498.20s]  It looks like it's something you're into then it is if not, then it's not open world games tend to just
[11498.68s -> 11500.52s]  Bring out some of the best
[11500.52s -> 11504.84s]  In random ai shenanigans. I just one of my favorite things in any video game
[11506.19s -> 11512.03s]  It's just driving around and having people just react just the ai just decides to do stuff. It's my favorite thing
[11527.56s -> 11531.55s]  Yeah, have a good night. See you tomorrow 2 p.m. Pacific
[11532.09s -> 11538.96s]  Vampire survivors for about an hour got nights for about two and a half maybe hours
[11539.04s -> 11553.82s]  Maybe we'll see after that deadly night. We'll see thanks for the subs. Uh, there were a couple raids that came into
[11555.20s -> 11564.27s]  Uh, so thanks for the raids. Thanks for the subs obviously. We'll see you soon 2 p.m. Pacific
[11564.83s -> 11573.68s]  Good night. Goodbye. Have a wonderful rest of your day. Well, it's night for everybody
[11573.68s -> 11614.76s]  So good night
