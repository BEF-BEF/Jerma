[1.08s -> 9.38s]  I remember yesterday. I remember yesterday. Remember when I said yesterday that, you know,
[9.38s -> 18.86s]  I really want to start at around like three o'clock. It is the exact same time that I started yesterday's
[18.86s -> 27.34s]  stream. 3 50 p.m pacific time. The exact same time. All right, but new schedule.
[28.22s -> 39.30s]  3 50 p.m pacific. Apparently is how that has to be. No, the reason why we started later today
[39.30s -> 48.81s]  is because I gave Chad a choice either in on time stream at three or delay a little
[49.53s -> 57.00s]  and instead of Dragon's Dogma set up the insane Dark Souls 3 mods and that's what I did.
[57.96s -> 63.86s]  So tonight we're going to go through a handful about five to ten and I don't maybe we'll have
[63.86s -> 67.06s]  them on the same time. Maybe we won't. Maybe I'll just try to beat the game in first person.
[70.33s -> 78.70s]  There are a few that are on this list here, but first things first, we're going to try to beat
[78.70s -> 85.34s]  no and not. Don't say that. That's a complete lie. We are going to play Dark Souls 3 in first
[85.34s -> 93.70s]  person. It's a first person mod for the game. We are going to beat Dark Souls 3 and no,
[94.34s -> 102.98s]  I'll be lucky to get out of the tutorial zone. Am I going to suck at this game? I,
[102.98s -> 110.39s]  if you're a new viewer, I have beat Dark Souls 3 on stream twice. It's a running
[110.39s -> 118.57s]  gag on the channel apparently. I streamed all of Dark Souls 3 when it first came out.
[119.45s -> 128.04s]  Had a great time. Uh, so level 75 by the way. Give me a minute. I'll be right back.
[128.84s -> 132.92s]  You know, uh, just make sure this actually loads correctly and I will see you guys in a
[132.92s -> 218.62s]  minute. Okay, so here we are. Dark Souls 3. Everything looks pretty normal. All right,
[218.62s -> 222.62s]  what if I was just lying to you guys and I actually just loaded up Dark Souls 3
[223.34s -> 229.83s]  and I'm just going to play Dark Souls 3 again? That would be pretty dumb, actually,
[229.83s -> 234.95s]  because I already did it. I streamed this game like 12 times, so that would probably be,
[234.95s -> 243.59s]  I don't know if I'd want to do that. New game. Oh, yes. Whatever. All right,
[244.15s -> 249.74s]  let's get a character here. So for the purposes of first person mode,
[251.08s -> 259.02s]  I think we have to have a very heavy character. Dodge rolling might become impossible. I'm going
[259.02s -> 263.50s]  to need to be able to take hits. A lot of them. We're going to do shield. I'm getting
[263.50s -> 270.15s]  the biggest fucking shield in the game and I'm going to hold it up the whole time. So
[270.79s -> 274.23s]  let's get a good name here for somebody that's not going to dodge roll, that's going to eat
[274.23s -> 297.29s]  hits. No, not poop master. We got like a poop out of our system last night. And I mean,
[297.53s -> 311.88s]  in other ways too. I'm sure a lot of you did. Just name him The Wall. No, what? Aimless Dickhead.
[316.97s -> 324.23s]  How about, no, I'm not going to name him another meme. That's not how it works.
[325.11s -> 339.08s]  Somebody said, oh my god, I have homework to do. No, that's not funny.
[353.16s -> 365.24s]  Do I really have to name this character homework? How about homework? I'm not going
[365.24s -> 378.42s]  to name him be homework Simpson. No, no, no. How about, all right, I got one. I got one. This
[378.42s -> 390.60s]  is going to be it. No matter what it is, I don't care if I don't like it. How about that? That's
[390.60s -> 417.75s]  the best kind of good. The hiccups. I hate it. Don't you hate it when you get fucking hiccups
[417.75s -> 432.22s]  when you're doing your homework? Okay, this is important. Class. I need a shitload of endurance.
[432.94s -> 442.73s]  Who has the highest endurance base? It's the warrior. Warrior has the highest base endurance.
[447.03s -> 464.50s]  Why the? I mean, I guess I could. Deprived. This is first person mode, guys. So, no, no,
[464.50s -> 471.70s]  it's, wait, I haven't played Dark Souls 3 in a while. Is it, is, is Vigor weight or is
[471.70s -> 475.94s]  endurance weight? They all put weight up, don't they? Oh, no, that's resist, that's
[475.94s -> 492.02s]  resistance. Vigor is health. So just, I'm going to do, okay, that's not a bad idea. Do this and
[492.02s -> 504.17s]  just dump every point into endurance strength and HP. Vitality is weight. Oh, right, right. Okay,
[504.17s -> 524.86s]  okay, okay. Well, there we go. Knight. It's definitely going to be knight. Just making an
[524.86s -> 531.13s]  FPS. Knight's probably the best pick. I mean, yes, I understand. This is like what everybody
[531.13s -> 535.05s]  does. I didn't pick this when I first played, but I'm playing, I'm doing something very
[535.05s -> 542.78s]  specific. We're doing knight. He already starts with heavy armor. He's going to shield already.
[542.78s -> 552.62s]  Guys, I might not even make it past the third enemy of the game. All right, we're going to go
[552.62s -> 572.42s]  with, what do we want here? Probably the life ring. Appearance. This doesn't matter. Okay,
[573.90s -> 592.76s]  that's fine. Everyone's doing the resident sleeper for knight. Okay, but look at all
[592.76s -> 600.44s]  that vitality. It's got to be knight. Look, I don't have to be the actual knight,
[600.44s -> 612.20s]  but I need a shield right now. Let's go. Now, this might take a little bit of tweaking
[612.84s -> 621.53s]  because I tried to make it correct. We're going to see how bad this looks. Is this
[621.53s -> 637.05s]  your first Dark Souls? This is my first ever playthrough of Dark Souls. Already off the
[637.05s -> 647.32s]  bat, I feel more comfortable because I have shield. Nice arms. Dude, it's like a VR game.
[647.32s -> 655.69s]  Come on. This is going to be so hard. I could already tell. Roll. Ooh, you actually can dodge
[655.69s -> 665.08s]  roll. I'm not going to use it though because how the fuck am I going to dodge roll? I don't
[665.08s -> 671.24s]  even know. I, where, okay, first enemy. Can I, can you lock on? Oh, you can't lock on. I
[671.24s -> 680.39s]  don't know what direction I'm facing. This is going to be so terrifying. All right, we're
[680.39s -> 687.62s]  going to go this way. Easy. Yeah, as you say that now, but I can't lock on to enemies.
[687.62s -> 700.33s]  I'm going to have to play the whole game without locking on. Well, first item. Yeah,
[700.33s -> 709.51s]  this is actually really, really fucking cool. This changes the whole game. It's a controller
[709.51s -> 721.75s]  for an FP. I forgot about that guy. Oh, what? Oh my God. Parry or bad. Just let me take in
[721.75s -> 737.64s]  the world for a second. This is my first time ever playing Dark Souls. Parry or bad.
[737.64s -> 744.87s]  It's so different seeing it from this angle. Oh my God. It's so hard. I can't do it.
[747.88s -> 760.57s]  No, don't die at the fucking tutorial enemy. Seeing it from a different perspective.
[761.13s -> 764.89s]  This changes everything. I'm not, I'm going to have to relearn how to play the whole game.
[771.30s -> 775.85s]  Space is an issue too because I don't have to get that close. I'm getting way too close
[775.85s -> 787.74s]  than I need to. Did I miss any items? I think so. There's people over here. Let me see the
[787.74s -> 806.42s]  space, the distance here. Look at that. Oh my God. Got it. Control, wait, yeah, I can't use
[806.42s -> 810.82s]  the mouse. Don't you, you know what I mean? There is no mouse control. I have to be, it's
[810.82s -> 817.21s]  got to be console FPS for the very specific reason that the mouse does not do the thing that
[817.77s -> 827.67s]  you want it to do. The motion blur is fucking my mind. Hold on. Wait, is that,
[827.67s -> 842.22s]  is that an option I can turn off? All right, I'm going to turn it off. Motion blur off.
[844.70s -> 854.95s]  That's better. Turn depth of field off too. Yeah, that's true because it doesn't matter
[855.67s -> 863.99s]  because depth of field. Yeah, that's true. Depth of field off. Motion blur off.
[865.22s -> 876.90s]  Water surface quality high. Yeah, that's much better. This is what I want Skyrim to be is
[876.90s -> 891.54s]  this. The fucking view. Turn RTX on. I don't even, I don't want to sprint. I feel like
[891.54s -> 895.38s]  I'm going to have to play through this whole thing with whatever we do tonight. Not sprinting.
[898.25s -> 912.28s]  Can you turn arms on in the settings? There is an option to toggle like wrists, toggle hands,
[912.28s -> 918.84s]  toggle shield, but I like it like this because it gives space to my character.
[919.88s -> 927.70s]  You can turn off all these things, but I need them on. Yeah, you can toggle off the wrists,
[927.70s -> 930.98s]  but I like it. I like how it looks. It reminds me of like I'm actually playing
[930.98s -> 953.58s]  a first person game. This is trying to parry. What? What's happening? Oh, I know it's happening.
[954.30s -> 960.02s]  I know it's happening because I need to be facing a very specific direction
[960.74s -> 969.03s]  because if I try to parry a guy that's, okay, so if I'm standing like this,
[969.83s -> 973.59s]  the parry is going to work this way, right? But if I take a look at an enemy over here,
[974.39s -> 979.22s]  no, no, that's not going to work. You have to be straight in front of somebody.
[979.94s -> 986.30s]  Tweet that the stream is live? Oh, fuck, hold on. Yeah, just look at fucking Anor Londo over there.
[986.30s -> 1001.59s]  Is rolling in first person vomit inducing? It is not because it does not move your head.
[1001.59s -> 1013.94s]  The camera doesn't move. I'm going to just like tweet that. I'll be surprised if I could
[1013.94s -> 1029.99s]  beat the first boss here. It's going to take like an hour. We're going to do it. All right,
[1029.99s -> 1042.02s]  let's go. Now that looks ugly. That looks so cool, but the shield really is ruining it.
[1042.74s -> 1057.91s]  Oh, man. Oh, it's, it's, it is so hard to parry in first person. You just, it's like nothing
[1057.91s -> 1068.58s]  you've ever seen before. No, I have to learn. I have to learn how to do it.
[1073.88s -> 1093.46s]  I'm not even facing the right direction. Use of mouse. That doesn't, the mouse isn't going to
[1093.46s -> 1103.21s]  do. Oh my God. Wait a minute. Is it? No, I can't use the mouse. See? No, that's hell.
[1103.21s -> 1115.69s]  That looks horrible. All right, forget about parrying for now. Let's just move on. I'll
[1115.69s -> 1128.90s]  learn it eventually. I love and hate this at the same time. I love this more than I hate this stuff,
[1128.90s -> 1139.24s]  so that it's good. I like it. It's actually really fucking cool. All right, I remember this
[1139.24s -> 1150.86s]  part. I gotta jump to this. Oh my goodness. I didn't make it. Yeah, get out of my way.
[1151.58s -> 1158.17s]  Yeah, locking on doesn't do very much either.
[1159.93s -> 1166.60s]  Because once you lock on, if you step in a certain direction, it doesn't lock on anymore.
[1166.60s -> 1181.69s]  Let me go get that item. Beat the boss first try. I'm going to go for it. I can't
[1181.69s -> 1202.74s]  promise it's going to happen, but I'm going to, I'm going to try. Oh God damn it. Attempt number
[1202.74s -> 1217.53s]  three to jump, to jump to item. Okay, I got it. Get my first shot. All right, let's go,
[1217.53s -> 1249.42s]  Gundyr. I am prepared, but not really at all. It's scary like this. Do I have to be a
[1249.42s -> 1263.91s]  role player? So I cast up the sword from your chest. Champion of Gundyr. Oh my goodness,
[1263.91s -> 1306.41s]  gracious. It's mind blowing. This is insane. I don't even know where I am. If I get him to
[1306.41s -> 1325.14s]  phase two, I'll be happy. Oh, I just can't tell where I am. Maybe I should just bring
[1325.14s -> 1353.30s]  his shield out. Oh fuck. Oh my God. He turns into an alien. Oh, it was a decent first
[1353.30s -> 1362.12s]  attempt. Died to Gundyr. Yeah, I did. And I'm proud of it. Let me try the shield this time.
[1362.92s -> 1369.21s]  That's how I was going to do it before. I'm going to try shield. Let's try blocking and
[1369.21s -> 1380.94s]  dodging because dodging is going to be very hard. I'm just going to hold my hand in the
[1380.94s -> 1397.74s]  air like this. All right, let's go. What's wrong with his body? What happened? Why does
[1397.74s -> 1425.82s]  he have an extra limb? He gained a limb. Oh, I'm facing the wrong way. Okay, now I am.
[1426.62s -> 1469.82s]  Oh, not this shit. This is so scary. This is worse than a horror game. I swear to God.
[1470.78s -> 1496.97s]  Jesus. Oh my God. This is worse than anything. Oh my God. This is too scary. Nice YouTuber
[1496.97s -> 1513.21s]  reaction. I'll get it. I'll get it. I got it. I got it. I got it. This is the coolest
[1513.21s -> 1517.90s]  mod ever. You know why? Because it doesn't matter how many times you've played this game.
[1519.10s -> 1528.42s]  This is probably character number like 15 for me. It doesn't matter. Something ain't
[1528.50s -> 1533.91s]  right here. Something ain't right. He's still like the puppet thing.
[1544.22s -> 1552.49s]  Okay, I guess we're going to deal with it. What happens when he turns on his puppet
[1552.49s -> 1577.51s]  master thing? I can see him attack now. This is not good. The assets aren't resetting when
[1577.51s -> 1585.94s]  he dies. Oh, that's not good. You almost have to go by audio cues for a lot of these things.
[1586.66s -> 1693.00s]  Oh, there we go. Okay. Oh shit. Oh my God. Oh, don't do it. Don't do it. Oh, that's intense.
[1694.38s -> 1710.44s]  I like this. Yeah, we got to think about weapon. What the hell I want to use for a weapon.
[1714.47s -> 1720.86s]  You're going to hate it in an hour or so. Oh, I'm aware. This is going to be fun for like
[1720.86s -> 1738.47s]  an hour. Use a face cam. I can't put a face cam on. Dual wield ultra greatswords or riot.
[1741.43s -> 1754.86s]  I need something that's got good. I don't know. Reach. All right. Can somebody count
[1754.86s -> 1779.83s]  the YouTuber screams that I make over the course of the stream? I need depth. A homeward
[1779.83s -> 1787.62s]  bone. Here comes the fall off joke. No, no, no. That's going to happen, but not right now.
[1788.58s -> 1797.46s]  Face cam or ice cream. You're going to have to eat ice cream. I'm sorry.
[1798.18s -> 1804.81s]  Yeah. Here's a fall off joke for you. Everybody does this to this guy.
[1807.14s -> 1821.91s]  Yeah. Now the shot just, can I think? No, no way. I'm going to fight that guy up there.
[1822.71s -> 1838.39s]  Get a Katana. I can't go that way. Fight the Katana guy. I have to parry the Katana guy.
[1838.39s -> 1843.83s]  And we've seen how disastrous that is. I need to let me, I got to level up first.
[1856.04s -> 1868.68s]  I almost just killed her. Everybody knows this. All right. What the hell do I want to do? How
[1868.68s -> 1876.57s]  am I going to play this? Just dump it into endurance at first. Or should I just dump it
[1876.57s -> 1896.78s]  into vitality? Dex. Yeah. Dex is probably a good idea. Cause I could use a bow, but the bow
[1896.78s -> 1913.14s]  doesn't bow go into first person anyways. Luck. There's no reason to do luck unless I want to
[1913.14s -> 1923.56s]  get a specific scaling item or. Well, we definitely need, our endurance is terrible right now. So
[1923.56s -> 1947.38s]  let me just get this out of the way. Okay. You really get to see the scale of how the
[1947.38s -> 1955.86s]  game actually is. This hallway seems so far away. The blacksmith is so far away. When you play this
[1955.86s -> 1961.56s]  game from the normal perspective, it's just like, oh, there he is. How you doing? This is a long
[1961.56s -> 1978.94s]  walk. All right. Let me go try to embarrass myself at the Katana guy. The shield is so
[1978.94s -> 1985.34s]  annoying. I know, but the shield might become very necessary as in like right now.
[1987.93s -> 1994.02s]  No, he's, I can't do anything with him, right? I got to get the soul thing from the tree.
[1995.22s -> 2003.77s]  It really makes it feel like Dark Souls.
[2014.07s -> 2031.91s]  All right. Let's go try to lose to the Katana guy. Just dump it into endurance. And I'm
[2031.91s -> 2035.83s]  going to just do like a raw gem. Somebody mentioned that. That's a good idea. All right.
[2035.83s -> 2069.35s]  Where is he? Come on. Parry first try. One, two, three. I just like let him kill me. All right.
[2069.91s -> 2078.60s]  All right. Back to it. Oh wait. That's right. I can't do it now. I locked myself out for a
[2078.60s -> 2105.29s]  little while, didn't I? Come on, load. I'm going to get this sword. Welcome to the next
[2105.29s -> 2108.73s]  Farby. At least five minutes of the spring because that's all it's going to take me.
[2120.92s -> 2121.80s]  Off the stairs. Come on.
[2127.80s -> 2154.26s]  I wasn't ready for that one. Oh shit. That's all off now. I don't even know where I am.
[2154.26s -> 2163.66s]  I can't parry somebody on a staircase. Get these people out of the way.
[2169.24s -> 2173.56s]  You dickhead. I'm going to lose again. No, I just get the people on the stairs.
[2183.06s -> 2186.50s]  This is like the bodies on the stairs in first person. It's so much worse.
[2189.82s -> 2199.80s]  I would have had it too if I didn't because they take up so much more real estate on your
[2199.80s -> 2213.70s]  screen when you're at this perspective. Get me in there. I'm doing it. He needed one hit too.
[2213.70s -> 2222.28s]  Fucking god. Increase the FOV. I don't know if it's possible. I might throw up if I do
[2223.99s -> 2227.83s]  because this is already at... I think this is already at something very high.
[2234.55s -> 2237.67s]  All right. Just don't move. Just do what I just did. I just did it like four times
[2237.67s -> 2249.56s]  in a row. I just panicked because he did a quick swing. What was wrong with that?
[2250.20s -> 2270.68s]  He's still hitting me. I gotta heal. Fucker. I didn't even know how close he was.
[2272.06s -> 2290.46s]  I think there's a wall behind me. Wait. Hold on. I'll get him. Get the fuck out of my way.
[2342.81s -> 2344.33s]  I don't think I've ever seen what that guy looks like.
[2344.33s -> 2361.08s]  All right. I'm gonna do this one more time. Last try. Last try and this time I'm gonna...
[2361.08s -> 2390.71s]  I'm just gonna fight him the old-fashioned way. Parrys are weird. Let's go. Oh never mind.
[2390.71s -> 2401.11s]  That's too hard. Need to control this camera with right stick. Oh no way.
[2423.19s -> 2454.09s]  How's he still alive? Oh okay. Why don't we exit the game. Modern problems require
[2454.09s -> 2467.35s]  modern solution. Okay. I get this rest of the bonfire, right? Did I miss any other items?
[2467.35s -> 2473.86s]  I know there's like a dog down here, right? There's like a place to get. Yeah. Right here.
[2474.50s -> 2478.98s]  Is there an item? Oh fuck it. Who cares? I've already played this game like a thousand times.
[2479.86s -> 2496.74s]  So I... resting at the bonfire will do the same thing, won't it? I actually need to like
[2496.74s -> 2515.27s]  quit the game. Gotta reload. Okay. Bonfire. Bonfire. Bonfire. Chat. Bonfire will work.
[2516.23s -> 2544.52s]  Let's see. Yeah. It's right there. All right. So do I... do I put this on? Is the question.
[2545.32s -> 2568.10s]  Dark Souls 1 is the... is where you have to reload. Yeah. All right. Let's move on.
[2568.66s -> 2572.95s]  I have enough to level up. I'm gonna do endurance again. Or maybe vitality.
[2579.88s -> 2582.95s]  What do I need here? Yeah.
[2590.42s -> 2593.13s]  All right. It's time to... let me see what that looks like.
[2593.13s -> 2602.95s]  I played with this. You need 16. 115. I can't even... can I... I can't even two-handed or anything, right?
[2604.15s -> 2618.15s]  I can. Let's... this is... I think... I got the master's armor, right?
[2622.10s -> 2625.30s]  No. I don't want this shit on. I need the defense.
[2629.90s -> 2633.10s]  Two-handed dex weapon. What? You two-hand the katana. What's wrong with that?
[2633.90s -> 2653.38s]  All right. I'm going. Lego island confirmed. What do you mean Lego island confirmed?
[2655.22s -> 2662.22s]  This is not a YouTuber... this is not a YouTuber setup. I mean, yes, it is probably. They always
[2662.22s -> 2670.49s]  probably pick night, don't they? See, this is the part I'm interested in here. I want to see how
[2670.49s -> 2675.30s]  this looks from first person. It's gonna be so cool. Remember when you first looked at this?
[2675.30s -> 2696.07s]  When you first played this game two years ago? That's so cool. Even the boxes look better.
[2696.79s -> 2711.13s]  I don't want to rush through this. It's too interesting to just run by the bonfire and
[2711.13s -> 2728.60s]  go. It's a pretty good E3 demo you're doing. E3 presentation camera. So?
[2732.60s -> 2739.45s]  At the high wall of Lothric, your character will start their journey. But be careful.
[2739.45s -> 2748.57s]  Dragons and ghouls are amount. Each character in Dark Souls 3 is unique.
[2750.17s -> 2772.01s]  Fuck. That happens in the presentation. Fired. Oh no, that guy. I gotta kill that guy.
[2772.65s -> 2784.49s]  This is what the shield is for. I'm gonna have... I'm gonna shit my pants during the stream.
[2785.05s -> 2798.36s]  I think this is the correct way to do it. I need a big shield and I'm gonna be heavy.
[2799.50s -> 2838.62s]  It's too scary to dodge around. No, let's go up here first. Oh god. The default enemies
[2839.67s -> 2855.40s]  are even terrifying. Jesus. I don't even know. My back is against the wall.
[2855.40s -> 2888.55s]  Fuck. How fast do I run? I gotta keep going. Just progression. Progress up to where that
[2888.55s -> 2919.62s]  guy's throwing from. Chat. No, chat. What's going on with chat? What is this? Dermot turns
[2919.62s -> 2929.53s]  his webcam on. Dermot turns it on blinking. His eyes begin to slowly wrap into the
[2929.53s -> 2941.45s]  Dark Souls audio in the background against the increasing volume. Why is that going on
[2941.45s -> 2952.73s]  right now? What does that have to do with anything? Three hits for everyone. Longsword.
[2953.29s -> 2980.81s]  This one's new so it's better. Got the binoculars. I'm gonna get lost. I used to
[2980.81s -> 2992.65s]  know this area like the back of my hand. Not anymore. Use them? Ah. Let's use them.
[2992.65s -> 3017.45s]  What are we gonna look at? Up there? That's it. All that's left is remove my shield and
[3017.45s -> 3029.03s]  sword. The only thing I don't like about the visuals is the beige. It is a little
[3029.03s -> 3034.66s]  dreary here, but we're not supposed to be seeing it from this perspective. This is not
[3034.66s -> 3042.49s]  allowed. You're supposed to be up above, up like there, in like a third person
[3042.49s -> 3063.56s]  perspective. It is very interesting to go through this all again though. So, locking on.
[3065.96s -> 3070.73s]  I wonder if locking on... Wow. My brain just can't do it from here.
[3072.97s -> 3084.47s]  It's never gonna happen. It's just too awkward. I did it like perfectly fine,
[3084.47s -> 3088.54s]  like four times in a row, but no, I ain't gonna have them reliably.
[3089.18s -> 3094.31s]  All right, now that I explored that area, I'm gonna go refill my life.
[3115.13s -> 3119.85s]  2018 Jerma is better than 2019 Jerma? We've had like two weeks!
[3124.54s -> 3129.42s]  That's such an unfair statement. You have a full year of streams that you can remember.
[3130.14s -> 3166.62s]  It's been two weeks! Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna die. Okay, here we go. It's easier
[3166.62s -> 3175.88s]  to be surrounded by enemies. I'll be lucky enough if I get to, uh, the big bulldog.
[3175.88s -> 3193.83s]  Where his name is. Bulldog of the boreal valley. Bort? What's his name? This is,
[3193.83s -> 3196.39s]  this is what I waited for the whole time. This is what I wanted to see.
[3197.11s -> 3199.86s]  Get out of the way. You're gonna ruin the fucking shot. Get out of my way.
[3201.08s -> 3206.95s]  You're gonna ruin the shot! Get out of the way! You don't ruin the shot.
[3207.67s -> 3218.23s]  Here it comes, here it comes. Where is it? Where's the dragon?
[3221.10s -> 3253.99s]  I'm not gonna go up. E3 scripted moment. That's just level.
[3255.61s -> 3279.16s]  Ow. No, I forgot about these guys. Get those arrows out. Oh. How do I take the arrow out?
[3279.16s -> 3285.03s]  Do they just, it's just in my chest. I'm gonna lose to these guys. This is gonna be bad.
[3286.42s -> 3318.34s]  Ohhhhh. I'm gonna get surrounded here. They like, crawl up. Yeah, they crawl up, right?
[3319.86s -> 3328.70s]  How did I miss every one of those? How's that possible?
[3329.66s -> 3337.14s]  I swung in every single direction. So we gotta go through here. I remember this part.
[3341.59s -> 3343.51s]  Don't call me a game journalist.
[3357.02s -> 3371.74s]  And who cares? I really should just retitle this stream. Dark Souls,
[3371.74s -> 3392.04s]  Dark Souls 3. The E3 experience. That's not a bad idea. Oh, a bonfire! Good find.
[3401.03s -> 3403.99s]  Open the mimic so we can see the first person. I'm not reading that.
[3404.87s -> 3409.02s]  You're gonna have to find somebody else to read that one. It ain't gonna be me.
[3409.66s -> 3421.77s]  It's funny because when I first installed this and I thought, hey, this would be,
[3421.77s -> 3427.29s]  so this would be fun to do for a little bit. I actually did not think I would get to this point.
[3429.67s -> 3436.28s]  So we're gonna beat, uh, Bort of the, of the Boreal Battlet. We're gonna beat that dog.
[3437.58s -> 3445.40s]  I'm gonna beat that boss. What's down here? I forget.
[3449.34s -> 3451.58s]  I tell you, isn't there like little, like, jester guys down here too?
[3455.86s -> 3467.99s]  There are. There is. No? It's so cool that you can actually see where they're
[3467.99s -> 3474.94s]  placing the enemies. It makes it harder, but it also makes it easier in some rooms.
[3475.58s -> 3494.31s]  Yeah, that's undead settlement. Yeah. Wrong place. What do I hear noises?
[3495.43s -> 3504.15s]  Can I want to try this with a bow? That would be interesting, but
[3504.15s -> 3506.31s]  when you go to bow, you go to first person anyways, don't you?
[3507.83s -> 3512.70s]  Although I guess it would be, maybe we should just see what it looks like.
[3517.10s -> 3524.06s]  How bad do these people smell? Oh, I get it. Okay. First person. For a second,
[3524.06s -> 3531.45s]  I'm like, what are you talking about? I remember this part. Okay. All right,
[3531.45s -> 3536.57s]  all right, all right, all right. I got to kill the guy right in the middle.
[3539.48s -> 3543.35s]  Go get him. Which one is it? Which one is he? This one right here.
[3549.56s -> 3579.53s]  I didn't do it fast enough. Oh, no, no, no way. No way. Not gonna happen. No way.
[3581.29s -> 3594.10s]  No way. Where's, how about, okay, there's a wall. Go, go, go, go, go.
[3594.10s -> 3602.47s]  I didn't do it fast enough. Shit. Oh well.
[3628.70s -> 3634.23s]  Does he come over here? This is not a, this is not a coward move. Okay.
[3634.95s -> 3652.23s]  This is intelligence at its finest. I ain't gonna fight that guy like that.
[3652.23s -> 3654.95s]  And for these guys, those guys attack every quarter of a second.
[3655.67s -> 3666.92s]  I would get eaten alive. Wait, I can hear it. Is it weird that my other senses are better
[3666.92s -> 3669.40s]  in first person? I can hear that cookie bug from a mile away here.
[3671.19s -> 3675.40s]  I can hear better. It's making my other senses.
[3679.22s -> 3702.74s]  Told you. Look. Cookie bug is the raw gem. That's all I need. That's so cool.
[3703.46s -> 3715.91s]  I am gonna stop and look at all that every time. You know how sometimes you ask yourself
[3715.91s -> 3718.79s]  when you fall from a height in Dark Souls? I know I wasn't even that far.
[3719.67s -> 3724.02s]  I could survive that. No, you couldn't. Looking at this now from this perspective?
[3724.02s -> 3733.05s]  No way. You're dead instantly. Now I, I need to get this shortcut, which is down here.
[3733.77s -> 3742.71s]  There's also, oh shit. Didn't they have the spear in there?
[3743.51s -> 3748.26s]  Forget about items and shit. I need to just get a shortcut.
[3755.14s -> 3781.99s]  Yeah, they come from behind too, don't they? Coward journalist.
[3782.71s -> 3787.37s]  Is this a new character that you, that we're making up here, that you guys are making up?
[3787.93s -> 3814.70s]  Okay. I think it might be time for a weapon switch because the,
[3814.70s -> 3816.70s]  there's a chance that this guy drops the halberd, right?
[3817.58s -> 3824.22s]  Or do I just run by this guy and say fuck it and don't even try?
[3824.94s -> 3849.75s]  It's down here, right? There's something, there's a weapon here. What is it? No.
[3851.19s -> 3861.90s]  Does he see me? Will he see me if I sit here? What the fuck was that noise?
[3863.38s -> 3892.68s]  What? Oh, it was just a scripted event. Anything else I can,
[3892.68s -> 3895.32s]  I don't think I should fight this guy right now. He's going to kick the shit out of me.
[3904.86s -> 3908.22s]  Just bury him. That's way easier said than done.
[3908.86s -> 3918.68s]  Ember. Anything else? Yeah, I'm getting the shortcut.
[3919.69s -> 3922.97s]  No way in hell am I going to get my ass kicked right here. I have to get the shortcut
[3922.97s -> 3934.22s]  first. If I would have died there, I would have been very sad. Yeah, I got the,
[3934.22s -> 3948.15s]  I got the weapon. But I, honestly, this is just horror Skyrim. This is just,
[3948.15s -> 3973.77s]  this is Skyrim with consequences. Okay, we're good.
[3973.77s -> 3992.55s]  The gaming journalist nearly has a heart attack playing New Souls game.
[4001.58s -> 4012.62s]  You get swarmed here. Get on the elevator.
[4019.74s -> 4024.30s]  These near death elevator moments are going to be fucking scary.
[4030.17s -> 4043.21s]  There it is. All right, we're good. Oh shit, I'm out of stamina.
[4045.78s -> 4051.22s]  What? How did you do that? What's happening to me?
[4054.07s -> 4085.29s]  Get behind, right? Roll into a backstab. Oh, I'm freaking out. I'm panicking.
[4085.85s -> 4109.22s]  Do I live next to an airport? All right, we did it. We got the shortcut.
[4109.94s -> 4129.91s]  Now we just have to kill the boss. All right, so I can level up.
[4130.47s -> 4136.39s]  This is decision time though. This really matters. Choices, my choices actually matter
[4136.39s -> 4142.74s]  right now. For real. Because I don't know what's going to be more effective in first person.
[4146.46s -> 4159.13s]  Long reach, heavy, quick, and able to move. A spear, a spear would work. Use the broken sword.
[4159.85s -> 4174.82s]  That would be so stupid. I would also probably, I would say spear as well.
[4175.54s -> 4183.19s]  Why would I use the broken? This is not one of those challenge games
[4183.83s -> 4187.83s]  where I need to use no weapons or not get hit or something. Those, that,
[4189.27s -> 4193.27s]  respect to the people that do that and play that. It can do that.
[4193.27s -> 4206.94s]  I ain't gonna two-handed broken sword this game. No, what am I doing? I have to level up.
[4206.94s -> 4214.33s]  I don't know what to do. There's so many options. I mean, I could just raw gem a long
[4214.33s -> 4237.22s]  sword. Let me just open the, let's break these all. Maybe I will try just, in quotes, spear.
[4243.75s -> 4247.83s]  Long sword with raw gem is 136. It's really not that big of a deal.
[4249.03s -> 4270.94s]  You don't have a spear, do you? I mean, that's a halberd, but that's not necessarily a spear.
[4271.82s -> 4296.12s]  I mean, it is. 1500, I need 16 strength. The halberd is dog shit. All right. It really,
[4296.12s -> 4309.22s]  I, I know, but I need the reach. I'm going to use the halberd.
[4310.04s -> 4323.16s]  We're gonna, we're gonna think outside the fucking box. But first, two-handing a long
[4323.16s -> 4328.25s]  sword has the reach that you need. It's probably gonna have to do strength.
[4329.29s -> 4334.09s]  What is a spear? A spear's decks are strong. They're like a combination of both, aren't they?
[4334.09s -> 4338.57s]  Aren't most of the spears in the game have a base dexterity you need of at least like 15 to
[4338.57s -> 4350.62s]  20? So then I should probably be putting points into dexterity. Why is she just talking in the
[4350.62s -> 4360.71s]  background? I know I do. I don't understand. Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going for spears.
[4361.75s -> 4367.11s]  So we're going to do decks. I don't want to do a halberd.
[4372.36s -> 4375.08s]  You also talk in the background. Yeah, that's true. I do.
[4378.87s -> 4389.53s]  She, she can't tell that I left. The fire keeper is streaming right now. Yeah. She's
[4389.53s -> 4400.07s]  streaming just chatting. All right. I'm going for it. 14 decks. I need at least like 20,
[4400.07s -> 4424.09s]  or like 18 for a lot of the spears. Plus two reading off chat. I guess I could probably
[4424.09s -> 4441.59s]  do it a couple more times. Just break them all. Just give me one more point, right?
[4442.39s -> 4452.46s]  Put it into like endurance. Yeah, put it in health.
[4457.48s -> 4461.40s]  Okay, and no, let's just try to kill the boss.
[4461.80s -> 4477.98s]  This is Jeremy's first time playing Dark Souls, so don't forget to type in all your helpful tips.
[4479.18s -> 4498.90s]  Up the FOV. I can't. We're currently at over a hundred, I believe. Let me just see exactly
[4498.90s -> 4519.72s]  what FOV we are right now. FOV is at, I don't know if I can change it. No, I'm not sure
[4519.72s -> 4531.72s]  I can change this. It might crash the game if I try to change it. Because if the FOV
[4531.72s -> 4542.09s]  has changed any more than it is now, you'll probably be able to see by the end of the
[4543.75s -> 4551.74s]  yeah, behind me. It'll fuck up the whole thing. All right, let's go. So I got the
[4551.74s -> 4559.56s]  shortcut. I have to go down from here, right? I'm so fucking, I am so
[4560.76s -> 4592.79s]  de-sotarente, you know what I mean? There it is. That's so scary. No. What's going on?
[4594.79s -> 4642.49s]  Oh my fucking god. Why is this on? 10, 22. I mean, let's put it on.
[4642.89s -> 4668.04s]  What the fuck did I just do? What's going on? There we go. Now we just got good. Now we got
[4668.04s -> 4696.14s]  real good. I can poke from behind the shield. I love it. It's perfect. Don't get overzealous
[4696.14s -> 4706.81s]  with yourself. I've already used two flasks. All right, now let's fight the dragon. And by
[4706.81s -> 4741.13s]  dragon, I mean the dragon rider, the dragon slayer, this guy. I don't even know what
[4741.21s -> 4770.47s]  mode I'm in right now. Am I in? I blame that on the broken sword bullshit. It's okay. Pro tip,
[4770.47s -> 4776.18s]  don't panic and run past the spinning death axe. Well, it's easier said than done.
[4777.38s -> 4799.34s]  That's easier said than done. Oh, it's not up here. Oh, no. I have to do this.
[4799.98s -> 4840.20s]  Where is he? Okay, he's dead. Oh, I don't have it behind me enough. Wait, there's a weapon
[4841.00s -> 4880.07s]  over here. There's a spear over here. There's a spear somewhere over here. Let me get it
[4880.71s -> 4887.83s]  because that would help. I'm gonna have to just run, get the item, and then run to the
[4887.83s -> 4916.79s]  boss. It's up there, right? The high tower of Lothric. There it is. I'm trapped. I'm trapped.
[4916.79s -> 4935.10s]  I gotta run. How much is it to wear this? I need 15 strength. I could two-hand it, but
[4935.26s -> 4949.06s]  I lose the shield. Let's take a look. Hold on. This just looks like Grandpa's cane.
[4950.84s -> 4978.46s]  I'm gonna give it a try. How many times can I spin? I need to take the shield off because
[4978.46s -> 4993.98s]  it's gonna get in the way. All right, here we go. What's cousin it? No, what's the hand?
[4993.98s -> 5003.50s]  What's the hand from Adam's family? The thing. No, not the thing. No, it's not master
[5003.50s -> 5020.30s]  hand. Mr. Hands. No, cousin hands. See if I can first strike. This is the first real test.
[5025.08s -> 5033.37s]  This is incredibly medicine. Can I do it? He's getting closer. He's getting closer. Hold on.
[5033.37s -> 5047.24s]  I got it. Whoa! Okay, no, he does like a dash, right? Yeah, he does the dash.
[5072.36s -> 5094.98s]  I need to heal. Shit. Bad, bad, bad, very bad. It was right in front of me.
[5095.78s -> 5127.75s]  Oh, I'm stuck inside of his body. Where is he? Oh, no, no, no, no. This is where he dashes.
[5136.65s -> 5141.88s]  He breathes ice. He breathes ice. Run! I have to go to the left side, but it didn't happen.
[5152.50s -> 5197.30s]  It's wild. This is absolutely wild. Oh, shit. What have I done?
[5214.65s -> 5237.53s]  Whoa! I'm so scared. Itchy nose. Itchy fucking nose right now. Itchy nose. I have to itch it.
[5249.58s -> 5267.72s]  Die, die, die, die, die, die! Got it. Oh, itchy. Thank God. That was bad. It got really,
[5267.72s -> 5274.39s]  really itchy. That was like fighting him for the first time again. And although I
[5274.39s -> 5295.46s]  obviously remember the moves he does, but. Oh, we had a raid coming? Raid. I don't see who
[5295.46s -> 5316.18s]  it was. Now fight the dancer. This is so cool. Oh, it was a joke raid. It wasn't a real raid. It
[5316.18s -> 5325.85s]  was a joke raid. I gotta get the banner. No, it was real. Who raided? Why are you guys telling
[5325.85s -> 5343.30s]  me it wasn't real? Oh, everyone's saying it was not real. From Katie. Well, thank you, Katie.
[5343.30s -> 5347.86s]  Welcome. I thought it was fake. Everyone told me that it was fake. I'm sorry to call you
[5347.86s -> 5353.72s]  fake. We've had fake raids before. People, there are characters in this universe.
[5356.17s -> 5369.98s]  But thank you so much. Welcome, everybody. Hopefully you had a good stream. Really
[5369.98s -> 5378.12s]  appreciate it. Thank you. Welcome to Dark Souls First Person. It's a pretty fun fucking game.
[5379.08s -> 5385.02s]  That was a pretty good YouTuber intro. God, I gotta welcome the new viewers, man.
[5385.82s -> 5391.14s]  Hey, what's going on, guys? Welcome to the stream. Just had a WTF moment there.
[5391.86s -> 5407.48s]  I beat Bort first try. Yeah, I'm leaving. Oh, damn it. I'm sorry. Do you think I can fight the
[5407.48s -> 5423.08s]  legendary holy man over there? Can't do two. I cannot do two. I can do one. Definitely not
[5423.08s -> 5438.22s]  two at a time. I'm trying to get a backstab. Sometimes you gotta run, and that's right now.
[5438.22s -> 5460.07s]  I just want to get the item. I can do a GTA rear view mirror. Oh, fuck off. Ah,
[5460.07s -> 5467.43s]  the wait has been long. I am Emma, priestess. You will not find the Lords of Cinder here. They
[5467.43s -> 5473.83s]  have left to their journey homes converging at the base of this castle. Quick, say something
[5473.83s -> 5480.79s]  funny before they leave. I don't got anything funny. I have nothing funny to say right now.
[5484.12s -> 5487.16s]  I don't know. What's something funny that I could say to keep them here?
[5488.12s -> 5492.66s]  Kill her. Why would I do that? That's not funny. That just ruins the game.
[5493.54s -> 5499.43s]  That ruins the video game. I'm not going to ruin the video game. I got the item and I'm going to
[5500.31s -> 5504.58s]  what's up here? This is a guy. He's guarding an item, right? No, he's not. He's just hard.
[5505.38s -> 5535.19s]  We're in desperate need of an LUL moment. Well, you're not getting any LUL moments because
[5535.99s -> 5541.16s]  the streamer is doing pretty good in the first person. LOL. No way he's going to be
[5541.16s -> 5546.42s]  able to beat anything in first person. LOL stream. I'm doing pretty good considering.
[5547.30s -> 5561.88s]  Hey, uh, wave, uh, bye bye. Hehehe. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot.
[5562.60s -> 5580.89s]  Hey guy, guys, put your hand up. Wave. Bye bye. Why is it a trunk impression?
[5597.42s -> 5616.14s]  Get the fuck away from me. Holy shit. Get away from me. They're still alive.
[5619.16s -> 5622.52s]  No, don't die here. Don't die. I'm right next to the fucking bonfire.
[5631.27s -> 5646.01s]  Oh, just travel there. I forgot. I played too much Dark Souls 1. I can actually,
[5646.01s -> 5659.26s]  I can just teleport to it. Does the targeting know? Targeting works, but it kind of breaks.
[5662.17s -> 5668.41s]  Targeting only works if they're in like a pretty much like a 60 degree cone in front of you
[5669.13s -> 5674.25s]  because it doesn't turn the camera to face the person. So if they're in this kind of area,
[5674.25s -> 5680.41s]  let's, I'll give you an example here. So this is point A. This is point B. Chair is
[5680.41s -> 5686.25s]  point B. If they're in this, that cone, right? That's a foul ball over there.
[5687.61s -> 5691.69s]  If I move this way, yeah, sure. If I move this way, yeah, sure.
[5691.69s -> 5708.01s]  But if I go like this, the camera does not keep turning. What's the, uh, what does frost dog
[5708.01s -> 5713.66s]  have for a boss soul weapon? It's like a, it's like an ice sword, right? The thing's a
[5713.66s -> 5720.07s]  piece of fucking shit. So I ain't gonna use it. I don't get the joke. That wasn't a joke.
[5720.07s -> 5729.42s]  I was giving, I was telling you how, how it is with targeting. I didn't get it until you put
[5729.42s -> 5742.66s]  it into baseball terms. See? The ice mace is good. Okay, but we're going spear. Welcome,
[5742.66s -> 5750.25s]  host. Very well, then taken. All right, what do I get endurance to 15? I don't have to
[5750.25s -> 5758.47s]  worry about it. Farewell, Ashen One. Okay, should I upgrade? I'm gonna just upgrade this
[5758.47s -> 5771.22s]  thing. Sorcery would be good because you can, uh, spacing doesn't matter. Depth doesn't matter.
[5771.22s -> 5780.90s]  Yeah, that's true. Uh, should I get this to, I mean, you get tight knight shards, or diamond
[5780.90s -> 5810.20s]  doesn't. So I'm just gonna upgrade it once. Or 56, 156 versus what would it be? 38. No,
[5810.20s -> 5823.08s]  it's not worth it. Just get an actual spear. I'm not going to kill anybody. I'm not killing
[5823.08s -> 5833.46s]  any NPCs. Let's do long sword quality build. I want to stab though. All right, so we're
[5833.46s -> 5849.94s]  gonna go back to theirs, put the banner down. I, there are other mods that I have, but
[5851.14s -> 5876.70s]  I kind of like this. This is fun. Should we try another one? The invisible van. He's naked.
[5877.34s -> 5885.56s]  All he has is two gloves on. Yeah, I have, uh, some other ones. Okay, here's the thing,
[5885.56s -> 5892.23s]  though. If I turn on the other ones, it will actually ruin the entire game. Now,
[5892.23s -> 5897.51s]  I'm going to get my fill of first person mod before I turn on the randomize the speed
[5897.51s -> 5914.46s]  of the game mod. Do you understand? No, I can't. Look, do you see how beautiful this is?
[5920.54s -> 5962.31s]  Do them both at the same time. I wouldn't get anything done. Wait a second. Hey,
[5962.31s -> 5967.51s]  what's going on guys? No, this is just a reaction to the reaction.
[5968.95s -> 5990.78s]  That was just a reaction. Hold on. Is there a voiceover on this one?
[5992.95s -> 5996.63s]  One is that we've incorporated kind of things that are going on around you in
[5996.63s -> 6000.47s]  the community into the world map itself. So it's a really natural.
[6005.59s -> 6009.59s]  Okay, let's go. When you and I were talking a little bit earlier, you were talking about
[6009.59s -> 6015.35s]  ways that a player who maybe doesn't have a big pool of friends online or, or isn't super
[6015.35s -> 6018.39s]  social when it comes to online gaming, how they can connect with other players in the
[6018.39s -> 6022.23s]  world in Anthem. Can you talk a little bit about how me, when I jump into Anthem,
[6022.23s -> 6025.03s]  when it comes out, how I'm going to find other players and how the game is going
[6025.03s -> 6030.55s]  to alert me that other things are happening? Sure. I love that. So we realized that sometimes
[6030.55s -> 6034.79s]  multiplayer experiences can be a little bit awkward or it might be kind of difficult
[6034.79s -> 6041.03s]  to find other friends to play with. So we've done a couple of things to try to ease that
[6041.03s -> 6046.23s]  experience out. One is that we've incorporated kind of things that are going on around you
[6046.23s -> 6053.54s]  in the community into the world map itself. So it's a really natural action. Open up
[6053.54s -> 6059.22s]  your world map. And on that world map, you're going to see what other people are doing
[6059.22s -> 6063.06s]  too. So if someone else is playing scars and villainy and you want to jump in and play
[6063.06s -> 6068.10s]  that mission to just right there on the map, click into it, join their game in progress
[6068.10s -> 6070.50s]  and have a great time. Nevermind.
[6076.36s -> 6089.54s]  This one's going to be good. I promise. Yeah, this is going to be good. Here we go.
[6091.30s -> 6097.38s]  Yeah, this is great. I got my own little TV. This is perfect. Adam's doing a fantastic job
[6097.38s -> 6101.54s]  so far. It's been really good. First of all, you're actually playing this right now.
[6102.18s -> 6107.38s]  I do want to emphasize how beautiful this game is. Oh, thank you. Brian, tell me
[6107.38s -> 6110.58s]  a little bit about what you guys want to show us this evening. So I think, I mean,
[6110.58s -> 6115.54s]  the big thing is, again, I think that part of the Spider-Man fantasy is to swing around
[6115.54s -> 6119.78s]  New York City and to have not only just a great story but have a bunch of different
[6119.78s -> 6125.14s]  activities in that world and we want to, you know, give people who attend E3 an
[6125.14s -> 6129.78s]  opportunity to experience that. So, you know, obviously we, it's a big narrative
[6129.78s -> 6133.86s]  driven experience, but same time, part of that superhero fantasy, especially that
[6133.86s -> 6139.46s]  Spider-Man experience is living within New York City and seeing that. So, you
[6139.46s -> 6144.42s]  know, Adam is one of, he's one of our combat pro players because he's a
[6144.42s -> 6151.00s]  combat designer and... That one wasn't very good. I was going to try to do it like I'm
[6151.00s -> 6170.47s]  swinging around. I didn't use the web. I didn't activate the web. 2000 IQ joke.
[6175.74s -> 6178.94s]  That wasn't supposed to be a fall joke. All right, I just get to the bonfire. What am I
[6178.94s -> 6188.98s]  doing? I don't want to ruin, I didn't ruin the game yet. I just, I didn't turn any
[6188.98s -> 6210.70s]  mods off. Okay. Oh, I can't touch the boss. Let's keep going. Can we just play
[6210.70s -> 6215.93s]  Dark Souls 3? I mean, that's kind of what I'm doing right now. Just in a different
[6215.93s -> 6235.83s]  perspective. I actually like this weapon. I do enjoy this weapon. A shield is
[6235.83s -> 6238.31s]  going to be so desperate here, though, because there's random enemies around
[6238.31s -> 6247.26s]  corners. I'm going to get fucking destroyed. Well, this is the parry
[6247.26s -> 6256.12s]  shield. Well, not really, but one of them. This is going to be hell. This
[6256.12s -> 6273.11s]  room is going to be hell. That's so cool. Cut this guy down.
[6273.11s -> 6293.46s]  All right. Is this VR? That would be insane if this was VR. VR would make this
[6293.46s -> 6298.04s]  game absolutely horrifying. And speaking of horrifying, I knew you were going to
[6298.04s -> 6305.86s]  show up. We've made it into E mode only mode. What happened? Was chat
[6305.86s -> 6323.11s]  misbehaving? Were they misbehaving? I can see them, though. So this is
[6323.11s -> 6334.62s]  fine. You can't sneak up on me. Little shit. Some of these come alive,
[6334.62s -> 6368.07s]  don't they? What happened? Why is chat in timeout right now? Don't ask me why I
[6368.07s -> 6381.34s]  did this. I guess it's free souls. You know what? I think I might get a
[6381.34s -> 6401.99s]  glass of wine. This is a wine night? Is it possible? Oh shit.
[6401.99s -> 6413.34s]  Don't look at it. Just dodge it. Oh my god. It just went through. It went
[6413.34s -> 6418.94s]  through his body. It went through his body. I couldn't see it. First person.
[6418.94s -> 6432.92s]  That's five community subs from Kazzy. Thank you, Kazzy. Thank you so much, Kazzy.
[6432.92s -> 6438.41s]  Five community subs. You rock. Thank you. Congratulations to those in the
[6438.41s -> 6442.06s]  community that can now do the Jerma Boomer Emo.
[6442.06s -> 6444.86s]  And you don't want to use that Emo anytime Jerma says something but he
[6444.86s -> 6451.14s]  sounds old. Make sure you put that in the chat so everyone knows what you're
[6451.14s -> 6457.08s]  talking about. If Jerma starts talking about the
[6457.16s -> 6461.59s]  Super Nintendo, make sure you put that Emo to the chat.
[6461.59s -> 6464.95s]  Did Jerma reference an old Nickelodeon cartoon? Make sure you put that in the
[6464.95s -> 6473.24s]  chat too. All right. I'm just spamming right now.
[6473.24s -> 6477.24s]  RFLSA thanks for the five community subs right back to back there. Thank
[6477.24s -> 6480.04s]  you.
[6491.56s -> 6498.81s]  Where am I? I was on the ground still.
[6501.96s -> 6506.20s]  Don't roll off the edge. What do I got for real estate? Not much.
[6506.20s -> 6512.98s]  Not.
[6521.72s -> 6538.87s]  Look at the wall. Holy. I buried it right in her head.
[6538.87s -> 6545.10s]  Let her hug you. Why would I do that? Let's just use somebody else's flasks for that.
[6545.10s -> 6548.70s]  God damn it. I need to go back. I'm just gonna run by this.
[6548.70s -> 6552.54s]  Isn't there a shard over here somewhere?
[6552.94s -> 6557.77s]  I know there's a Estes Shard somewhere in this area.
[6557.77s -> 6576.49s]  It's right there. All right. Let me go upgrade.
[6576.49s -> 6586.74s]  Stupid floating hand. Do a pure faith build. I'm not sure that would be a good
[6586.74s -> 6600.06s]  idea. Make sure to hydrate. Yeah, yeah. I
[6600.06s -> 6608.97s]  gotta get some water or wine. Which one? Water or wine?
[6608.97s -> 6619.64s]  That's a good question. Both? I could do both.
[6619.64s -> 6634.17s]  Ah. Okay. Five. Why would I kill him?
[6634.17s -> 6641.38s]  All right. Let's um... Do I have enough? I'm gonna just crush the...
[6641.38s -> 6651.43s]  I'm not gonna use this. I mean it's neat but I'm not gonna use it.
[6651.43s -> 6661.82s]  All right. 15-15. Looking at one in the decks.
[6661.82s -> 6670.50s]  Oh yeah. Is there any cheaters in here?
[6670.50s -> 6689.74s]  Bits got deleted. What do you mean? All right. I'm good.
[6689.74s -> 6695.27s]  And you know what? I'm just gonna upgrade this once. What do you think?
[6695.27s -> 6699.21s]  I'm gonna save the raw gem. I'm just gonna put
[6699.21s -> 6705.80s]  like a... I'm gonna do high five. Who cares?
[6705.80s -> 6723.59s]  Pretty be careful. I do. All right. Who's the boss? There's like two
[6723.59s -> 6727.05s]  bosses here. That's the tree. Tree's gonna be interesting in
[6727.05s -> 6730.94s]  first person. Hey Jerma, can you say yeah? I'm trying to prove something.
[6730.94s -> 6735.51s]  Sure.
[6736.31s -> 6750.50s]  Was that good enough? No. I can't just sprint through.
[6750.50s -> 6758.31s]  It's not gonna happen. Oh my god. He did it.
[6758.31s -> 6763.43s]  All right. There's a nest. There's a shard in the first area too.
[6763.43s -> 6769.03s]  It's in like the soup pit. Let's just keep going.
[6769.03s -> 6782.79s]  Hi. He just fell down and died. Who? Who is it?
[6782.79s -> 6788.57s]  Who is it? There's a guy underneath me. What the fuck?
[6788.57s -> 6803.58s]  Let's go down. All right. Now it's time to slow it down
[6803.58s -> 6821.30s]  and progress. God. Oh, there's people everywhere behind me too I think.
[6821.30s -> 6828.76s]  Don't roll off the cliff. Everyone's gonna laugh at you.
[6828.76s -> 6837.62s]  Oh. Somebody skipped 20. SkullyP. 20 community subs. Thank you so
[6837.62s -> 6842.18s]  much Skully. That's a shit load of money.
[6842.18s -> 6863.54s]  20 community subs. I just got double hit. I'm a sub now. A lot of you are subs now.
[6863.54s -> 6875.50s]  That's 20. There's the mummies down here, right? And the
[6875.50s -> 6878.54s]  the weird like person tentacle thing is here.
[6878.54s -> 6889.77s]  All right. Hold on. I gotta back it up. Isn't there an NPC?
[6889.77s -> 6894.65s]  New subs. Try. Oh, this is gonna be absolutely fucking awful.
[6894.65s -> 6919.88s]  This guy's hard. Ah. Just increases the
[6919.88s -> 6924.62s]  fear factor of this game by like at least three or four Joe
[6924.62s -> 6948.04s]  Ruggins. Yeah, I know the trick. Charcoal pine
[6948.04s -> 6958.34s]  route. Can you even put that on? That has to go on a blade, right?
[6958.34s -> 6963.78s]  Warrior of sunlight. Praise the sun. Drink the estus soup. Sure.
[6965.34s -> 6968.46s]  Even more community subs coming in from
[6968.46s -> 6972.87s]  SeaBear. Five community subs from SeaBear.
[6972.87s -> 6983.85s]  Thank you. You guys are just showering me with money.
[6984.17s -> 6994.47s]  Sometimes I just don't know what to say, so thank you. This is a legit horror
[6994.47s -> 6998.98s]  game. Yeah, it changes the whole landscape.
[6998.98s -> 7004.17s]  Every corner is dangerous. Everything is scary.
[7004.17s -> 7010.95s]  What does the plus two and minus two mean? Well,
[7010.95s -> 7014.23s]  a while ago, like maybe a year ago,
[7014.23s -> 7020.18s]  a buddy of mine, Talix and I, we did a thing where
[7020.18s -> 7023.54s]  we played a game. We had to beat the game in one sitting and we had
[7023.54s -> 7027.30s]  four hours to beat the whole game. It was Kane and Lynch 2.
[7027.30s -> 7031.86s]  So, but the stipulation with that was every time we made a really, really good
[7031.86s -> 7034.82s]  joke, we got to add time, and every time we made a really bad
[7034.82s -> 7044.23s]  joke, we got to, we had time reduced from the time.
[7044.23s -> 7051.56s]  Long story short, we did it. I don't want to spoil it because if you
[7051.56s -> 7054.20s]  haven't seen it, it's, it was a fun screen.
[7054.20s -> 7069.78s]  It's great. Nudity added like, what, subtracted an hour or two?
[7069.78s -> 7073.30s]  So, what do you guys think the wall will be here? Where first person
[7073.30s -> 7077.62s]  Dark Souls becomes pretty much not complete? What do you think?
[7077.62s -> 7084.79s]  What boss am I about to find? I am the wall.
[7084.79s -> 7090.23s]  There's no way I will get to Pontiff, but I would think Pontiff would
[7090.23s -> 7107.75s]  probably be pretty close. Unless I can parry every move.
[7107.75s -> 7111.67s]  This is a challenge though. This is, this, I highly recommend if you are
[7111.67s -> 7117.30s]  bored with Dark Souls or Dark Souls 3. I highly recommend you give this a
[7117.30s -> 7130.57s]  look because this, this is great. Where is he?
[7130.57s -> 7137.80s]  This dude. Oh shit. Oh, this is bad news.
[7137.96s -> 7154.31s]  I only have one flask. I have to see what that looks like in first person.
[7154.31s -> 7170.06s]  Is this a whip playthrough? It just looks like,
[7170.06s -> 7188.38s]  it doesn't even look like you're using a whip. No, put it away. I'm so
[7188.38s -> 7190.38s]  close to just being able to get through this.
[7190.38s -> 7200.95s]  Just give me my, give me my Lucerne. Whip and then dab on them. If we don't dab
[7200.95s -> 7225.90s]  on this shit. I'm down. I forgot. Oh you mother.
[7225.90s -> 7233.83s]  Bye bye. We're close. We're very close to just getting the,
[7233.83s -> 7244.26s]  I am so scared right now. I hear a cookie bug.
[7244.26s -> 7257.59s]  Where's the cookie bug? Yeah, the bonfire is right here.
[7266.49s -> 7272.23s]  Sit down. Sit down. Sit down!
[7282.81s -> 7288.92s]  So this is uh, it feels like I'm playing chivalry.
[7288.92s -> 7294.25s]  I could see that. The weapons seem to have the same weight,
[7294.25s -> 7309.21s]  same movement. That's a really good observation. All right,
[7309.21s -> 7316.54s]  progression. Although there are some things that I don't want to miss,
[7316.54s -> 7329.11s]  but I'm doing just fine. I've since gotten kind of used to the controls
[7329.11s -> 7334.95s]  though. Knowing when to, because if you stay
[7334.95s -> 7340.33s]  locked on, I still have to tilt right stick to move the camera, but it's
[7340.33s -> 7354.28s]  not as bad as it was before. Say that now and I'm about to lose.
[7354.28s -> 7357.64s]  No, we're not doing any more. I'm not gonna say it. I'm not even gonna
[7357.64s -> 7364.57s]  say it. Did I break up the wine yet? I have not.
[7364.57s -> 7380.06s]  Not yet. Somebody tell my roommate to stop snoring. Put me on speaker.
[7380.06s -> 7385.42s]  Hey. Hey. Hey, wake up for a second. Wake up for one second.
[7385.42s -> 7389.18s]  I mean, I don't want to be rude and I don't mean this in a mean way,
[7389.18s -> 7395.21s]  but this you're snoring and I mean it's hard for me to study. I'm
[7395.21s -> 7398.25s]  getting it. I got a very very, I got a tough paper due tomorrow
[7398.25s -> 7402.73s]  and I've got a math exam also tomorrow as well. So please, if like you could
[7402.73s -> 7406.50s]  maybe go to get a glass of water. Like, thanks.
[7406.50s -> 7410.82s]  Thank you, man. Really appreciate that. Like, thanks. I mean absolutely no
[7410.82s -> 7414.74s]  disrespect or rudeness when I say this. Thank you.
[7414.74s -> 7429.24s]  I cherish you as a roommate. You're a really good fucking friend.
[7429.24s -> 7436.84s]  Yeah, there you go. What is that? All right, can I see him from here?
[7436.84s -> 7451.27s]  He's on top of that building, right? Wow, that's crazy. All right, well we
[7451.27s -> 7459.19s]  gotta go. There's a, there's a bone shard
[7459.19s -> 7485.29s]  over there. Walked into a gravestone. Report that guy for stream sniping.
[7485.29s -> 7498.22s]  If I could, I would. Next mod? No, no, no, no. We, we got a long night. We
[7498.22s -> 7506.20s]  gotta, it's only been a couple hours. It's a long night. What is this guy
[7506.20s -> 7511.26s]  doing here? How did you even get over here? How
[7511.26s -> 7520.52s]  did he get over here? Come on, help me throw this.
[7520.52s -> 7540.90s]  Just give me the shard. I almost just threw up.
[7540.90s -> 7556.58s]  Ah, get up! Where am I? Get up! It's hell. All right, give me the items.
[7556.58s -> 7563.70s]  Isn't there some stuff here? There's embers, there's some souls here.
[7563.70s -> 7567.62s]  Also one of the mods that we have not done yet that is on tap
[7567.62s -> 7572.66s]  is everybody is an object. Everybody is camouflaged.
[7572.66s -> 7594.65s]  All right, get me through. Patch me in. Just give me the item. Why do I even care
[7594.65s -> 7598.49s]  about this item? It's a fucking club. It's a reinforced club.
[7598.49s -> 7602.94s]  It's not good. You don't, I don't want it. I got hit
[7602.94s -> 7625.08s]  by that on the way in. Side. Might be worth using this.
[7625.08s -> 7633.70s]  Idiot. Oh my god, you idiot. Just go. Nope, that's the wrong way. I have to
[7633.78s -> 7638.39s]  kill him. I have to.
[7638.79s -> 7667.27s]  Let me see. So this is 14-14. 105-18. I don't, I don't think so.
[7667.27s -> 7684.28s]  It's kind of ugly to swing it. That's very
[7684.28s -> 7687.64s]  just straight up and straight down. It's easier to take a look at, easier to
[7687.64s -> 7703.88s]  see. I would have been watching for what
[7703.88s -> 7706.76s]  it feels like forever. Me and my friends always quote silly
[7706.76s -> 7708.92s]  dumb quotes. Seeing you and Star meet up last year in stream was my favorite
[7709.00s -> 7715.30s]  part of 2018. Keep being you. Come visit England. England's pretty
[7715.30s -> 7720.65s]  cool. I would visit England, but thank you.
[7720.65s -> 7725.90s]  I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. Isn't there a secret wall somewhere over
[7725.90s -> 7732.57s]  here? I know there is. I'm going to Brazil.
[7732.57s -> 7741.45s]  I mean, whatever. I don't travel that much though, guys.
[7741.45s -> 7752.82s]  There's the shortcut there. Just got to get back up. That's really cool
[7752.82s -> 7769.62s]  looking. Bye. See ya.
[7769.70s -> 7780.66s]  Get me back to the bonfire. Wait, is this even, am I going the right way?
[7780.66s -> 7785.03s]  I don't think I'm going the right way. This is not the way to the bonfire.
[7785.03s -> 7789.74s]  I took a wrong turn. Holy shit, this is the wrong way.
[7789.74s -> 7799.34s]  It's down there, isn't it? No, it's not. Is this open?
[7799.34s -> 7817.46s]  Somebody's here. I can go down there, right? Yep, okay.
[7817.46s -> 7847.53s]  Drop down here. Whoa! What? No, isn't that, you gotta go up there. You
[7847.53s -> 7849.61s]  climb that, you open that door over there.
[7849.61s -> 7862.52s]  God damn. Can I run through this whole thing again?
[7862.52s -> 7879.14s]  Just don't stop, don't stop, don't stop. No reason to stop.
[7879.14s -> 7887.11s]  Lame two-hour first-person joke. I mean, I, I want, I, this is not like,
[7887.11s -> 7891.00s]  this is not a joke. I thought this was cool.
[7891.00s -> 7903.72s]  I want to see you play the whole, I don't think I'll do the whole game
[7903.72s -> 7909.86s]  like this. Okay, did I go the wrong way? No, I
[7909.86s -> 7920.76s]  gotta go get my souls. Don't talk to your father like that.
[7920.76s -> 7959.38s]  Throw that shit. Dark Souls 1 is the most funky when played in first person.
[7959.38s -> 7968.28s]  Don't you want to be able to say that you beat Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls, and
[7968.28s -> 7979.03s]  then Dark Souls 3 again? I mean, not necessarily.
[7979.03s -> 7993.32s]  I just like seeing the bosses. All right, I need,
[7993.32s -> 7996.52s]  uh, I need more strength, right? Or should I just,
[7996.52s -> 8010.10s]  no, I have to have at least like 15 strength, don't I?
[8010.10s -> 8024.52s]  Play Dark Souls Snap, what is Snap? And then you called me an idiot.
[8024.52s -> 8028.04s]  That's not how you get a request fulfilled, by the way.
[8028.04s -> 8031.40s]  If you go to the McDonald's drive-thru, or the Burger King drive-thru, or if you
[8031.40s -> 8034.84s]  go to any, it doesn't matter. Let's just use the drive-thru as an example.
[8034.84s -> 8038.44s]  Hey, welcome to McDonald's, how can I help you? Hey, yeah, um,
[8038.44s -> 8041.96s]  could you make me a number one with large fry,
[8041.96s -> 8051.08s]  idiot? They're gonna be like, uh, okay, did you want anything else? Uh, yeah,
[8051.08s -> 8060.42s]  can I get a large soda too, stupid? That person is gonna
[8060.42s -> 8081.18s]  do something bad to your food. They'll season it for me. No, they won't.
[8081.18s -> 8094.74s]  I was like, you go to like the customer, you call it like customer
[8094.74s -> 8097.46s]  service, and you have a problem with your
[8097.46s -> 8102.12s]  computer or something, or you, no, well that's not a good example.
[8102.12s -> 8105.08s]  Hey, if you call, if you would like go and get it to like your car
[8105.08s -> 8110.22s]  repaired or something. Yes, I think my brakes are making some
[8110.22s -> 8114.82s]  weird noises. Can you like to maybe do a check on
[8114.82s -> 8121.43s]  on my brakes, you fucking idiot? That's like ultra rude, that's so,
[8121.43s -> 8128.41s]  you would not do that anywhere else. Look,
[8128.41s -> 8139.78s]  you wouldn't steal a car, you wouldn't rob a bank,
[8139.78s -> 8150.76s]  so why would you steal a movie? Hi there.
[8160.34s -> 8167.32s]  I can't, he's protected. He's got, he has,
[8167.32s -> 8175.27s]  he has like fucking hockey gear on, I can't hurt him.
[8183.62s -> 8192.07s]  Idiot. Even in other places, okay, but first of all, you'd be like, well,
[8192.07s -> 8196.07s]  here's the thing Jeremy, is you're just broadcasting a live stream
[8196.07s -> 8199.67s]  on Twitch, and there's a bunch of people here in the audience,
[8199.67s -> 8202.07s]  and we're all here, and we're all watching, so it's like, you know, that
[8202.07s -> 8204.55s]  person, of course, is there's a reason for that, like someone's going to call
[8204.55s -> 8207.59s]  you an idiot for no reason, really. When was the last time you went to
[8207.59s -> 8210.74s]  a play during a live performance, like a
[8210.74s -> 8213.62s]  performance on stage? You're with like potentially a thousand people in
[8213.62s -> 8216.66s]  that audience. Right in the middle of like Romeo and
[8216.66s -> 8219.14s]  Juliet drinking the poison, are you going to stand up and be like, you
[8219.14s -> 8233.13s]  do suck, idiots. You're going to get thrown out,
[8233.13s -> 8239.02s]  comparing streaming to fine art. A school play
[8239.02s -> 8246.02s]  is fine art, like a retelling of like the eighth grade Lion King
[8246.02s -> 8250.95s]  is fine art. Is that what you're saying to me?
[8250.95s -> 8270.22s]  No, I know I'm lost, because are you calling them an idiot? No, I'm
[8270.22s -> 8274.06s]  see, I almost walked into that one, but no, no, I've got a lot going on
[8274.06s -> 8277.50s]  upstairs, so I'm able to dodge and swing
[8277.50s -> 8294.09s]  around those slippery questions. All right, let's do this one.
[8294.09s -> 8305.58s]  This is going to be cool in first person. Come on, activate,
[8305.58s -> 8314.98s]  activate. I just want to look at it, I just want to watch.
[8314.98s -> 8324.76s]  This is sweet, kill everybody. Wow, that was close,
[8324.76s -> 8329.94s]  and you're the one that hits me, really. Holy
[8329.94s -> 8339.94s]  shit, that's wild. I gotta like pop his pimples.
[8339.94s -> 8352.31s]  Whoa, I can't even move, what's going on?
[8352.39s -> 8365.93s]  All right, give me his arm, his wrist, right under there, right here.
[8365.93s -> 8372.44s]  This thing should be having a breach too. Where am I, what's going on?
[8372.44s -> 8390.39s]  We may have actually hit the wall here.
[8390.39s -> 8396.70s]  It's gonna be so hard to get this. Got it.
[8396.70s -> 8406.54s]  Barely. If it wasn't for you, I would have probably already done it
[8406.54s -> 8432.86s]  three times now. Oh my goodness, and obliterate the
[8432.90s -> 8441.83s]  balls. Isn't this fight optional? Yeah, well,
[8441.83s -> 8449.93s]  it's probably one of the cooler bosses to see in first person
[8449.93s -> 8466.76s]  in my personal pizza, you know. I'm gonna go right for his belly,
[8466.76s -> 8480.44s]  but I still have to break the other parts. I'm gonna go try to do this
[8480.44s -> 8484.68s]  very fast. I'm going right into his
[8484.68s -> 8488.78s]  sternum. I know you guys are calling it something else, but I refuse to
[8488.78s -> 8491.34s]  participate in that. I'm not gonna call it the thing
[8491.34s -> 8494.70s]  that you guys are calling it. Not nice, it's rude.
[8494.70s -> 8499.48s]  Nobody just said idiot. I can, I can smell it, I can feel it, I can
[8499.48s -> 8515.38s]  feel it.
[8516.26s -> 8525.30s]  I'm getting, I'm in like the liquid. I'm in the liquid you should not be.
[8525.30s -> 8537.43s]  Get out of here. Holy shit, he just stepped on my head.
[8537.43s -> 8567.42s]  Is he gonna roll on me? Is this music?
[8567.42s -> 8589.88s]  Oh! It's scary every time. Back it up, back it up, back it up. Only a few
[8589.92s -> 8606.62s]  more hits and you should go down. Shit! I need him to spin around. I'm not
[8606.62s -> 8627.50s]  getting stuck in this wall. We're in this way, come on man. Why
[8627.50s -> 8637.93s]  has, shouldn't this have blown up by now?
[8637.93s -> 8649.21s]  Jesus. I think this encounter might be foggled. We'll find out.
[8649.21s -> 8672.74s]  Sweep, you can go for a sweep right next to me.
[8672.74s -> 8687.85s]  Hey, there's no music either. Can't see the enemies behind me.
[8694.44s -> 8712.92s]  Uh, I'm fighting a giant baby. I'm gonna die to the fucking standard
[8712.92s -> 8723.67s]  enemy, aren't I? Turn music on. He's doing it. I'm gonna
[8723.67s -> 8727.54s]  get him. There's somebody next to me, there's somebody next to me.
[8727.54s -> 8762.54s]  Where are they? Behind me? No, no, no, use this.
[8762.54s -> 8783.61s]  Did I use it? What the f- Why? What? I hit use. Shit.
[8783.61s -> 8787.48s]  All right, this time, I'm gonna get it this time. All right, get this on the
[8787.48s -> 8790.36s]  hot bar because, like get these stupid, what the hell is
[8790.36s -> 8797.06s]  this even on here for? We basically died to Pinwheel.
[8797.06s -> 8801.27s]  I didn't die to, I just like touched my face four times.
[8801.27s -> 8810.65s]  In, no, I'm gonna get it. I don't think we're gonna see those other mods
[8810.65s -> 8815.50s]  tonight. No, I'm having, this is fun. I like
[8815.50s -> 8827.72s]  this. We got a long night. It's only been two and a half hours. I
[8827.72s -> 8829.88s]  really appreciate you giving your best out there.
[8829.88s -> 8844.73s]  Idiot. I'm going for it again. This actually is gonna suck if this is a
[8844.81s -> 8848.33s]  bugged encounter, because of the mods, and I have to fight
[8848.33s -> 8868.50s]  them the whole time with all these idiots around.
[8868.50s -> 8871.80s]  It's so hard to keep track of where these people are.
[8871.80s -> 8877.02s]  Oh, this is not good. Thank you for doing that. I really appreciate it.
[8877.02s -> 8889.42s]  Why are you here? What is he doing? He just stabbed me in the chest. I lost
[8889.42s -> 8894.36s]  control of my, what are you doing? Why can you do that?
[8894.36s -> 8945.96s]  Where is he? Wait, am I not even hitting him?
[8945.96s -> 8955.59s]  Oh, did he actually hit me with that? I can't believe he actually got it.
[8955.59s -> 8982.54s]  Let's go. Oh my god, this is hell. This is living hell.
[8982.54s -> 9009.08s]  What? Get away from me. Come here. Get, he's too big.
[9009.08s -> 9013.56s]  I think we may have found the wall. It's very possible.
[9013.56s -> 9017.40s]  All right, I don't know why that, you saw it happen. I took him down to
[9017.56s -> 9022.76s]  30% last time. What's up with that? Here we go.
[9022.76s -> 9040.36s]  I just actually kind of scared him. So why does it happen that time?
[9040.36s -> 9053.85s]  And then another one on his elbow. All right, fine, I'm gonna do it.
[9053.85s -> 9061.80s]  Gotta get the one on his back. He rolls,
[9061.80s -> 9076.71s]  bumps all down. How to get with the overhead swings. The only way I can hit
[9076.71s -> 9085.11s]  it. What have you done? What have you done? What do you think? What have you done?
[9085.43s -> 9109.77s]  What have you done? Bump it. Now he's got one more on the side.
[9118.50s -> 9133.62s]  I'm trying to bump it. It's hard to bump.
[9133.62s -> 9144.25s]  Fuck, away from me. Please don't do it. Oh, judging,
[9144.25s -> 9156.55s]  judging the distance. Die. Where's the last one? It's on his elbow.
[9156.55s -> 9164.68s]  He has to fall down for that one. Come on, stand up.
[9164.68s -> 9175.86s]  Stand up and walk and then fall. Oh, what have I thought about doing here?
[9176.90s -> 9192.04s]  You can hit the hand. I don't, I, I'm not risking it. He falls straight down.
[9192.76s -> 9198.84s]  I just, am I gauging this? Which elbow is it? Other elbow. Fuck.
[9199.64s -> 9201.96s]  I'm so scared. I, I gotta get on the right side.
[9208.78s -> 9211.82s]  Wait, it's on his hand? Didn't I get the, I thought I got the one on his hand already.
[9212.54s -> 9216.02s]  He's rolling. Which,
[9216.02s -> 9231.11s]  The whole hand. Yeah, but this, this is another actual like blood boil.
[9231.83s -> 9254.06s]  All right, it's, here we go. He's gonna fall. All right.
[9254.06s -> 9263.70s]  I didn't almost die to the pinwheel of Dark Souls 3.
[9263.70s -> 9266.18s]  Guess what? If you played Dark Souls 1 with this mod,
[9267.06s -> 9270.98s]  pinwheel would probably be hard. You probably wouldn't lose to pinwheel.
[9274.04s -> 9290.54s]  Are you calling me an idiot? No.
[9292.50s -> 9295.94s]  All right, two and a half hours. I think it's time for a wine break.
[9296.82s -> 9309.61s]  I think I'm gonna get a glass of wine.
[9310.25s -> 9315.11s]  Ah, tastes good, wouldn't it? What do you think? Should I, does that sound like fun to you?
[9315.99s -> 9319.56s]  All right, I need 15. Be careful.
[9320.84s -> 9323.88s]  15 strength, and then, what does this even scale off of?
[9323.88s -> 9330.18s]  I haven't even paid attention to that. Just D, D, D, okay.
[9330.82s -> 9342.46s]  But I can use it with one hand. Welcome us.
[9342.46s -> 9345.34s]  A break from whining, this sounds pretty good. Have I, I haven't been whining.
[9347.62s -> 9357.59s]  15, and then I'm gonna go 15, 15, 15. Look at this quality build.
[9364.14s -> 9367.58s]  Using chat as an excuse to drink. What?
[9367.58s -> 9375.94s]  All right, I need a big, cool shield. Physical 100, that's the night shield.
[9378.89s -> 9380.81s]  Magic, physical, we're going with this one.
[9382.25s -> 9385.27s]  I mean, I know it's really annoying and it's in the way, but come on.
[9385.91s -> 9389.19s]  Can I, I can stab. I can't, I need a proper spear for that.
[9389.19s -> 9401.48s]  But if VR worked, this would you do it? It'd be interesting, but impossible.
[9402.28s -> 9407.96s]  Just the nature of how this game is played is you can't, I don't know if there'd be a way to
[9408.84s -> 9420.33s]  bind right stick or mouse to head, maybe. I don't know, but wait a second though.
[9421.29s -> 9425.37s]  That's right, that boss soul is a spear. But is it a piece of shit?
[9426.49s -> 9432.97s]  I've never used it. I'm not telling enough to jump over there either.
[9436.92s -> 9440.66s]  It is? Let me see.
[9449.59s -> 9461.64s]  Okay, Arstor's spear. Take a large step forward to make a single focused thrust.
[9470.71s -> 9481.75s]  Maybe it's worth trying. Although I was under the assumption that in Dark Souls 3,
[9481.75s -> 9486.22s]  pretty much all the boss soul weapons are absolutely terrible. Unless you're doing
[9486.22s -> 9493.35s]  PvP. I heard that some of the boss soul weapons are good in PvP, but not for PvE.
[9493.35s -> 9501.86s]  Is that what I've been told? That's wrong. Why does everybody have to lie to me?
[9502.50s -> 9510.28s]  All right, I don't think I want this. Although maybe I do. It might be worth trying.
[9511.00s -> 9524.73s]  The Rotted Greatsword is amazing. Get the Greatsword. Yeah, but I can,
[9524.73s -> 9532.68s]  can I even use this? I'm going to try to use the spear. I have, I don't have 19.
[9539.72s -> 9554.81s]  I need dex, but I can get dex. 18, 19. But it's probably quick.
[9560.87s -> 9570.04s]  This is a great sword though. It's gonna be slow as hell. Yeah, this is not gonna work in
[9570.04s -> 9574.28s]  first person. I'm going with the spear. Everyone's gonna be very upset. Very upset
[9574.28s -> 9601.26s]  with me. It's got poison on it too. Nice. All right, I need 19 dex. What do I have right now?
[9601.26s -> 9609.66s]  I have some of these. How many do I need to level up?
[9612.86s -> 9629.27s]  3,600. The streamer has made an error. Yeah, but I mean, we're just doing like,
[9629.83s -> 9634.23s]  this is not a full playthrough. This is playing with first person with mods.
[9635.19s -> 9636.95s]  It's okay if I pick the bad weapon, isn't it?
[9637.91s -> 9642.79s]  Very well taken. God damn it. I need like fucking 45 souls.
[9646.20s -> 9665.14s]  All right, well I gotta go get those souls. So this is a full playthrough. What? I might
[9665.14s -> 9680.97s]  as well just go get the pickaxe. All right, so now we go to, well what is, what is actually
[9680.97s -> 9690.39s]  the next thing? That's optional. Just to get the, what actually is the next boss?
[9691.35s -> 9696.63s]  Oh, the abyss watchers, right? Okay, I remember. But I'm gonna just kill a guy and then go
[9696.63s -> 9718.66s]  level up because I'm gonna level up dexterity. Let's go. Abyss watchers is going to end
[9718.66s -> 9729.75s]  the first person thing. It very well, it very well may, but that's all right. Okay,
[9729.75s -> 9739.61s]  where, what the hell is the bonfire? I just was on it. It's so disorienting down here.
[9744.74s -> 9756.47s]  Hello? Yeah, abyss watchers could be the wall and then when we will turn on something else.
[9757.27s -> 9765.98s]  Overdose. I might beat abyss watcher first try. I did bork first try. Anything's possible.
[9775.27s -> 9782.14s]  All right, let's go to the watchers. Wait, no, I was supposed to go get a glass of wine.
[9783.02s -> 9788.62s]  Yeah, we're only three hours in, guys. What time is it? It's like 6 30. We're good.
[9788.62s -> 9811.98s]  I can drink a glass of wine. Let's give it a go. I'll be right back. I haven't left yet. I
[9811.98s -> 9815.90s]  haven't had a glass of wine on stream in like three and a half weeks. Four weeks. It's been
[9815.90s -> 9821.10s]  like a month. I can't enjoy a glass of wine on stream once a month? Then once every couple
[9821.10s -> 9829.51s]  months? No, no, no, no, no. I thought you left. Sometimes I just sit here and just take
[9829.51s -> 9833.94s]  a look at what you guys are saying and I determine if I like what you're saying.
[9834.66s -> 9838.02s]  If you don't, then I will ban the words. I will make it so you can't say those things.
[9838.02s -> 9847.30s]  I'm gonna first try the abyss watchers in first person, or if I don't, then I'm gonna
[9848.50s -> 10134.55s]  not drink the wine. I'll pour it into the sink on stream. I'm not gonna do that. I broke the
[10134.55s -> 10139.35s]  fucking cork. It's all right, though. I was just struggling down there.
[10141.51s -> 10146.23s]  I was struggling to get this thing open. I have a new wine opener that I haven't used.
[10147.03s -> 10148.87s]  I fucked it all up. All right.
[10152.06s -> 10161.43s]  It's the first time trying this. Who knows? It could be fucking gross. Why do I have this hair
[10161.43s -> 10170.06s]  all over this? I can't even drink this hair in this. A ton of it. Is this glass even clean?
[10170.06s -> 10176.89s]  There's like dog hair in here. God damn it. I just wanted to drink a little bit.
[10178.01s -> 10181.74s]  Who cares? All right, let's go. Where we going? We're going to under the bridge.
[10186.89s -> 10189.85s]  Jerma, if you get drunk, can you sing a Foo Fighters song for us?
[10189.85s -> 10201.19s]  You think a glass of wine is gonna get me drunk? What? That's pretty good. All right, let's go.
[10202.44s -> 10209.88s]  Watchers first try. All right, piss in the sink. So the question is, ah, I gotta go. I
[10209.88s -> 10227.64s]  remember now. I'm gonna go this way. I forgot he did that. He does it like five times, right?
[10229.05s -> 10244.86s]  Super charge. Am I thinking, I don't even need to fight this guy. I'm not,
[10244.86s -> 10255.80s]  I don't even need to fight this guy. Can I get his bowl? He's gonna go cross.
[10264.92s -> 10274.33s]  That was pretty ridiculous in first person. I'm not a dog. They're the worst.
[10279.56s -> 10298.30s]  Oh, he just allied me. Okay, cool trick. Where? This way. Stop playing leapfrog. Get out of my
[10298.30s -> 10314.20s]  pathing. Help. Bart, what's his name? Bart? Don't. You can't kill him, right? Get the
[10314.20s -> 10349.38s]  fucking dogs away from me. Ah, how did that not hit? Somebody is shaking me violently. Good job.
[10349.38s -> 10374.17s]  Nice work, Jeremy. Okay. Play Simpsons hit and run first person. I'll do that now. Right
[10374.17s -> 10382.98s]  now. Another one of those unkind, all euphem. If you let them go, you'll face death and it
[10382.98s -> 10390.60s]  won't be pretty. Enough death to leave you broken. I remember this guy. He's got a cool
[10390.60s -> 10402.47s]  hammer. I'm gonna go up the elevator and around and then you've, we're finally, we're
[10402.47s -> 10413.26s]  gonna get to see, uh, what's his name? We'll see that. He's not alive? Of course I'm not
[10413.26s -> 10425.61s]  gonna do that right now. Donny, can you go? It's like two play. Yeah, it's right.
[10427.13s -> 10436.68s]  Whoops. You all right? You actually get to see what he looks like.
[10438.20s -> 10446.06s]  Oh, absorbed in thought. I am Siegwert of Katarina. To be honest, I'm in a bit of a
[10446.06s -> 10452.39s]  pickle. Have you ever walked near a white birch only to be struck by, well, whoever
[10452.39s -> 10462.95s]  it is, but I have to. Well, okay. Well, everybody loves this guy. This guy, we, everybody loves
[10462.95s -> 10473.05s]  him, but I'm gonna push him into the elevator. Just fuck him. Just kidding. Don't skip his
[10473.05s -> 10479.85s]  dialogue. You've heard his dialogue like three times. Those are you Dark Souls fanatics.
[10479.85s -> 10510.98s]  You've almost just botched that one. Wait, no, that's the actual way to go. Shit. I
[10510.98s -> 10520.62s]  wasn't supposed to do that. Is there a way I can fall? I don't think I can make, can I land on
[10520.62s -> 10548.89s]  one of these brackets here? I don't think so. I could do a homeward bone. Well, you can't do
[10548.89s -> 10556.54s]  that. Sorry, I know we don't. That just gave me anxiety. I'm sorry. It is very anxious in
[10556.54s -> 10566.65s]  first person though. I remember complaining about this bridge because I'm running back
[10566.65s -> 10589.24s]  and the whole bridge is filled with people. I remember this. That's creepy. All right,
[10589.24s -> 10602.95s]  close the door. Oh, no, no, no. Zickward. Squidward. Good luck, Squidward. Go up.
[10604.73s -> 10624.98s]  He'll be fine. No, I have to wait till they despawn before I can help him.
[10625.70s -> 10646.60s]  I didn't get my souls. I didn't have any souls. Who cares? Oh, I forgot about this guy.
[10653.70s -> 10670.20s]  Let's run. Just run. I don't need to fight him. Run away. Oh, he can't come out of his
[10670.20s -> 10684.36s]  domain. All right. Give me the bonfire. I can't even let them do anything. These guys will
[10684.36s -> 10695.64s]  kill me in one second. Bonfire is like right here. Where's the bonfire? It's right here.
[10697.86s -> 10706.12s]  Where is it? Don't say boomer vision. It is boomer vision. It's first person vision. Where
[10706.12s -> 10736.55s]  is it? It's right here. Actually blind. I'm thinking of the second bonfire. The other bonfire
[10736.55s -> 10740.31s]  is up on a hill like that. Come on, it's been like two years since I played this game
[10740.31s -> 10761.21s]  and I'm in FPS mode. No, I thought I killed him. I got a backstab. No, that's not clean enough.
[10761.21s -> 10780.87s]  Go back. Yeah, I know. Hold on. I'm going to kill this guy. We're going to fight this guy
[10781.51s -> 10784.07s]  the way that I should be fighting this guy, which is with the shield.
[10807.14s -> 10838.30s]  Died to the pleb filter. That's not. It's different when you have this. I'm not even
[10838.30s -> 10845.98s]  going to explain myself. Why would I explain myself? Can this guy even be carried?
[10848.39s -> 10882.71s]  I don't think he can be carried. He can be. If we get good. That frost boon.
[10890.42s -> 10900.95s]  It's just so hard to turn that fast. It's blocking on. Doesn't do it.
[10903.05s -> 10940.49s]  It's possible. Still possible. Jesus. I don't even know what the fuck he is.
[10941.05s -> 10953.86s]  I almost got him. One more hit. Two more hits. Damn. With the sword.
[10957.83s -> 10967.66s]  Somebody just pressed F. Somebody said F. That was a little early to press F. I need to practice.
[10971.21s -> 10978.26s]  Yeah, this thing is cool. I mean, look at it. It looks cool in first person, too.
[10990.55s -> 11008.31s]  Be Iceman? No, I can't be Iceman. I could. I could. This doesn't scale with magic at all.
[11008.31s -> 11014.86s]  It just has frost effect on it. I mean, I've already got the. It's just scales with
[11014.86s -> 11025.40s]  just the D in both of them. For now, though, we're going to continue to use the weapon
[11025.40s -> 11032.10s]  that has good scaling and damage right now. Go help Sigward. He's crying. I will.
[11032.82s -> 11046.68s]  Yeah, I'm trying to think of the. There are going to be a few moments that will
[11048.17s -> 11054.52s]  probably actually be uncompletable. I wonder if they are. Some of the bosses
[11054.52s -> 11069.99s]  that move around so quickly that you can't turn to see them. All right. All right, Sigward.
[11071.51s -> 11083.37s]  You're up there. The gator dogs. Yeah, I know I have a lot of other mods, but
[11085.62s -> 11096.14s]  I'm still very much enjoying what we're doing right now. Oops. Well, actually,
[11096.14s -> 11115.61s]  I probably need to go up here anyways. Mr. Giant. Who are you? I help any time.
[11116.49s -> 11126.01s]  OK. I help. So cut the shit. Kill. Kill. Kill. Don't say that. Stop saying that.
[11127.61s -> 11134.31s]  All right. Now let's do the Sigward quest line, which is this way.
[11137.08s -> 11140.52s]  No, I was looking the wrong way. First person. It makes you disoriented.
[11141.48s -> 11160.58s]  Hmm. Oh, don't disappear like that. You have me downright worried.
[11162.36s -> 11169.24s]  Thanks to you, an epiphany has struck me. I've unraveled the riddle of this inscrutable lift.
[11172.04s -> 11176.44s]  All right. You ready to fight the big monster? I went up the tower.
[11177.48s -> 11183.32s]  Anyhow, do you see that that humongous beast? He looks even better in first
[11183.32s -> 11190.44s]  person. I know coward and I have a steady hand, but that thing. Now think twice before you go
[11190.44s -> 11197.64s]  down that road. All right. That means you're going to help. Let's go. I've got to wait.
[11197.64s -> 11201.88s]  You weren't supposed to do that without me. I said, well, I've had arena.
[11204.54s -> 11217.58s]  He goes, no, I said it's like a really hard strange beginning of the vowel there. He goes,
[11217.66s -> 11230.50s]  die Sigward of Catarina. Ready? Die. You should have waited.
[11231.88s -> 11239.66s]  Well, it's too late now. Die Sigward of the Knights of Catarina. Fight by your side.
[11239.66s -> 11251.82s]  This is awesome in first person. Oh, nice swing. Good job, Sigward.
[11253.18s -> 11299.22s]  We can work together. Don't call for flip. Cocktail. Cocktail. We did it. This is when
[11299.22s -> 11306.12s]  you learn the toast. You get to have a beer. That was cool. That was quite a performance,
[11306.92s -> 11314.71s]  but you must, we unkindled must put our duties first. But for the moment we have a toast to
[11314.71s -> 11323.06s]  make. Sigward. To your valor, my sword. And long may the sun shine. Kidding, I'm not going
[11323.06s -> 11338.09s]  to kill him. All right, there's some items that I remember. Why are we doing Dark Souls 3
[11338.09s -> 11342.81s]  again? Well, because this is a this is a different kind of Dark Souls. This is Dark Souls 3.
[11343.61s -> 11349.08s]  But as you can see, there's something else going on here. Interesting mod to play the game in
[11349.08s -> 11366.30s]  first person. I didn't toast him. Why would I? Same, but different. That's true. I thought
[11366.30s -> 11372.74s]  this is VR. I would go put on the VR helmet and make the VR joke, but I don't have it
[11372.74s -> 11387.32s]  anymore. Go back and toast or I'm going to leave. Well, just because you said that,
[11387.32s -> 11404.18s]  I'm going to go do a full R2 and hit him off the cliff. There's a really nice ring that's up here
[11404.18s -> 11413.74s]  in there somewhere. It's up over that way. I got a full R2 swing this guy. Fine, here's your
[11413.74s -> 11436.04s]  taunt. What is it? Okay, toast. Here, here. A toast to our never-ending friendship. There it
[11436.04s -> 11453.91s]  is. You're the only competent Souls streamer I've seen this year. That that means a lot
[11453.91s -> 11463.58s]  considering I've struggled a lot with this game when I first played it. I am playing in gosh damn
[11463.58s -> 11470.90s]  first person. Wow, what a confidence boost. Thank you for that. Seriously, that was a super
[11470.90s -> 11478.70s]  confidence boost. I can do anything now. I'm capable of anything. For real, thank you. This
[11478.70s -> 11484.36s]  year. Yeah, but there are some incredibly talented, amazing Souls players. People that
[11484.36s -> 11488.76s]  beat the game without getting hit. People that beat the game in fucking 45 minutes. People
[11488.76s -> 11492.36s]  that get lost in an area that they don't remember because they haven't played the
[11492.36s -> 11495.72s]  game in a while and they forget where they're going. You know, there are those streamers out
[11495.72s -> 11502.10s]  there and be careful. Don't watch them. If you come across somebody that like is kind of walking
[11502.10s -> 11505.86s]  in circles and they don't really remember where to go, like do not watch that stream
[11505.86s -> 11518.98s]  because is it really worth watching? Be careful of those streams. There's two ladies upstairs
[11518.98s -> 11527.02s]  from what I remember. There's two fat ladies up here. I remember doing this, but there is
[11527.10s -> 11538.17s]  something nice up here. It's worth a try. Yep, yeah, sometimes I don't remember
[11539.37s -> 11546.63s]  where the enemies are spawned and it's all right. This year. Yeah, but that's okay.
[11547.51s -> 11568.46s]  That's a good compliment. I'm sorry, it is. Dogs, right? Holy shit, didn't even see you.
[11570.62s -> 11576.14s]  Oh, there's three. There's too many. I gotta run. Come on, now I gotta keep it up. I gotta
[11576.14s -> 11601.22s]  keep it up. Like this year, right? Come on. Okay, we're good. I got a reputation now to uphold.
[11606.71s -> 11612.79s]  I know there are two ladies up here. I just really hope they don't turn off my stream.
[11617.72s -> 11626.33s]  Come on, fall. Come on. All of you come down. I know you will. There they are. What's the
[11626.33s -> 11630.34s]  strategy? What's the game plan here for these two in first person? Somebody just gave a ton of
[11630.34s -> 11646.89s]  money. $3,500. $3,500. Thank you. I was going to donate a million bits since you're playing
[11646.89s -> 11650.65s]  like a pro Dark Souls player, but then I remembered that you died to Pinwheel and it was
[11650.65s -> 11669.05s]  shameful. Well, thank you so much for the $35. But the person that said I was the most
[11669.05s -> 11672.65s]  competent Souls player this year, I want you to make sure you understand this. That's a joke.
[11672.65s -> 11679.13s]  It's a lie. I beat Pinwheel first try on a blind playthrough last year. It's a joke. It's a funny
[11679.13s -> 11685.72s]  thing. I'm still your favorite Dark Souls streamer this year. All right, we're gonna
[11685.72s -> 11715.40s]  alluring seagull and run. Hello? All right, here's the ring. Flynn's ring. I remember this
[11715.40s -> 11731.46s]  being very good. Isn't there something else up top here too? Lowering equipment load
[11731.46s -> 11742.07s]  increases attack. Put the damn thing on. So this is it. You take off all your clothes.
[11742.71s -> 11754.39s]  All right, we gotta go. Where's the other one? There's another one over here, right?
[11759.43s -> 11768.58s]  Gonna make this jump down to here. And there's an item over here. Oh, that's not what I was
[11768.58s -> 11784.84s]  looking for. Nudity equals power. Maybe I should just take it all off now. Oh, fuck. Okay,
[11784.84s -> 11799.88s]  hold on. If I can go from here to there. I'm gonna die here. It's not gonna be pretty.
[11800.52s -> 11819.90s]  Oh, I'm good. There's the vest. The trousers. Okay, that's the ring I'm thinking of. This is
[11819.90s -> 11825.77s]  the anti-poison one, right? No, that's the best ring in the game. That's the best ring
[11825.77s -> 11842.81s]  in the whole game. Now I remember. Didn't I take my gloves off? Why do I still have
[11842.81s -> 11852.44s]  these night gloves on? All right, now we can keep progressing. Am I gonna beat Dark
[11852.44s -> 11859.69s]  Souls 3 tonight on stream? In first person? Absolutely not. But I mean, we're still going.
[11867.56s -> 11875.61s]  All right. I could probably just bone out of here. Yeah, I'm just gonna bone. What was
[11875.61s -> 11881.90s]  the last? It doesn't matter. Oh, yeah, I forgot. In Dark Souls 3, it doesn't matter.
[11882.62s -> 11898.78s]  Should I? Maybe I should just upgrade this and just keep going with it.
[11899.90s -> 11906.01s]  I'm never gonna be cool enough to have the spear, I don't think. Is it 18, right?
[11910.04s -> 11913.16s]  I could get it. Yeah, let's put the spear on. Let's do the thing we wanted to do.
[11919.82s -> 11925.45s]  How many more do I need for this piece of absolute shit? Where is it?
[11927.42s -> 11939.30s]  19. I can get that shit right now. This thing's really ugly. It's got it. It's got a nice feel
[11939.30s -> 11945.66s]  to it, though. It's quick. He lied about having other mods. That's not true.
[11949.03s -> 11962.78s]  I have a bunch. Show us then. I can't, though, because we're doing so we're having
[11962.78s -> 11984.33s]  so much fun. We can come back to this? Look, I'm having a great time. I can't stop.
[11985.13s -> 12002.14s]  I'm sorry. Stop having fun. No, I refuse. I refuse to stop having fun.
[12006.18s -> 12010.50s]  Change mods and go back to the save. Yeah, I could. All right, here's what's gonna happen.
[12010.50s -> 12027.64s]  Are you ready? I'm gonna go beat Abyss Watchers, and then after Abyss Watchers, sure.
[12030.36s -> 12037.88s]  How playable is this mod? From what you can see on the screen, it's very playable. I thought
[12037.88s -> 12043.32s]  the dodge roll was gonna be headache-inducing. What it essentially does is it just fixes the
[12043.32s -> 12052.22s]  camera in a spot that is always pointing forward no matter where, so it's pretty great.
[12053.58s -> 12058.06s]  Oh, the crystal mage. Oh no, the crystal mage. I died 15 times to crystal mage in my first
[12058.06s -> 12064.41s]  playthrough. It's probably gonna happen again. All right, let's go. Let's go. I can use this
[12064.41s -> 12072.09s]  with two hands, right? No, I can't. I need another level. I have so many of these.
[12079.05s -> 12090.92s]  That's almost as embarrassing as Pinwheel. That's fine. You have to do crystal mage
[12090.92s -> 12096.06s]  in first person. That's gonna make it a thousand times harder. I also want the...
[12099.64s -> 12105.18s]  I love this. Here's the thing about Dark Souls and Souls games in general,
[12105.18s -> 12111.82s]  those of you that are here that are big fans of these games. If I could eternal sunshine
[12111.82s -> 12116.46s]  of the spotless mind and wipe out me ever playing this game, I would do it like once a
[12116.46s -> 12122.46s]  month. I don't know how that would cause irreparable damage to my brain, but it'd be
[12122.46s -> 12127.06s]  great. Being able to play this game and experience it again in a way that you never
[12127.06s -> 12139.53s]  have is all... it's just... it's really fun. So I'm sort of vicariously living through myself
[12139.53s -> 12156.52s]  again, if that makes sense. I didn't realize it was gonna be this much fun. It does not make
[12156.52s -> 12165.77s]  sense. Well, it doesn't have to. Get those funny mods on, you clown streamer. But not
[12165.77s -> 12168.89s]  every... not every single stream has to be a clown stream, right? Don't you know?
[12169.21s -> 12181.78s]  We can do first person Dark Souls. That's objectively wrong. No, we don't have to have
[12181.78s -> 12187.37s]  every stream be a clown stream. I promise, like in a couple days, you'll hear me go like,
[12188.01s -> 12210.78s]  it'll happen. Really? Yeah. I promise you'll hear at least one or two clown horns. Oh,
[12210.78s -> 12221.67s]  fuck. And it doesn't matter because we're about to get to the Abyss Watchers
[12222.63s -> 12226.07s]  and I'm going to quit the game. And I'm going to start over and we're going to do
[12226.07s -> 12237.13s]  times 40 speed. And then everyone can make their clown noise. Clown horns. You're like
[12237.13s -> 12241.61s]  two hours away. Not for somebody that's played this game two or three times. In a row. On
[12241.61s -> 12245.37s]  stream. And then off stream. And then as sorcery. And beat the game as sorcery.
[12246.87s -> 12260.10s]  Okay, where's the butcher's knife, lady? Not till over here.
[12267.94s -> 12277.66s]  Freeze right now? Really, it's not. Jesus, that's scary. Somebody else is here.
[12278.38s -> 12301.58s]  And then one inside of the circus wagon. Hurt you? No, don't do it. No, don't do it.
[12305.85s -> 12313.56s]  Respect to pure faith after Abyss Watchers. You know, I just might do that. Probably not
[12313.56s -> 12323.02s]  though, because I have the spear. You can't, how do you, why is that video thing even a
[12323.02s -> 12339.83s]  command anymore? What video thing? Is it video command thing? A spear. Isn't there,
[12339.83s -> 12350.54s]  there's a lady over there. Yes, there she is. Found her. Let's kill the butcher and get the
[12350.54s -> 12360.23s]  butcher's cleaver. There you are. Come on. Remember I made the Wizard of Oz reference
[12360.23s -> 12397.77s]  when I first streamed this game? Okay, all right, calm down, lady. Oh, shit! Oh,
[12397.77s -> 12418.95s]  shit! Butcher knife. It's a pretty good weapon. I think I used this for a majority of time
[12418.95s -> 12424.94s]  that I played Dark Souls 3 the first time. It's a pretty good weapon. It has, I believe,
[12424.94s -> 12463.00s]  A scaling, which, you know what I mean? I got grounded because you cursed. Well, put me on
[12463.00s -> 12480.60s]  speaker. Am I on speaker? Let me know when I'm on your speakers. Okay. Hey, ma, I'm really
[12480.60s -> 12484.92s]  sorry about the cursing there that I got a little too intense, a little too worked up.
[12485.56s -> 12491.72s]  Just want to make sure that you understand that I typically run a PG-13 stream and
[12492.68s -> 12499.00s]  sometimes an F word or one of those other bad words slip out sometimes. I really am
[12499.00s -> 12508.68s]  sorry about that. Please, please let your son still watch my stream. I promise I'll never say
[12508.68s -> 12519.43s]  any bad words ever again. I need his money. I need his money. No, I don't. Don't take me
[12519.43s -> 12534.65s]  out of context there. I need his money. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I
[12534.65s -> 12544.60s]  remember this part. They all come at you on the bridge. Damn! Shut up. Everybody shut up.
[12544.60s -> 12557.14s]  We're fine. I just found a secret. What's that noise? It's getting louder. What is that noise?
[12557.14s -> 12593.70s]  Why is there silent hill sounds? Yeah, I'm gonna do the same. Yeah, same to you. Hey, dummies.
[12593.70s -> 12605.78s]  Morn's ring. I'll take the free shit. Braille divine tomb of karm. Boosts and miracles.
[12608.28s -> 12630.41s]  Grounded. I'm sorry. Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. I'm sorry, ma'am. Great corv inside. That's a rare
[12630.41s -> 12643.38s]  drop. That's a rare like 85% drop. Where? Where is he? I gotta get up. Is there two of them?
[12644.81s -> 12660.17s]  There are two here. Where is he? Oh, no, I'm facing the wrong fucking direction.
[12663.93s -> 12682.66s]  Listen, ma'am, sometimes you say the F word. It's just the F word. It's not a big deal.
[12683.78s -> 12690.18s]  Yeah, I'm not one of those like disgusting streamers that says we grow stuff,
[12690.74s -> 12704.89s]  mean stuff. I don't say like bad, mean shit. I don't want to be like that. Sometimes I say
[12705.61s -> 12728.42s]  F-U-C-K and even spelling it was embarrassing for me. I'm sorry. Too many noises.
[12728.42s -> 12741.83s]  There's too many noises. But there's an item over here. What? Where am I? I'm stuck in the
[12741.83s -> 12747.66s]  wall. I'm stuck in the wall. How do I do this? I have to do something drastic.
[12758.14s -> 12771.46s]  You're too nice, you piece of re. Well, at least the souls will be on the bridge. Going right. I
[12771.46s -> 12787.22s]  got the ember. Embers are so important because it's a full heal. Can you slap yourself again
[12787.22s -> 12803.10s]  for a joke? No, I'm a PG-13 streamer. Where are the souls? Oh, they're over there. Alright,
[12803.10s -> 12810.20s]  now should I do the speedrun strat, which is make guy jump off cliff and then grab sword.
[12810.20s -> 12826.18s]  I've seen that speedrun a few times. Let's take a look. This is C scaling. It needs 16
[12826.18s -> 12834.28s]  strength. Great Corbin side. This is the bleeding one. Someone watches AGDQ.
[12835.96s -> 12842.12s]  Well, actually there was a time when I was watching a lot of Dark Souls streamers that
[12842.12s -> 12845.88s]  did speedruns because I thought it was interesting because it just is. These games
[12845.88s -> 12855.91s]  are very hard and very particular. Now this thing is not very good. 16 strength, 18, 97
[12855.91s -> 12872.01s]  plus 29. I mean the goddamn whip is cooler. No one cares. No one cares. What? No one cares
[12872.01s -> 12881.46s]  about what? About Dark Souls? You wouldn't go to a drive-thru. Pull up to the drive-thru.
[12882.10s -> 12889.75s]  Hey, can I help you? And no one cares. Do you want food or what are you doing here?
[12899.32s -> 12903.96s]  One guy strikes again. It's one guy. No one cares. It's one guy. Alright, let's put on the
[12906.25s -> 12911.99s]  uh, I mean I could kill these two, but isn't this like killing the guy that praises the
[12911.99s -> 12919.74s]  sun? Everyone gets mad. Oh, hello. How do you do? I am Anri of Astora, unkindled like you.
[12921.16s -> 12925.88s]  This is Horace, a friend and traveling companion. Are you too in search of the
[12925.88s -> 12929.40s]  Lords of Cinder? We are well along beyond the floor. We seek that you may go off the
[12929.40s -> 12943.83s]  next time made of flames. No one cares, lady. Well, I got the souls. Attack her and then
[12943.83s -> 12951.86s]  fall off and let the guy jump up and kill himself, right? Do I have enough for a level up?
[12951.86s -> 12969.98s]  It's possible. The real wife. I'm not saying that word. The real wife is the blacksmith.
[12975.80s -> 12984.82s]  Alright, now I can use the spear. It's time to see what this thing is capable of. I've
[12984.82s -> 12993.45s]  never used it before. Let's see with the shield. How does it work with the shield? Nice.
[12993.53s -> 13016.68s]  R2. I kind of like it. Say it. I'm not going to say that. Why not? Because I don't want to say it.
[13018.62s -> 13026.89s]  Say it, idiot. Look, you wouldn't go to a drive-thru at McDonald's and order a number one
[13026.89s -> 13030.01s]  and when the guy says, is there anything else I can help you with? Say waifu.
[13031.29s -> 13034.09s]  Sir, I'm not. Sir, please pull your car up. For the love of God.
[13049.18s -> 13052.62s]  Oh, I thought I was far enough away to do the waifu joke.
[13054.25s -> 13064.90s]  Sir, you can be very far away. I severely underestimate this. The depth is so hard
[13064.90s -> 13069.98s]  to judge here. Hold on. Look at that. Does it look like I could hit that from here?
[13069.98s -> 13085.93s]  It doesn't, does it? I can't. But look it. You can. Alright, let's go. Let's go get
[13085.93s -> 13098.04s]  Abyss Watchers and let's first buy the Abyss Watchers. This weapon is terrible.
[13099.80s -> 13105.78s]  Hurry up and do something funny, clown idiot streamer.
[13106.42s -> 13115.32s]  They have bigger spears, it's not fair. Why do you guys have to be so mean, okay?
[13119.05s -> 13133.96s]  How much of that can I block? Judging how far away these guys are is absolutely- you know
[13133.96s -> 13138.92s]  it's hell. This is hell. Right? How many times have you heard me say that in this stream?
[13139.88s -> 13153.90s]  Dude, this is hell. I might as well just do that. I didn't even need to heal. I know
[13153.90s -> 13169.16s]  where to go. Me and my fucking candy stick. What a great setup I have. A shield and a
[13169.16s -> 13182.47s]  fucking street sausage. No, I know where to go. I know where to go. Don't worry.
[13183.19s -> 13205.62s]  Ah, he's behind me! I need to get that other shard from the first area.
[13208.18s -> 13239.03s]  Shove it. Did he ever put his armor back on? Watchers are this way. Don't- I'm not going
[13239.03s -> 13241.59s]  to worry about the crabs right now. I'm just going to get to the other bonfire.
[13242.47s -> 13253.32s]  Shove it. One of the things I don't like about the Dark Souls games is this is going to be a
[13253.32s -> 13258.44s]  what the heck moment for the PG-13 audience here. What the heck? Why do they get invincibility
[13258.44s -> 13274.36s]  frames sometimes when they get up from the ground? I don't get those. No, I don't. Not
[13274.36s -> 13278.68s]  as many as they do. They get like 10 frames. I get fucking four. Now this is a mistake
[13278.68s -> 13293.00s]  because I need to- you idiots. Not you guys. I'm talking about the- I missed the fucking bonfire.
[13303.30s -> 13305.70s]  It's right here, right? Somewhere right here? Where is it? It's like right here.
[13306.50s -> 13310.92s]  Where's that bonfire? I know it's right here somewhere.
[13315.16s -> 13336.17s]  What? It was up on the cliff. It's all right. I'll get there. Your mom said that you're
[13336.17s -> 13365.26s]  smart. Yeah, I bet you are. Dogs. That's a big shield. I might like that.
[13365.90s -> 13395.53s]  Jeremy, next mod please. A different mod. Look, I really don't want to bring up like any
[13395.53s -> 13399.61s]  controversy here, but you wouldn't go to McDonald's and ask for a whopper at the
[13399.61s -> 13405.40s]  fucking drive-thru. Hey, welcome to McDonald's. Can I help you? Yeah, can I get a whopper
[13405.40s -> 13432.81s]  please? Idiot clown. Stop with the McDonald's. All right, let's go Crystal Sage. You versus
[13432.81s -> 13440.28s]  me. You know, one-on-one battle. I'll come back and get these items in like a year.
[13440.28s -> 13456.47s]  Don't worry. I can't wait to hear the first line that she says.
[13461.02s -> 13496.92s]  This is gonna be horrible. This already sucks because I can't see where anything is.
[13498.86s -> 13504.90s]  Oh, I'm gonna die here. This is gonna be rough. I might have to put the other weapon on.
[13521.06s -> 13560.52s]  No. Here come the clones. Oh, what the heck? Oh my goodness. They're aiming from every
[13560.52s -> 13577.05s]  direction. Which one's the real one? Come on, give me a good roll here.
[13578.97s -> 13617.13s]  That's not the right one. Hit the ember. Dick, you're in such a weird spot.
[13632.02s -> 13643.77s]  Normally he just wants himself dumb, right guys? Don't get greedy. Just one hit and he's dead.
[13655.51s -> 13662.47s]  Oh, what the fuck happened? No, the first person camera was not in the right spot and it was one
[13662.47s -> 13675.14s]  hit. What the fuck was that? No way. I just like wasn't in the right spot.
[13677.40s -> 13679.40s]  You've got to be kidding me. That was dumb.
[13683.98s -> 13694.76s]  No, give me a fucking break. I can't even. Oh, you all know what I'm trying to say.
[13695.80s -> 13705.50s]  Classic YouTube reaction. It's over now. Oh my god, that hurt my whole fucking body.
[13705.50s -> 13712.23s]  I can't believe it. I actually can't believe it. It was that simple. I didn't get greedy on
[13712.23s -> 13717.51s]  the last time before he went down and the second time I just completely missed somehow.
[13718.15s -> 13721.03s]  I'm fucking deleting that weapon. That weapon's going in the garbage.
[13721.83s -> 13727.11s]  Lost to the crystal sage with a fucking ember. No, but it doesn't count because
[13727.11s -> 13747.69s]  it's extra hard mode because it's- ahhh! This thing sucks too. I can't believe it.
[13748.25s -> 13754.50s]  I'm infuriated right now. That's unbelievable to me. How could I let that happen?
[13756.42s -> 13768.25s]  I just like upgraded all of this. It was so- I was already there.
[13770.09s -> 13774.41s]  Somehow I wasn't lined up correctly because you can't lock on. Get that-
[13775.21s -> 13804.92s]  Mmm. Next to you. Go on, do it. Shoot it.
[13809.51s -> 13814.79s]  I just love how it doesn't matter what direction I'm facing something here.
[13818.46s -> 13824.07s]  My mom says I can't watch Family Guy. Well, that's all right. Family Guy has been awful
[13824.07s -> 13840.73s]  since like season 7. Who cares? You can see where they're fighting me from.
[13841.45s -> 13849.72s]  I can't fucking believe this. I did it and I'm just so hyper tilted right now in that first
[13849.72s -> 13865.40s]  run. I'm upgrading this thing. Can I even? The Watchers is not even gonna be as hard as this
[13865.40s -> 13871.72s]  because I only get to see in front of me so I can't- like when the blue- when the blue
[13871.72s -> 13878.25s]  diamond shooters come up, I don't even know where they're shooting from. This is plus one.
[13878.25s -> 13899.98s]  I'm just gonna upgrade this like three fucking times. Unbelievable. The Watchers aren't gonna
[13899.98s -> 13925.18s]  destroy me. All right. Plus two, plus three. I don't have enough. I got plus one. Plus two.
[13930.55s -> 13942.94s]  And I am also gonna go get the- the Estus. Which one is it? This one? Is it tower or is
[13942.94s -> 13961.18s]  it high wall? Where the shard is. Didn't he stream this before? Yeah, I did. But not with the
[13962.46s -> 13972.63s]  not wearing cinder blocks all over my body. All right, down from here. I don't remember
[13972.63s -> 13999.02s]  where it is. I think it's down. This guy blows up the room. How are you still alive?
[13999.74s -> 14006.94s]  Didn't I just upgrade this thing twice? Huh? What are you still doing here? What are you doing?
[14007.98s -> 14028.74s]  Throw the thing. Focus streamer goes the wrong fucking way. Sorry, I got the mail breaker which
[14028.74s -> 14043.21s]  I'm not gonna put on. God. It's because the weapons suck. I care too much about worrying
[14044.23s -> 14050.89s]  about the first person shit and I ended up using a bad weapon. Bad character. It doesn't matter.
[14050.89s -> 14059.13s]  I'm not going to use that as an excuse. Just give me my Estus. I didn't go the right way.
[14063.43s -> 14092.14s]  Bad gamer. Bad Estus. Bad- which way is it? I really don't remember where this is. All right.
[14092.14s -> 14113.38s]  Where the hell is it? It's not down that way. Should I- I know there's like another way to
[14113.38s -> 14138.34s]  go down. I just don't remember. DS3 GoPro edition. So wait, I was going the right way.
[14138.34s -> 14165.30s]  I always swing at the same time that you do. Jerma, GoPro. Stop being such a noob.
[14165.94s -> 14180.12s]  I can. I'm a noob. An upgraded piece of turd is still a turd. Yes, it is. But it's a better
[14180.12s -> 14194.30s]  turd. See, like, I thought I was facing this way. I guess not. All right, now from here
[14195.10s -> 14200.31s]  is the way to go. I think it is actually this way because I can go down through here, right?
[14202.33s -> 14235.99s]  There's a spear guy here. What the hell even hit me? Get a load of this guy. All right.
[14236.79s -> 14269.37s]  I'm sorry. That just kind of came up. Undead hunter charm. Bye. It's down there all the
[14269.37s -> 14275.54s]  way. Okay, down, down, down, down, down, down. Get down there. I don't give a shit about
[14275.54s -> 14285.66s]  anything else. Just give me the S to splash. It's right on top. It's okay. It's all right.
[14285.66s -> 14302.92s]  Everything's fine. It's all right. It's not all right. Everything's fine. Oh, no. Oh,
[14302.92s -> 14326.49s]  no. I'm freezing. Who cares? Just died. I got the thing I wanted. How many jokes
[14326.49s -> 14330.57s]  did we miss today? Well, we got a couple going here. We got McDonald's drive-through.
[14331.13s -> 14354.54s]  We got, it's been like two or three hilarious ones. I missed the drive-through joke. Do it
[14354.54s -> 14367.59s]  again. All right. I got my Estus. Who cares about a thousand cells? It's fine. Can you do a spill
[14367.59s -> 14373.99s]  joke? I'm going to spill the wine on my carpet and lose my security deposit. That sounds like
[14373.99s -> 14392.02s]  a good idea. It'd be like funny, right? Bingo. Okay. Six flasks. Good, good, good. Now I'm
[14392.02s -> 14406.97s]  ready. I'm ready to fight the crystal, whatever the, whatever the crystal knight's name
[14406.97s -> 14413.69s]  is. Who cares? When it's fun mod time. I mean, I, this, I am having fun. This is fun mod time.
[14419.91s -> 14444.90s]  Let's go. Don't block my path. I have to at least get to the watchers. I mean, Crystal Sage
[14444.90s -> 14451.62s]  is right here. Watch us right after. Like two or three hours after. You know, like four hours
[14451.62s -> 14454.34s]  after where you were at right now. And it's all right. I'm going to first try this right now.
[14454.34s -> 14458.90s]  I've got an upgraded weapon. Did somebody get in here with me? No, it's my hand. It's my third
[14458.90s -> 14484.63s]  fucking hand. What? I'm so confused. See what happened there is the purple firework was out of
[14484.63s -> 14488.07s]  my field of view. It was behind me. And what it did is it came back and hit me right in the back
[14488.07s -> 14505.30s]  of the head. Couldn't see it. First person on top of that. Three hands. Don't explain it away.
[14505.30s -> 14511.14s]  I have to, don't you understand? I have to ultra explain things three times in a row
[14511.14s -> 14516.02s]  over and over again. See what happened was a few minutes ago, what I did was I,
[14516.02s -> 14522.62s]  the first person came up was behind, the thing was behind me. So I have to explain the thing
[14522.62s -> 14536.25s]  I just did four times. Welcome to German 985's live stream. See, like right now,
[14536.25s -> 14539.69s]  I knew it. I told you it was going to happen. I already explained the thing.
[14551.08s -> 14570.54s]  Zero plus zero is zero. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Remember when I died to Crystal
[14570.54s -> 14577.40s]  Sage like 15 times in my first playthrough? Yeah, I'll be champion gun to your first try,
[14577.40s -> 14596.62s]  but I can't beat Crystal Sage. That's what I get for using a turret weapon,
[14596.62s -> 14629.40s]  but there was a reason for the turret weapon. That's not the real one. Oh my God.
[14635.26s -> 14640.54s]  Those floating gobstoppers are the reasons that cause so many problems. I can't see them right
[14640.54s -> 14665.78s]  now. It's behind me, isn't it? It's behind me. It's behind me. I'll take this one. Get
[14665.78s -> 14675.08s]  the one behind me. No, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,
[14675.08s -> 14678.12s]  don't get yourself killed for no reason. There's one behind you. You can't see him
[14678.12s -> 14698.79s]  because you're in first goddamn person. Full health. All the way over there. You've gotta
[14698.79s -> 14727.66s]  be kidding me. You said I couldn't fucking do it second try. Now that was first try with
[14727.66s -> 14735.02s]  actually upgraded weapon. I was here. I was here. Yeah. I mean, some of you were here
[14735.02s -> 14760.65s]  for this. I need some more endurance. Yeah. I need to get to 20 endurance. I just have to.
[14768.10s -> 14787.50s]  What does the Crystal Sage's body orb do? Really? Oh. It is the soul of a Crystal
[14787.50s -> 14808.22s]  Sage. It scales with magic. Just ain't gonna happen. Pop it. Let's get that endurance
[14808.22s -> 14827.69s]  up. For the Watchers, which I'm gonna first try. Hey chat, my bunny says she loves you
[14827.69s -> 14836.23s]  all. That's so sweet. It really is. Little bunny. Well, tell your bunny that we all
[14836.23s -> 14850.39s]  said hello. And look, if I can just keep having fun in first person, then fuck it,
[14850.39s -> 14854.87s]  man. Next time I'll do it again. We'll just do this again. I'm having an actual blast.
[14866.20s -> 14877.58s]  He sounds drunk. I'm on one glass of wine. I've taken in the amount of alcohol
[14878.46s -> 14895.70s]  that you get by swishing fucking Listerine in your mouth. What? Alcohol? Alcohol. Alcohol. I
[14895.70s -> 14904.84s]  have an accent. Alcohol. All right. Next person makes fun of my accent. I want them permanently
[14904.84s -> 14948.78s]  100% IP banned from my computer. What? Say coffee car? Coffee car. Coffee car. Where's
[14948.78s -> 14958.74s]  my accent from? England. I was born in England. I was raised in England and then I moved to
[14958.74s -> 14962.84s]  New York and then I moved from New York to Boston. I've since have dropped my English
[14962.84s -> 14967.48s]  accent. It comes out a little bit sometimes, but I've since dropped it. And it's weird
[14967.48s -> 14973.88s]  because when you're around a certain group of people, you take on certain parts of their
[14973.88s -> 14980.62s]  accents. So when I went to Boston, I had an English accent for a long time, but
[14980.62s -> 14984.70s]  I started to get a Boston accent because I was hanging out in Massachusetts.
[14986.86s -> 15009.10s]  I think it's time to get the shield out of here. Just weighing me down.
[15009.58s -> 15018.98s]  What's my equipment load? It's 25 out of 55. Am I technique? Am I? I don't even know what kind
[15018.98s -> 15030.41s]  of roll I'm doing right now. Am I mid rolling? Yeah, I am. I gotta get this done. Two, let's
[15030.41s -> 15058.97s]  see. 23. I'm gonna be lower than that. Am I? Maybe not. It's hard to tell. Fast roll isn't
[15058.97s -> 15073.98s]  worth it. Actually, I love fast roll. Can I not get hit by you for the first time? Oh,
[15073.98s -> 15076.54s]  all stream. Of course not, because I was speaking.
[15086.33s -> 15099.70s]  Let's get to those watchers. I can double hit some fire here. That's good.
[15114.01s -> 15118.44s]  Tell them, chat. What is it to tell me that I don't already know?
[15119.24s -> 15127.72s]  I've beat this game before. All right, this is not the right way to go to watch.
[15130.20s -> 15141.78s]  Yeah, that's right. That's true. Does anyone want to play Super Smash? Dude, where's the
[15141.78s -> 15175.83s]  friend code? Come here. Don't disappear. I just... Do you remember Maine's Duck Hunt? I don't.
[15176.47s -> 15189.72s]  I don't even know what that is. So I refresh my memory. I don't care if this backs me up.
[15189.72s -> 15217.62s]  I've beaten this game 10 times. How do I get to watchers? It's from the swamp. Oh, that's
[15217.62s -> 15224.70s]  right, right, right. You go through back here. Right. You go through Farron. Yeah, I remember.
[15225.42s -> 15232.89s]  All right, let's get it. Can some of you chatter to me quick? Can you get a couple of
[15232.89s -> 15251.21s]  let's get it in the chat? What was that? Did you hear that? You didn't just hear that, like...
[15255.69s -> 15260.73s]  There's a NPC over here somewhere. There's also an ember and a black knight, right?
[15262.33s -> 15271.13s]  From what I can't really remember. Your dad says I'm a bad influence. Well, I'm not...
[15272.17s -> 15279.91s]  My goal here is not to influence anyone. Influencing anyone. Why would I... I don't
[15279.91s -> 15290.90s]  want to influence you. Okay, there's a couple of items that I don't want to miss.
[15291.62s -> 15314.95s]  Professional Influencer. All right, I want to go... Where's the... Where's that NPC? He's up top.
[15315.83s -> 15325.03s]  So I can kill him and take his soul. Somebody's behind me and I'm stuck. No!
[15327.05s -> 15336.22s]  No! Who the fuck is this guy? I know he's... No, maybe he's in Farron, I think.
[15337.10s -> 15353.82s]  We're back out here anyways. I missed the item. Whatever. My first playthrough, I remember
[15353.82s -> 15359.34s]  trying to jump up here over and over again. Oh, have I ever seen this item?
[15360.14s -> 15384.58s]  This thing sucks. What does this have? This thing's terrible. Stabil... It has high
[15384.58s -> 15400.33s]  stability. It's a parry shield. Why wouldn't you just use a leather shield? All right,
[15400.97s -> 15409.42s]  this looks like a cookie. This is a fucking Fourth of July cookie. I don't think... I'm
[15409.42s -> 15419.19s]  not using this thing. All right, here we go. I know there are two NPCs to fight over here.
[15420.15s -> 15435.05s]  Fucking Dengus and Dungus. There's Dungus. And Dengus is right behind him.
[15438.81s -> 15450.12s]  What the fuck I was thinking there. Trying to get killed by Dengus and Dungus. This is great.
[15450.12s -> 15457.62s]  Great, great! Oh, fuck it. Who cares? I don't want anything to have anyways. Just
[15457.62s -> 15487.34s]  get the bonfire. It's right in here. No! I... What did you think would happen? I just forgot
[15487.34s -> 15492.71s]  how far the fall was. I thought it was like only a couple... I thought it was like 10 feet,
[15492.71s -> 15502.98s]  20 feet. I didn't think it was that far. Darth Vader's Screamer.
[15508.95s -> 15516.57s]  Nice fall joke. Jesus Christ. Just stop dicking around and try to win it. Stop it. You be quiet.
[15517.53s -> 15533.38s]  Yes. Yes. Be quiet. Well, I love... Okay, I love how there's a bunch of Pluto's in chat.
[15533.38s -> 15554.79s]  Everyone's like, oh my god! How come... Where's my Pluto? Get down the ladder! Does he
[15554.79s -> 15591.38s]  actually come... He comes all the way down? Where is he going? Fucking dumbass. Oh, I can't wait.
[15591.38s -> 15636.90s]  I'm gonna push you and watch you go all the way down. Okay. I got staggered to a point where I
[15636.90s -> 15646.26s]  couldn't even dodge. I couldn't move. He hit me with the club. Whatever. Raging Boomer. I'm
[15646.26s -> 15651.72s]  almost there. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I'm trying to remember how this scenario plays out.
[15651.72s -> 15662.82s]  I have to light the three towers before I can fight the Watchers, right? Oh, that sucks.
[15662.82s -> 15677.85s]  Uh, that sucks. Thanks for watching the stream. What the hell is that? Why is it... Why is this...
[15677.85s -> 15706.73s]  Why is Dingus's item there? How does it feel? I'm just gonna run. I'm gonna run and turn on the
[15706.73s -> 15714.70s]  fires. I'm not gonna fight any enemies. I don't care. I gotta get to Abyss Watchers. I'm gonna
[15714.70s -> 15722.22s]  level up HP one more time. I'm gonna equip the daggers and I'm just gonna dash. I'm gonna
[15722.22s -> 15733.96s]  bring six Estes. No, no, no. I'm gonna allocate Estes. Check this out.
[15744.47s -> 15762.62s]  Yeah, allocate Estes. You get what I'm going at here? Uh, there they are. Quick step.
[15763.58s -> 15781.86s]  Because then when these are equipped, you don't need mana to quickstep? Yeah, do it. Look.
[15782.82s -> 15791.10s]  You can dash without mana. What are you talking about? Huh. Look at the mana bar.
[15792.30s -> 15810.71s]  What? Am I gonna get banned? That seems like an exploit.
[15818.81s -> 15826.79s]  Okay, so you know the drill. You know the deal. We're gonna upgrade our HP.
[15835.80s -> 15838.52s]  You don't get eye frames. I'm not looking for eye frames. I'm just looking for traveling.
[15840.87s -> 15843.91s]  I just... I don't care about items. I just want to light the three fires.
[15845.11s -> 15850.14s]  If he does not first try this, I'm gonna go to McDonald's and I'm gonna do a McDonald's
[15850.14s -> 15856.70s]  joke. Don't do that. The whole point of that is you wouldn't do that.
[15858.10s -> 15899.40s]  All right. Fire number one. Over there. Let's go. I just swallowed on my own spit. I'm sorry.
[15899.96s -> 15900.60s]  I was gonna do...
[15910.89s -> 15914.25s]  Where's the other one?
[15916.73s -> 15919.30s]  Oh, yikes!
[15920.95s -> 15924.81s]  Don't... Just stop trying to be fucking funny instead of what you're gonna do.
[15924.81s -> 15940.47s]  Where's the other one? One, two, three. One, two, three. He's still here.
[15949.38s -> 15972.33s]  I can get one item. The greatsword. I ain't fucking around here, but I can get one item.
[16002.14s -> 16007.67s]  Running is faster. Watch out for the slugs. Estes Shard. You didn't think I was gonna get
[16007.67s -> 16030.60s]  the Estes Shard? You don't think I've ever played this game? Get it. Four hours and
[16030.60s -> 16046.30s]  30 minutes on one mod, but it's a good one. One more and then that is the last one.
[16050.30s -> 16054.60s]  Right there. Come on. Straight ahead. Go, go, go, go, go, go. One item. Just one.
[16055.24s -> 16085.43s]  If you can guess this song, you win. Somebody... Ghostbusters. Holy shit. Wow. Nice job.
[16088.22s -> 16098.55s]  Wow. You guys are smarter than your average bear. All right. So this next one is straight.
[16098.55s -> 16108.55s]  Just straight, straight, straight, straight. This guy made fun of Fortnite? When did I make fun
[16108.55s -> 16151.43s]  of Fortnite? Did I make fun? What? I'm trying to remember. It's not a backstab. It's a backstab
[16151.43s -> 16183.03s]  in every other fucking game I've ever played. Where's the last fire? Ah, that's not a backstab.
[16183.03s -> 16209.59s]  Somebody tell me why. Cracked, cracked peppercorn. It's up there, right? I lost it.
[16216.01s -> 16229.21s]  It is up there, isn't it? I get a better view. He's in one of his moods? Yeah, the mood is I
[16229.21s -> 16239.91s]  have to get to the Abyss Watchers. It's not this. It's over there. Are you going to beat
[16239.91s -> 16250.46s]  Medir in first person? I don't think I'm going to get to Medir in first person. I hate to say it.
[16255.32s -> 16257.96s]  All right. Last one. And then the door opens and we get to Abyss Watchers and I can beat
[16257.96s -> 16275.56s]  them first try. Fuck the item. I'll get it later. Can you Venmo me $420? I don't. I don't
[16275.56s -> 16306.50s]  have that. I don't have that money. Cheapskate asshole. All right. Here we go. You guys
[16306.50s -> 16322.36s]  ready? Ready for the Abyss Watchers? I am and I'll prove it to you. Wait, I got to do something
[16322.36s -> 16333.40s]  cool here. I'm going to go in a different door. Watch this. Come on, do it before I get killed.
[16334.20s -> 16341.42s]  I mean, I didn't get it, but I'm just trying to get the spin. Just give me the item.
[16346.04s -> 16350.92s]  That is a bone shard. Very important to have it. And in fact, I'm going to go use it right
[16350.92s -> 16364.20s]  now because it's important. Some people are saying die to slugs, but that didn't happen.
[16364.20s -> 16381.90s]  I did not die to slugs because I'm still alive. This weapon sucks. Total asshole.
[16382.62s -> 16385.53s]  And it's going to be the reason why I can't beat Abyss Watchers first try,
[16385.53s -> 16403.77s]  but I'm going to beat them first try. I need, what do I need? I don't have enough.
[16413.30s -> 16417.70s]  Died to one tin wheel, two dingus, three slugs, four Abyss Watchers. That hasn't happened yet.
[16418.66s -> 16445.56s]  We're in the bone shard. All right. This is the streamer that's overleveled and underskilled.
[16445.56s -> 16460.98s]  You can't die to a bonfire. What level am I? 30? And I'm probably underleveled right now because
[16460.98s -> 16474.28s]  I'm skipping all this content. Level 30 for Abyss Watchers. That's under. Yeah, don't die.
[16474.28s -> 16478.60s]  Don't tell me I'm underleveled when I'm, I mean, don't tell me I'm overleveled when I'm
[16478.60s -> 16510.78s]  underleveled. You're making me look bad. Where the fuck am I going? I'm, I'm telling, uh,
[16511.74s -> 16531.96s]  the Abyss Watchers are not over here. What is this? A golden scroll? I'm so close to being fucking
[16531.96s -> 16571.05s]  petrified. I didn't even go the right way. Did I go the wrong way? Good thing this is not Dark
[16571.05s -> 16583.02s]  Souls 1. Does the first person mod exist for Dark Souls 1? That would be very hard. I can't
[16583.02s -> 16588.79s]  imagine playing that game on first person. One of these guys dropped a nice weapon though,
[16588.79s -> 16613.45s]  don't they? From what I remember. I think it's a little further up. What has actually come good?
[16614.41s -> 16620.04s]  Just get out of my screen for one second. I just, all I see are fucking feathers flying around
[16620.04s -> 16653.93s]  in my hands. He's died once to every enemy? That's not true. That actually might be true.
[16653.93s -> 16679.93s]  Is that actually true? Just, I'm just gonna go. I thought it was nuts right here.
[16679.93s -> 16693.75s]  Right? There's some other shit in here, isn't there? There's a bonfire here. Fuck, I'm hungry,
[16693.75s -> 16695.91s]  but I had dinner three hours ago. That's all right, just eat again.
[16697.67s -> 16711.80s]  There's a black knight over here, isn't there? Who cares? What's wrong with that? That's all
[16711.80s -> 16720.58s]  right. Just don't, just have like a snack. Have a little snack. Popcorn, a little bit
[16720.58s -> 16730.81s]  of butter on it. Cheese and crackers. That's a high calorie. You're fine. Yeah, these guys
[16730.81s -> 16737.83s]  dropped a golden sword. Well, I can't even, forget it. Let's just go to the watchers and
[16737.83s -> 16761.66s]  win first try. This looks cool in first person. Look at this area. All right, here we go. Let's
[16761.66s -> 16806.97s]  give it a whirl. There we go. That wasn't fair. Now fight each other. Fight me instead.
[16807.61s -> 16812.54s]  Why are you not fighting each other? Fight him. You're making this too hard for me.
[16813.10s -> 16838.28s]  Will you fight him? Oh, this is my friend over here. Right, okay. Judges so hard. I don't even
[16838.28s -> 16842.28s]  know which one is which now. The perspective has got me all fucked up. I don't even know
[16842.28s -> 16855.32s]  who's the real one. This is definitely not going to happen first try. It's impossible
[16855.32s -> 16867.03s]  first try. I'm doing 97 damage a swing. Is this the worst weapon in the entire game?
[16867.03s -> 16889.66s]  It could be. It's possible. You're the worst weapon in the game. I'm not even going to
[16889.66s -> 16903.51s]  get into this second phase. Maybe I will. Well, didn't see you there. Tunnel vision.
[16904.39s -> 16927.94s]  Jerma, don't spoil what happened. It's the third worst halberd, but it has a good sweet spot.
[16928.58s -> 16942.92s]  I'm so concerned about this. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You
[16942.92s -> 16947.96s]  guys don't understand. I didn't have a weapon with big reach because depth perception is
[16947.96s -> 16967.32s]  hard with the first person. I can't. I'm literally going to burn this weapon in the trash.
[16968.52s -> 16976.73s]  It takes too long to swing for 110 damage. It's awful. Just kill me. I'm going to fucking
[16976.73s -> 17026.57s]  burn this on screen. Where's the cool ice sword? I told you long sword was the way to
[17026.57s -> 17065.72s]  go. Ice sword is the way to go. Back to zone. Here we go. Camera man, it just is.
[17066.68s -> 17069.64s]  They move too fast for me to hold right stick in a direction.
[17079.26s -> 17084.30s]  You can't lock on to anybody. So I have to hold right stick to see where he is.
[17085.10s -> 17095.53s]  Holy shit. I don't know what's happening right now. I'm going to do it. I'm going to win.
[17096.17s -> 17133.08s]  Christ. He's spoiled with lock on. Insane. If the lock on stayed locked on, right? So when
[17133.08s -> 17138.76s]  you dodge roll, right? When you dodge roll in Dark Souls and you have a lock on, the camera
[17139.24s -> 17148.62s]  is always focusing on the enemy that you have locked on. Not here. See here, if you do a dodge
[17148.62s -> 17161.72s]  roll, the enemy is gone. Good luck. Turning the sensitivity up. No, that would be horrible
[17161.72s -> 17167.80s]  because it would be like, I would throw up. I think the sensitivity is fine. I'll get it.
[17168.60s -> 17184.84s]  I'm going to be slow and wait for the opportunity and it's happening.
[17195.46s -> 17204.07s]  Just judging the distance. It's like juggling oranges while playing Dark Souls.
[17220.12s -> 17250.63s]  I'm going to go with the cookie shield because this will make me want to win. How many bosses
[17250.63s -> 17255.78s]  have I beaten in first person? I've only played the game in first person. Only. So the whole game
[17255.78s -> 17292.78s]  so far. I just do some testing. I got to do some testing first. Yikes. Where did you come
[17292.78s -> 17346.28s]  from? No. I'm too far away. Where the fuck did he go? Oh my God. This is going to take
[17346.28s -> 17356.60s]  like a hundred tries to do this. I need to upgrade this thing. I will do this before the stream is
[17356.60s -> 17385.96s]  over. Goodness. No, why am I locked onto that guy? What the hell is that for? Holy shit.
[17390.25s -> 17395.43s]  I'm getting attacked from behind now. Come on. Come on first person. Suck my bum.
[17408.15s -> 17427.59s]  Get out of the way. Move. Turn. I have, I might get him to the second phase.
[17429.08s -> 17440.71s]  It's very possible. My God. Just give me the second phase and let me just see what it looks
[17440.71s -> 17449.13s]  like in first person. I just want to see. I just want to see. I just, okay. I just want to see
[17449.13s -> 17469.64s]  what it looks like. Here we go. I can't get hit one time. Holy shit. Trying to gauge the
[17469.64s -> 17490.15s]  distance of these moves. No way. Not in a million years. It's not over. Suck my bum.
[17491.05s -> 17510.49s]  Not you guys. I'm not throwing the towel in that easily. How do I fix this? I don't even
[17510.49s -> 17530.42s]  have enough souls to do this. What weapon do I have? It might have to be. Use mouse and
[17530.42s -> 17536.79s]  keyboard? I'll show you what happens when you use mouse and keyboard. This. As you can see,
[17536.79s -> 17543.66s]  this is not, this is not ideal at all. Although it seems cool. For some reason the
[17543.66s -> 17548.06s]  mod cannot handle a mouse input like this because it's changing the camera so rapidly
[17551.42s -> 17559.16s]  that it's very headache inducing. Uh, I could probably upgrade this weapon.
[17560.12s -> 17571.93s]  Let me see. I don't have any souls but I can sell some stuff. So this requires, I could
[17571.93s -> 17587.11s]  upgrade this once with a titanite. Twinkling titanite. Either that or I need a few more
[17587.11s -> 17602.14s]  shards to get this to plus three. I'll upgrade this once because this is a good, this is a
[17602.14s -> 17612.20s]  good weapon just to have. Promises of other mods. I have to beat Abyss Watchers first before
[17612.20s -> 17619.34s]  we do anything else. First person. Plus the title of the stream is First Person Dark Souls
[17619.34s -> 17637.22s]  3 so. Okay, I'm gonna upgrade this once. I need, how many souls do I need to do this?
[17640.76s -> 17654.42s]  Five thirty. It's easy. Sell. Uh, sell the stupid home, home brood that he made. Sell
[17654.42s -> 17662.44s]  these dumb alien beads, whatever they are. I could put one of these on too. Can you put,
[17662.44s -> 17678.92s]  can I put fire and ice? I don't think I can. That's enough. That would be 138 plus 26.
[17680.04s -> 17688.01s]  Let's give it a go. One more level and it turns into a C for strength scaling.
[17688.01s -> 17715.27s]  I'm gonna give this to the bird. Okay, let's try it again. I'm ready. I'm going to win.
[17715.27s -> 17732.23s]  It's gonna happen. Just give me your energy. No, why not? Can I get this stupid shield off
[17732.23s -> 17739.80s]  and put something else useful on? This thing is really good. Let me see, it's a hundred
[17739.80s -> 17754.14s]  percent block. That might not be good though. What is that little guy, the energy guy?
[17755.66s -> 17775.80s]  Is that Kirby? What character is that? Okay, focus. Let's go. Upgraded the weapon.
[17776.84s -> 17790.44s]  Here we are. Have I lost my mind or is this doing less damage?
[17793.27s -> 17833.26s]  What? It's not my head. It got worse. You and me. You, me and you, me and you, me and me.
[17834.06s -> 17849.26s]  I didn't expect you to. Oh crap, oh crap. I'm about to settle down. Did you change hands?
[17852.86s -> 17882.33s]  The smoke, the smoke is, they're smoking me out here. Get back here. Where is it? Where's
[17882.33s -> 17892.36s]  the other guy? Where is he? Is he dead? No, he's up here. Let's do it. Florestus,
[17892.36s -> 17910.71s]  come on. Let's do it. I'm ready. All right, I'm gonna gauge some distance here.
[17911.67s -> 17941.58s]  I don't need to do the fire thing. Oh shit. Wow. It's so hard. It's so hard.
[17942.54s -> 17965.24s]  It is so hard to do this in first person. It's so hard. I want my energy back now.
[17965.24s -> 17972.95s]  It's mine. It's mine and I got to the first, I'm getting better. I'm doing things better.
[17973.75s -> 18015.98s]  Everything's just fine. Shit. Fucking first person. I've ruined the character build too. It's all my
[18015.98s -> 18025.98s]  own fault. I would be doing probably twice as much damage if I didn't put three upgrades
[18025.98s -> 18099.32s]  into the fucking wood long pole thing. I could just raw gem the looser. No, you're right.
[18100.20s -> 18122.63s]  No, they're behind me. I will tell you, having to press R3 every five seconds
[18123.43s -> 18160.98s]  is like mind-meltingly frustrating. No. They're right next to me, aren't they?
[18163.62s -> 18189.30s]  So here's the thing. Everyone's saying do a new mod. We're at the ultimate wall. I have to
[18189.30s -> 18194.60s]  beat this first. You want me to do this in times 10 speed? That's not going to happen.
[18195.64s -> 18217.14s]  There's no way. Okay, let me, what would I get if I raw gemmed the lucerne? Turn them all on at
[18217.14s -> 18229.90s]  the same time? I can do this. I just need to get the right amount of damage. 136 plus 62,
[18232.20s -> 18245.08s]  202. Okay, I'm going to raw gem this. I'm going to raw gem the lucerne. We're going
[18245.08s -> 18253.18s]  to give it a go. We're going back to turd. I need 2250 souls. We're just selling my whole inventory.
[18253.90s -> 18269.32s]  What the hell is even in here? That doesn't matter.
[18272.20s -> 18280.49s]  Doesn't matter. Infuse. Where is it? What am I at right now?
[18283.00s -> 18288.44s]  151 plus 39. This would make this a 202. That's as good as I'm going to get.
[18290.68s -> 18323.70s]  Doing it. Let's go. Now I'm going to win. Plus three damage. What do I got? 22. How's my roll?
[18324.90s -> 18335.14s]  Let's go. And what else do we got here? Can I put, can I use this shit? Does this actually
[18335.14s -> 18344.33s]  work? I can actually light this on fire. I'll be ready. Not that one. Where is it?
[18345.13s -> 18351.11s]  I don't think I have any gold pine. No, I don't have any gold pine.
[18351.83s -> 18360.57s]  He just copied their weapons. Well, sometimes you have to copy to win.
[18364.73s -> 18368.25s]  24 hour stream? I don't think so, but I'm still having a good time. So
[18369.05s -> 18401.22s]  I'm going to keep going. It's better than it was before. Damn it. Here he comes.
[18411.13s -> 18419.42s]  Holy shit. That guy almost killed me in one hit. It doesn't help that I'm under leveled too.
[18420.70s -> 18425.30s]  I need, I'm like under leveled by like probably at least five to 10 levels for this.
[18426.34s -> 18439.61s]  All right. If I don't do it this time, then I'm going to, I'll turn.
[18440.49s -> 18447.38s]  Cause this is just, this is just literal pain. Under leveled first person mod. I may as well just
[18447.38s -> 18485.30s]  fucking, I honestly may as well just go to sleep on the screen. Oh, with a backswing.
[18486.02s -> 18497.91s]  You're stuck in like the fog. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Oh,
[18498.71s -> 18550.66s]  okay. I got an opportunity here. One shot. Let's go. Fucking camera. What are you doing
[18550.66s -> 18593.77s]  to me? No, the camera is off him again. It's so frustrating. I just want to lock onto him and
[18593.77s -> 18612.73s]  it just takes it off every fucking time. Oh my God. It's unbearable. Cause every time I turn
[18612.73s -> 18617.37s]  the camera, like it's face, it faces the direction you move, right? So if I have him
[18617.37s -> 18632.74s]  locked on and I dodge this way, he's gone. Even if I'm locked on. Ooh, it hurts. No,
[18632.74s -> 18644.30s]  I got him close. I can do this. Take it out of first person. That defeats the whole
[18644.30s -> 18682.36s]  purpose of this whole stream. Summon ghosts. No, I can't do that. I got him halfway. I'll get it.
[18683.64s -> 18711.86s]  This is definitely the wall dog. I have to at least beat this. How many times? I'm probably,
[18711.86s -> 18722.57s]  I'll die another 30 times. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna, I'm wearing the weights and I'm
[18722.57s -> 18739.50s]  running the mile. Don't worry. We're going to go to funny mods after I beat them. It has
[18739.50s -> 18744.06s]  to happen. We're going to transition to funny LOL mods, but I'm going to beat them right
[18744.06s -> 18783.99s]  now. I can't break out. Cheers to you yet. Cheers to you is a desperate scenario. I'm
[18783.99s -> 18804.62s]  not desperate yet because I did bring them to about 50%. Let's get bit by a mosquito.
[18805.18s -> 18827.21s]  Here we go. The lock on that's killing me. Put the lock on on them and you just,
[18827.21s -> 18831.61s]  you've played hundreds of hours of Dark Souls and you just expect that when you dodge
[18831.61s -> 18836.17s]  or you move, it's going to keep them in focus and just doesn't do it. And the idea
[18836.17s -> 18846.97s]  that thousands of times you've died in Dark Souls, it's not going to happen. Don't,
[18846.97s -> 18864.73s]  not with that attitude. Unplug the key, the unplug the controller and do mouse and keyboard.
[18864.73s -> 18871.19s]  I mean, that's a, I'll try it, but I'm so used to playing this game without a mouse.
[18873.29s -> 18876.33s]  This is the one right here. I'm not, I don't need a mouse. I don't need an extra
[18876.33s -> 18882.54s]  support. I'm going to do this on my own because I know that I can. You understand?
[18883.18s -> 18901.16s]  One, two, three, action. Fair. That's not fair. It's it. I can't do it when it's not fair.
[18901.96s -> 18912.26s]  This is, you can't, you can't do it when it's unfair, you know, when you got an unfair
[18912.26s -> 18931.14s]  scenario. Jesus Christ. I'm going to do it. Oh, is that, you know, it's actually kind
[18931.14s -> 18937.50s]  of refreshing. I'll tell you why. Uh, so like seven months ago, I opened up Dark Souls
[18937.50s -> 18940.38s]  three for fun and I was like, you know, I'll play through Dark Souls three again. That
[18940.38s -> 18946.47s]  sounds like a good idea. Uh, I think I died probably three times. I beat the Abyss Watch's
[18946.47s -> 18949.59s]  first try. It was just like, all right, this is just what I'm doing. This is fun.
[18949.59s -> 18954.31s]  I know how to like dodge here. It's actually kind of refreshing to lose over and over
[18954.31s -> 18959.11s]  again in a game that I've played through at least five times. It's really cool.
[18960.31s -> 18971.13s]  This actually is very interesting. It's refreshing. I'm like frustrated again at
[18971.21s -> 18987.11s]  Abyss Watchers. When was the last time you heard that? It was the other guy. There he is.
[19002.02s -> 19008.10s]  This really breeds new life. I'm just going to run away. You're just being really annoying.
[19008.66s -> 19020.98s]  All right, go in. I'm fighting the wrong guy. You're supposed to fight your brothers.
[19029.42s -> 19041.62s]  What the hell just happened? I thought you were further away.
[19043.82s -> 19047.74s]  Bad angle. Very bad angle. Where's the other one?
[19049.26s -> 19066.52s]  Distance man. It's going to kill me every time.
[19066.52s -> 19095.56s]  Okay. All right. Come on, bring it on. Let's go. Go fight him. Fight him. Fight him. Hit him.
[19095.56s -> 19115.85s]  Hit him again. Hit him again. Good. Let's go. Glass of wine. Come on. Be gentle. Be easy.
[19115.85s -> 19122.84s]  It's going to take a little while, but you'll get it. It's okay. All I need is one.
[19123.64s -> 19149.61s]  The effects on the screen. Good luck. Jesus, man. You just saw in real time there.
[19150.25s -> 19181.22s]  I didn't even do anything. You saw in real time how impossible that is. It's desperate.
[19181.22s -> 19195.08s]  What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you.
[19196.71s -> 19203.66s]  Acknowledging you for a variety of reasons. I can do this. If there's a situation that
[19203.66s -> 19217.05s]  does not apply to you, just listen and see how you feel. So sit back, get ready. Here it
[19217.05s -> 19223.43s]  comes. I can only use this once every couple of years because I'm absolutely guaranteed we'll
[19223.43s -> 19234.79s]  win. We want to thank you for all your hard work. Then he steps up and gets things done
[19234.79s -> 19250.73s]  around him. Deliver what you promise and then you go the extra mile. You're doing a great job.
[19251.37s -> 19264.78s]  A great job. If anyone asks, we'll tell them. A great job.
[19298.70s -> 19301.18s]  Come on. Cheer me on. Cheer me on. I can't do without you.
[19301.90s -> 19330.07s]  Where is he? I need him right now so bad. Ask him here today. We want to tell you that
[19330.07s -> 19340.04s]  we have faith in you and we know you can do it. We know you've got everything it takes
[19340.04s -> 19349.08s]  to accomplish whatever your heart desires. That dream you're going for. That career you want.
[19349.72s -> 19360.76s]  That recognition you're seeking. It is yours. Just listen. Everyone agrees.
[19365.00s -> 19370.36s]  You're on your side. Who's on my side? Who is? We believe in you.
[19371.16s -> 19412.41s]  We believe. It's impossible. It's actually impossible. No, unplugging doesn't help either.
[19413.37s -> 19430.09s]  It's still like this fucked up. It's just like putting, it's just covering your eyes in paint.
[19431.05s -> 19435.74s]  Hey, you wanna play the game Dark Souls? Yeah, dude. It sounds like fun. First,
[19435.74s -> 19454.30s]  cover your eyes in green paint. Thank you. Thank you for believing in me.
[19455.18s -> 19458.14s]  Thank you for a million things. Seriously, thank you for believing in me. I'm gonna go
[19458.14s -> 19464.06s]  for it. For your love and your support and your persistence and your patience and your courage.
[19464.06s -> 19469.58s]  This is very real right now. When life was the craziest. When I didn't have a clue who I was.
[19470.22s -> 19477.18s]  When I kept going down the wrong road. You were always there seeing something in me that I just
[19477.18s -> 19482.94s]  couldn't see. And you never gave up hope. You never said good luck. You're on your own.
[19483.90s -> 19485.10s]  You've never done that, guys.
[19506.39s -> 19518.89s]  I just weren't cheering hard enough last time. That was the problem.
[19531.90s -> 19561.88s]  Come on, it's my friend. I'm good. What was the stagger? Come on, man.
[19568.76s -> 19572.02s]  He's got a non-LP.
[19581.30s -> 19582.26s]  I'm almost there.
[19612.25s -> 19653.13s]  It's my turn. It's my turn. It's my turn. I need my cheers.
[19671.62s -> 19681.11s]  This is always more than half full. You're smart and you're creative and you're courageous.
[19682.39s -> 19693.69s]  You tell the truth. It's too much. It's too much to handle. It's too much to do.
[19696.17s -> 19706.26s]  God damn it. Not even cheers to you is gonna make this happen. What level am I?
[19706.26s -> 19724.06s]  Fucking 30. All right. Hold on. I get to play binaural beats?
[19727.96s -> 19734.60s]  It's too much. It's so hard. You know what I mean? Fuck. But I'm so addicted right now
[19734.60s -> 19751.66s]  to beating this boss in first person. I know I can do this. I feel like I'm one of those old
[19751.66s -> 19757.50s]  school phone operators where there's like 40 calls going on and I got to unplug Mary talking
[19757.50s -> 19762.46s]  to fucking Jacob and plug her into talking to fucking Dan and then Dan is trying to call
[19762.46s -> 19773.40s]  fucking Margaret. Unplug Margaret. There's a lot of inputs. What am I even doing right now?
[19777.98s -> 19781.58s]  You have to dodge right? I can't dodge right in any Souls game. It never works.
[19784.02s -> 19787.14s]  It doesn't matter how much better it will be. I have to dodge left everywhere.
[19787.14s -> 19796.14s]  I can't dodge right. This is engraved in my brain. Forward. I can dodge forward.
[19803.50s -> 19813.58s]  What do you got? Something? Souls? Why are you fighting this guy? Because I want to like level
[19813.58s -> 19820.42s]  up again. And I even went to the desperation. I brought in the cheers to you. You know that.
[19821.88s -> 19834.60s]  Like this is a freezer moment right now. The strongest thing in the universe is cheers to you.
[19835.32s -> 19841.78s]  And it might be the weapon. No, it's not. Oh yeah. What have I done? What have I done?
[19845.80s -> 19849.24s]  I can only bring out cheers to you like once every couple of years and it works.
[19850.38s -> 19856.46s]  Not this time. This is when the arc of the story with a hero gets beat and you thought he was
[19856.46s -> 19862.06s]  gonna win. Like nobody can beat German 985. Oh yeah, no, yes they can. He got beat.
[19862.94s -> 19884.06s]  He was defeated. What are we gonna do? Now we're training for the revenge arc. That's true.
[19884.86s -> 19893.53s]  Because I've ran through this whole zone. I thought I was gonna be able to beat him
[19893.53s -> 19904.22s]  first try. What an idiotic thing to think. How stupid was that for me to say?
[19904.22s -> 19907.02s]  I'm gonna run through a whole zone and then fight the boss in first person.
[19907.90s -> 19931.35s]  What an idiotic thing to say. Where am I? Oh god. No, not these guys. Not these guys. No.
[19937.54s -> 19941.91s]  Don't curse me. I'll take poison every day of the week.
[19951.10s -> 19958.31s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. They're everywhere. I need the redemption arc.
[19959.90s -> 19964.74s]  Get a wrist watcher. I got any of your wrist watchers.
[19965.78s -> 19984.17s]  How much is one level? Like 2,500? 3,000? Jax is not. Okay, you guys have a seat.
[19984.89s -> 19989.45s]  Spoilers for Infinity War. Those of you that don't want to know about Thanos and his
[19990.01s -> 19999.78s]  great rise to, you know. Remember in that movie when the Hulk, right? Spoilers. Just turn
[19999.78s -> 20012.79s]  your fucking entire house out. Remember in Infinity War, in the Hulk, Jax is not here. I can't get
[20012.79s -> 20030.25s]  him. There is no Jax. He doesn't want to come out. We don't even have Jon. We have, we have
[20032.01s -> 20040.54s]  I don't have any flasks. I'm not gonna kill him. I've been abandoned by my inner fucking Jax.
[20041.50s -> 20060.26s]  Get me out of here. How are you still here? You fucking muppet. I didn't think he could even
[20060.26s -> 20098.84s]  come up here. Oh no, it's over. Where am I? I'm just trying to get some. I've done, I've done
[20098.84s -> 20135.72s]  a bad thing here. I've fucked it all up. What? Put your knife in my build. This whole thing is
[20135.72s -> 20140.68s]  good. I didn't have that much trouble until right now. But that's because this is where
[20140.68s -> 20151.35s]  the game actually begins to start to matter. It actually might not be a bad idea
[20152.07s -> 20156.44s]  to crystal lizard this shit and get the twinkling titanite and upgrade the fucking other weapons.
[20157.88s -> 20229.24s]  Holy shit, that was terrifying in first person. Which way do I know it? Easy, easy.
[20247.67s -> 20256.86s]  No, no, no, no. Gamer fatigue. Don't let that set in. You can't let Gamer
[20256.86s -> 20260.86s]  Fatigue set in right now. It just almost did. I can feel the energy draining from my fucking
[20260.86s -> 20311.94s]  soul. That's not even the right thing I needed. Black knight.
[20315.85s -> 20321.21s]  Fucking chest. Oh, I didn't. Please don't. I'm in the middle of my fucking montage.
[20321.93s -> 20367.16s]  Get away from me. Fucking out of here. What's going on? Die. I'm ready. No,
[20367.16s -> 20429.11s]  that's not what I want. This. Give me a black knight weapon. Game sucks. So short.
[20424.20s -> 20437.64s]  Parry the Watchers. It's it's really hard to parry in first person. Oh,
[20437.64s -> 20449.86s]  Shadowshow or Twinblade. I just did it. Yeah, but that was because I like just put a bunch of
[20449.86s -> 20476.30s]  air into my brain. I just went and just shoved a bunch of air into my brain. These are good,
[20476.30s -> 20515.30s]  right? This feels like a VR game. I'm using them. Anything else? All right,
[20515.30s -> 20542.26s]  let's go back and level up decks and these. We just had to train leveling decks. Well,
[20542.26s -> 20546.41s]  desperate times call for desperate measures and that's called. I gotta be.
[20567.61s -> 20569.13s]  Do I even have any titanite shards?
[20578.79s -> 20588.34s]  I do. I have a little bit. Okay, this is 108 plus 23. This goes from C to C. I'm doing it.
[20588.34s -> 20595.50s]  I'm going for it. I need a few more. Can I buy shards from somebody, right?
[20596.06s -> 20605.70s]  Carefully. Who sells them?
[20612.09s -> 20621.19s]  Sell everything you got. Start from scratch. I'm in first person already. Don't need them.
[20621.19s -> 20640.63s]  I need the ashes. Oh, right. But where is that first ash?
[20642.15s -> 20673.58s]  Is it in the swamp? Shit. All right, I'll be back. Like back here. There aren't any more
[20673.58s -> 20677.90s]  mods are there? I they're right here. I just I'm so obsessed with this right now.
[20677.90s -> 20691.67s]  He's a liar. There aren't actually any mods. No, it's in the poison swamp.
[20695.64s -> 20711.42s]  I assure you there are. And once I beat the abyss watchers. Like back here.
[20722.66s -> 20725.94s]  If you beat the watchers, I will. I don't care how long it takes.
[20727.22s -> 20733.26s]  I will beat the watchers. I don't care how long it takes in first person. If this is
[20733.26s -> 20745.64s]  the first ever 24 hour stream, that's what's going to happen. All right. Where the hell am I?
[20745.64s -> 20773.08s]  Where's this ash? It's not in here, is it? This is where it just came from, isn't it?
[20774.36s -> 20796.70s]  The tower in the swamp. That's the entrance. What the fuck is the tower? Tower?
[20802.01s -> 20805.37s]  Oppositely the abyss watchers. It's a huge foot west of that. I should have taken the
[20805.37s -> 20844.87s]  other bonfire then. I thought it was going to be a titanite shard. It's near that room
[20844.87s -> 20853.35s]  full of slugs. So I should have gone to the other bonfire. You're back from dinner. What
[20853.35s -> 20871.78s]  did you miss? Well, you missed a couple of rage moments. Where the hell are you?
[20872.90s -> 20881.82s]  Room with the slugs. Room with the slugs. What? This is the room with the slugs right here.
[20882.62s -> 20904.57s]  Get away from me. Diagro. Diagro from me. I demand it. Good players can beat this game
[20904.57s -> 20908.97s]  five times in the time you play today. But are they playing in first person?
[20909.85s -> 20927.16s]  What the heck are you talking about? I made it to the other bonfire, which is probably where
[20927.16s -> 20940.54s]  I should have started in the first place. Okay, so from here I need to go... not this way.
[20948.71s -> 20953.85s]  Is this fun in first person? No. I'm just kidding. Yes, it is. To the right. Wait,
[20953.85s -> 20957.69s]  wait, wait. Also, you gotta remember, when you tell me where to go, there's like a
[20957.69s -> 20961.85s]  least of five to ten second delay on the stream. So when I walk and you say go right,
[20961.85s -> 20965.61s]  I'm seeing that like ten seconds later. So you talk about like straight and right.
[20975.13s -> 21008.26s]  Go left. Like there. Where's the entrance? Don't fucking poison me. Your other left.
[21008.90s -> 21016.41s]  Where's the entrance? Oh, that's right. There is an asylum demon up here.
[21021.72s -> 21029.59s]  It was there. First person camera. It's hard to see. I thought that was just a bamboo shoot.
[21030.31s -> 21081.03s]  The wolf? I'm gonna stab him in his head. How are you supposed to get that? I can't
[21081.03s -> 21095.10s]  jump to there. How are you supposed to get that? What the? That doesn't make any sense.
[21095.66s -> 21108.62s]  I mean, I can do the tuber voice. My damn will. Please. Okay, wait, wait, wait. This
[21108.62s -> 21117.86s]  is the asylum demons up here. Let's kill this motherfucker. What do you say?
[21117.86s -> 21126.41s]  I got my double swords. Let's go. The asylum demon's not that hard, although I'll probably
[21126.41s -> 21142.20s]  die. About that he spits out meatballs. Really slow swing. This is gonna take forever,
[21142.20s -> 21181.88s]  isn't it? I think I have to run when he does that. Yes. Where am I?
[21182.04s -> 21204.09s]  Grab him. Don't die to the pinwheel demon. You guys have to understand. My field of view is so
[21204.09s -> 21231.64s]  limited. When I get that close, all I see are bird feathers. Increasing the FOV will pull it
[21231.64s -> 21237.96s]  back to a point where it looks unnatural and it looks kind of strange. Almost like you're
[21237.96s -> 21242.78s]  looking through somebody else's body. Not necessarily. Oh, these are my hands. I can
[21242.78s -> 21247.58s]  see my hands and I'm running. It's like the weird VR syndrome where my hands are floating
[21248.14s -> 21278.38s]  like 10 feet in front of my face. I'm 32, that's it. Oh, soul's gone.
[21295.93s -> 21304.58s]  Did I build the character wrong? Yeah. For a very quick explanation. Judging the distance is
[21305.54s -> 21310.90s]  extraordinarily difficult in first person. So I thought very, very brilliantly that I was
[21310.90s -> 21315.14s]  gonna use a really long spear type weapon because it would be easier to determine where
[21315.14s -> 21322.26s]  I was. Super short record scratch. That was a terrible idea because it don't even matter
[21322.26s -> 21349.75s]  anyways. What's happening in forum? Where's that wall? This is an illusory wall. I know
[21349.75s -> 21377.72s]  there is. I didn't just read that in chat. No one tell him where. You better tell me.
[21377.72s -> 21402.22s]  And there's the ash. Lonely streamer reads in quotes chat. What do you mean in quotes?
[21403.18s -> 21416.55s]  Why are you putting chat in quotes? There's a chat here. What? I have to at least beat another
[21416.55s -> 21423.93s]  bot. I'm too addicted to first person. I told you. I'm telling you. I'm saying to you. Listen
[21423.93s -> 21432.25s]  to me. Are you hearing me? Losing to the asylum demon. It's like I eternal sunshine my brain.
[21432.25s -> 21444.12s]  It's great. This is awesome. I'm so glad that I'm losing over and over again. Wake up. I don't
[21444.12s -> 21454.23s]  want to wake up. I'd rather stay asleep. How did that? I don't know. He had a fucking scientist
[21454.23s -> 21491.91s]  on it. Okay that's better. Locking on is a really awful idea. Not that shit. This hurts
[21491.91s -> 21526.49s]  him a lot. I get a bit gritty sometimes. Shit. Just didn't see it. I don't know how far that's
[21526.49s -> 21552.01s]  gonna go but far enough apparently. Give me a break. Eat the meatball. I did.
[21552.01s -> 21558.78s]  Like three times. You've been laughing just up to six hours. By this point, it's
[21558.78s -> 21570.14s]  considerably 24 ounces of water. I'm fine. I drank water on my break. I drank a whole
[21570.14s -> 21576.92s]  entire 16 ounce glass. Any of the items up here? I got the ash. I'm ready to continue
[21576.92s -> 21582.74s]  the upgrade path. Oh that's where you come in there. I remember the E3 joke.
[21582.74s -> 21590.04s]  That seems like six years ago. That was three hours ago. He's reading bot messages.
[21590.04s -> 21615.59s]  I'm just homeward boning. I don't care. All right what does the asylum demon have?
[21616.55s -> 21629.78s]  This large titanite over there? I'll get it later. Oh fuck. You can get Heval's ring.
[21629.78s -> 21674.76s]  I want it. Oh shit I don't have any more souls. I put on some real armor. After I
[21674.76s -> 21685.93s]  enforce the flask. Seven seven seven plus two. Here you go. Take the ash.
[21688.41s -> 21695.82s]  Tell her where you found it. I feel like I give a shit. All right I'm ready to upgrade.
[21697.98s -> 21702.54s]  All right seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven
[21702.62s -> 21722.15s]  plus two. Your mods are gonna ban us. What? Seven seven seven jackpot. Why is everybody
[21722.15s -> 21746.97s]  writing sevens? Chat stop giving him points. He's tricking you. I need souls because I need
[21746.97s -> 21752.78s]  to upgrade my new cool weapon that I want to use. Not this dumb not cool weapon. That's
[21752.78s -> 21756.86s]  not the one. It's these ones. All right I want my cool weapon to be upgraded. I'm a dumb one.
[21759.93s -> 21773.21s]  So I need how many souls do I need? I need 800. I need like 5,000 souls. I just had
[21773.21s -> 21786.12s]  it but I got Heval's ring because this is yep yep yep yep yep okay. I need souls.
[21787.00s -> 21803.93s]  Stop saying Heval. I have an accent. He doesn't have any mods. Do I need to activate
[21803.93s -> 21818.25s]  one of these mods just to prove that I own them? I could sell the embers but unnecessary.
[21827.00s -> 21833.34s]  Sell all of them. Now I can get like a thousand right here. These guys alone.
[21835.26s -> 21869.85s]  All right and then I'm gonna sell four embers. Who cares. I should be able to upgrade these
[21869.85s -> 21884.62s]  twice to plus three. Install a nude mod? For who? I think I have enough to do it once.
[21889.67s -> 21896.15s]  All right so this is four to get it to plus two and then I need six to get it to plus
[21896.15s -> 21938.66s]  three. You have that's eight. Okay I need I need like 7,000 souls. I don't have any joke weapons.
[21939.46s -> 21965.88s]  That's too much to sell. I don't want to sell like six embers.
[21967.56s -> 21985.14s]  Just cheat? I can't what do you mean just cheat? I'm not going to use this. I'm certain of it.
[21985.78s -> 22023.62s]  What a waste. How many souls do I need to do this one more time? I need. I got it.
[22024.74s -> 22033.85s]  All right bingo. Plus three. Let's go. It's time. I got seven estus flasks. I got a new good weapon.
[22034.81s -> 22064.76s]  No not the wolf. Who the hell is it? Which one is it? It's which which I don't even
[22064.76s -> 22070.97s]  remember where the hell I need to go. It's this one right? Yeah. Time for redemption arc.
[22071.69s -> 22087.96s]  We'll see. By the way if you're wondering you I'm doing true glasses of wine which are not even
[22088.84s -> 22093.00s]  20% of the glasses full. So you heard me pour that three times. There's not three full glasses
[22093.00s -> 22107.70s]  of wine. That's the kind of glass of wine you'll get at a restaurant. Prove it. Here we go.
[22107.70s -> 22116.98s]  Let's try it again. And then we get to turn on the funny mods at six plus hours after the
[22116.98s -> 22158.63s]  stream has been going. How much damage are we going to do now? 58. Use L1. I am doing L1.
[22158.63s -> 22204.23s]  I'm stuck in the corner and it's time to lose it. I can't move. I only leveled up one time.
[22215.54s -> 22225.21s]  New mods. New mods. New mods. You suck. If you guys knew. No not if you guys. If some of
[22225.21s -> 22252.74s]  you guys knew how hard it was to do this. Maybe you'd be a little nicer. Maybe you
[22252.74s -> 22267.27s]  wouldn't have such a mean streak. 120. It's actually not bad. Still probably could use like
[22267.27s -> 22349.53s]  another five levels. Bring them on. Let's go. Where's my friend? Fuck. It's just it's
[22349.53s -> 22361.24s]  melting my brain how annoying that is. All right let's go. Time to go. Time to go go go go go.
[22361.24s -> 22422.38s]  Man. Should have healed. It's just the plane that you're looking at. This makes it
[22422.38s -> 22428.57s]  because here okay here's the thing right? So the right stick I have to constantly when I do
[22428.57s -> 22433.85s]  this this is me. This is me using the right stick right? So even when I'm locked on right now
[22433.85s -> 22439.29s]  that doesn't matter. See I have to always be keeping him in focus with right stick.
[22440.41s -> 22444.65s]  It's like scratching your ass scratching your head rubbing your elbows and
[22444.65s -> 22453.10s]  fucking patting your tummy at the same time. Like I constantly have to have right stick
[22453.10s -> 22545.59s]  moving. Oh shit. Use the steering wheel. Watch out. Watch out. God damn it man. Come on. I
[22545.59s -> 22616.78s]  need to hit him one more fucking time. Get out of my way. Got lucky there. Fuck even. Oh shit.
[22618.63s -> 22666.12s]  Fucking living hell. I'm gonna come. God. I can't fucking see. I don't even have it on my
[22666.12s -> 22705.16s]  why is it not on my hot bar? Of all the things to not have. No sensitivity change will
[22705.16s -> 22728.57s]  help either. Just dodge. I wish it was that easy. Try parries. No I gotta just get the
[22729.45s -> 22735.53s]  actually I probably should do parries because dodging around a boss is almost
[22735.53s -> 22755.45s]  uncompletable. So maybe parries will work. Let's see what we got. Fire.
[22762.81s -> 22776.25s]  I don't think I really have much. This is gonna fuck up my rolls. I mean I already have
[22776.25s -> 22788.06s]  this on my mid rolling. Equip the embers. This is the worst thing because I've sold
[22788.06s -> 22803.13s]  this shitload of them. Like this sucks. See what I'm talking about? See what I mean?
[22804.17s -> 22810.07s]  Like that shit happens all the fucking time. There's there's no way to counteract it. He's
[22810.07s -> 22813.99s]  just gonna like teleport around and I have to oh I why why haven't explained it? I've
[22813.99s -> 22849.56s]  explained it like 30 times already. Not myself. It's time to give up. I'm so close. I gotta
[22849.56s -> 22856.68s]  have done like half health and I know what I'm doing is excruciating and is very very very
[22856.68s -> 22863.50s]  hard and unnecessary but I'm gonna try to do it. If I pulled out the third person I would beat
[22863.50s -> 22869.45s]  this first try. I would put fifty thousand dollars on that. But doesn't matter. I'm gonna
[22869.45s -> 22908.81s]  do this. I'm gonna do it the way. I'm gonna do it. It's gonna happen. True wall. It doesn't
[22908.81s -> 22913.85s]  seem that hard to me. Stop that. You know it's hard. Don't do that to me. This is
[22913.85s -> 22934.79s]  more of the hardest thing I've ever done on stream. Carnage isn't a superhero. What the
[22934.79s -> 22947.85s]  fuck? Yes he is. You've done harder things. You can do. I know. I can do it. Don't read
[22947.85s -> 22959.96s]  while fighting. I need a little wine. Didn't I say I said this like last stream? No no
[22959.96s -> 22963.88s]  no. The stream before that. You know I think I'm gonna take a break from doing
[22963.88s -> 22994.82s]  fucking really difficult shit on stream. What happened? It's been two days. I got the guy
[22994.82s -> 23002.70s]  behind. Fuck first person mode. Fuck first person mode. It's too much. It's fun for the
[23002.70s -> 23079.06s]  first five hours. Put your face cam in one of the item slots. I'm about to. I've lost
[23079.06s -> 23086.81s]  it all. This is no way. Not anymore. I'm gonna have to put on the funny mods. This
[23086.81s -> 23090.41s]  is just like my tongue is sticking out. Somebody grabbed it. And you just won't
[23090.41s -> 23093.67s]  put my, you won't let me put my tongue back in my mouth. That's what I feel
[23093.67s -> 23102.15s]  like I'm doing. The like right stick. I gotta keep you in frame the whole fucking
[23102.15s -> 23106.79s]  time. Action. Secret show director. Yes will you stay in frame the whole time?
[23106.79s -> 23110.79s]  Let me just move you around and make sure it's like oh what that lock on
[23110.79s -> 23114.39s]  did this on its own? Let me just like keep you in frame. It's me Stephen fucking
[23114.39s -> 23126.98s]  Spielberg. Are you gonna dodge too? Make sure you keep in fucking frame. Make sure
[23126.98s -> 23130.10s]  you like keep him in frame the whole time with the right stick. That's the only
[23130.10s -> 23154.30s]  way it's fucking possible. I can't do mouse and keyboard. The mod is not designed
[23154.30s -> 23160.50s]  to be used with mouse and keyboard. At least for some reason when I do it I have. I'll
[23160.50s -> 23200.94s]  show you. I'm like fucking Spielberg this guy. Just switch to IRL and drink wine.
[23200.94s -> 23213.19s]  I'm about to. It's gonna turn into a fucking wine drinking stream real quick.
[23219.53s -> 23227.78s]  Oh no. It's too fucking hard to do this. If only the lock on would just stay on
[23227.78s -> 23231.22s]  and I didn't have to use right stick to constantly keep them in front of me.
[23231.86s -> 23240.71s]  I'm about to just start drinking on stream. I need to level up. There's so many things wrong here.
[23264.46s -> 23269.58s]  Damn it. I can't help it. I have to do it again. I'm losing my hair watching this stream. I'm
[23269.58s -> 23296.17s]  losing my mind playing this stream. You gotta give me a break here. Here comes his fucking
[23296.17s -> 23303.78s]  friend. Change the bindings. How would that help? It's still right stick. It's not like it'll
[23303.78s -> 23330.54s]  change anything because I wasn't locked on the right guy. Get out of here. Oh nothing to do
[23330.54s -> 23341.59s]  with you. Still here. All right I'm not reading chat anymore. I'm gonna focus on the video game.
[23342.23s -> 23368.06s]  I got an idea. The distance. The distance. It's hard to tell what the distance is.
[23372.41s -> 23382.66s]  I can feel it. I can feel it in my mouth. The saltine crackers that are just building up
[23383.62s -> 23394.63s]  and they won't stop. They're in my mouth. This is supposed to be Dark Souls silly
[23394.63s -> 23402.47s]  mods night and it turned into the impossible first person challenge somehow over the course
[23402.47s -> 23444.52s]  of this evening. What's what is going on? We're going as the invisible fucking man now.
[23444.52s -> 23458.41s]  Here it comes. Did anyone even put you up to this challenge? No. I don't know why I continued
[23458.41s -> 23464.57s]  to do it. I don't know. I just felt it was fun. I had a great time and I still did. It
[23464.57s -> 23470.33s]  was fun and I really enjoyed it. I did. I truly did. But I hit the wall and now it's time to be
[23470.33s -> 23485.77s]  the invisible man and I'm gonna beat it first fucking try. I'm gonna beat it as the invisible
[23485.77s -> 23504.74s]  fucking man. This is almost as bad. It kind of is. This is not one of the mods I assure you.
[23505.38s -> 23526.95s]  Why do I feel like I'm running? Why am I slow? Am I slow? I feel slow. Or am I just
[23526.95s -> 23539.70s]  getting like strangely baited by how weird these hands are? I feel like I'm playing
[23539.70s -> 23560.92s]  as one of the launchers. I lose as invisible man, aren't I? I can't lose as invisible man.
[23567.08s -> 23572.28s]  Somehow this is worse. No, it's not. It really isn't. At least I can lock on.
[23601.86s -> 23606.41s]  I don't even know what my character is. This actually might be harder.
[23634.44s -> 23713.32s]  Where am I? Fucking invisible man. It's even worse. I told you I was gonna beat it first
[23713.32s -> 23764.25s]  fucking try. No, that wasn't a joke. I didn't know. I didn't think he was gonna fucking dash
[23764.25s -> 23771.48s]  through. I thought he was gonna do that. I have so much anguish in my body right now.
[23771.48s -> 23776.47s]  This is supposed to be a fun stream and I want to fucking, I want to just,
[23776.47s -> 23783.69s]  I want to throw this guy into a Joker vat of acid. It was supposed to be a jokey
[23783.69s -> 23788.65s]  fun stream and it turned out to be like a tryhard dickhead stream. How did that happen?
[23789.61s -> 23807.18s]  That doesn't like to get stuck in a corner, you dick. It's because I've refused it,
[23807.18s -> 23813.62s]  but I was having fun. I can't fucking believe it. Like I literally beat it and like I had to just
[23813.62s -> 23820.89s]  start talking. This is un-fucking-believable. Even as the invisible goddamn man, like I had it.
[23821.53s -> 23840.34s]  It was over. In fact, get this off. I'm so used to like the first person shit. Oh my god,
[23840.34s -> 23848.42s]  I'm gonna pee my pants. I don't even care if it's on stream. I'm just gonna stop pissing.
[23857.83s -> 23863.67s]  Oh, I'm so sad right now. There's too many emotions in my brain. I have to fucking just
[23863.67s -> 23867.75s]  den this. I had it. It was first try third person and I guaranteed it and it was a
[23867.75s -> 23874.12s]  guarantee because it actually, I thought it, here we go. No more talking. Beat Abyss Washer.
[23874.92s -> 23880.36s]  Fucking the Washer. I can't, I don't think I will. I, you literally came to the arcade
[23880.36s -> 23885.96s]  and you took a sludge hammer. You sludge hammered the pinball machine. I am so far
[23886.04s -> 23894.82s]  beyond being able to do this. You came in and you just started shaking the pinball machine
[23894.82s -> 23899.22s]  and you screamed at it. You put your foot through it. I can't even do it now.
[23899.22s -> 23916.30s]  And this boss is not even that hard. It's unbelievable. It's truly un-fucking-believable
[23916.30s -> 23927.51s]  that I just let that happen. Abyss Watchers are like the, like the 30% of the way into the
[23927.51s -> 23934.70s]  game and I've let first person Parasite attach itself to my fucking cerebral cortex
[23941.46s -> 23946.89s]  and it's making me want to punt my monitor 2000 yards. Holy shit people are giving a ton
[23946.89s -> 23959.62s]  of community subs. Oh my god. Thank you Great Canadian Fuck Club and Kazzee for the subs.
[23960.58s -> 23984.81s]  Somehow I'm still here. I like love this game too. I've beat this game like five
[23984.81s -> 23990.65s]  fucking times and we're at that stage of grief now. Where I'm walking around is the
[23990.65s -> 24007.93s]  jokey enemy from Warcraft. This is a card in Hearthstone. This is a card in Hearthstone.
[24007.93s -> 24011.21s]  It makes your opponent draw a card when he dies. I don't even know what the fuck the thing
[24011.21s -> 24029.80s]  is called. Sword card. Dual swords. Where the fuck is the character? I just don't know. I'm
[24029.80s -> 24043.94s]  too fucking handsome. I appreciate, I really appreciate all the people giving me tips in
[24043.94s -> 24047.70s]  the chat but you have to understand something. I've beat these guys like probably seven or eight
[24047.70s -> 24052.42s]  times and it was just like a leisurely playthrough on like my eighth character.
[24053.30s -> 24077.96s]  Oh I hate this. I'm so tilted. I'm not even a human anymore. I'm no longer a person. I've
[24077.96s -> 24096.18s]  transcended being a human. It might be time to silly mod mode because I am so tilted right
[24096.18s -> 24115.43s]  now. I don't think I'll ever beat these guys like ever again. Why can I not see my
[24115.43s -> 24122.71s]  character? This would be so much easier if I could. Oh man. You know I sometimes I sit there
[24122.71s -> 24127.83s]  and I think about like what's gonna happen on the screen. If you had told me, hey Jeremy
[24127.83s -> 24131.59s]  uh on your next stream you're gonna do a Dark Souls mod stream. You're gonna get stuck on
[24131.59s -> 24136.87s]  a fist washers for three hours. I'd be like you're something wrong with your rank. Like
[24137.43s -> 24145.72s]  there's no way. No way. You're crazy. No fucking way. And here we are. Here we are
[24145.72s -> 24151.91s]  in seven hours into the stream. Stuck on the goddamn abyss watchers as invisible man.
[24152.71s -> 24208.39s]  Damn. Five flasks. I can't fucking believe this. This build is so bad. Everything about this is
[24208.39s -> 24255.69s]  so bad. It was just a first. No why am I still invisible man? I turned it off.
[24256.33s -> 24280.18s]  I think I have to restart the whole game. I fucked myself from the very beginning.
[24281.16s -> 24302.33s]  All right. All right. Bullshit. Fuck you. Hard to see. Playing like this. No way. I don't believe
[24302.33s -> 24306.33s]  it. I don't believe it. No. And there we go. Now I'm a fucking person again. Let's try it now
[24306.33s -> 24311.74s]  as an actual person. Let me try it now as a the way the game is supposed to be played.
[24311.74s -> 24333.26s]  Not as invisible man. Not as first person mode. What did I just turn on? I have no idea.
[24333.26s -> 24344.76s]  I'm so fucking tilted right now. No. It went from like the first four and a half hours
[24344.76s -> 24350.04s]  of the stream was. This is fun. This is all fun. I love it. This is a great time.
[24350.04s -> 24354.36s]  Oh first person. Let me know. First person is really fun. This is interesting. Look
[24354.36s -> 24376.60s]  have you ever seen the game from this perspective before? And now I'm like I should
[24376.60s -> 24381.80s]  have just opened up the fast funny mod at four hours. You guys were right. You had the right
[24381.80s -> 24389.42s]  idea. You all knew this was going to happen. You knew I was going to get like to like a
[24389.42s -> 24393.82s]  boss that you can't do it on and I was going to lose my fucking mind and then here we are.
[24394.54s -> 24403.43s]  You guys have the prediction capability of god damn Nostradamus. The first person was
[24403.43s -> 24409.21s]  really interesting. It's really fun. It's really hard but sometimes I don't. This
[24409.21s -> 24419.43s]  feels very foreign to me. This I don't like how this feels. I'm I don't like this.
[24419.43s -> 24434.82s]  It feels weird. This feels fucking weird. It's almost like my character shouldn't be here.
[24441.85s -> 24466.58s]  Nobody else feel like that? I might have to take a wine only break here
[24467.62s -> 24472.89s]  because everything about the last seven hours has been not this. It's like freaking me out.
[24473.85s -> 24493.16s]  What the fuck? I shouldn't be here right now. Actually it's kind of nice to see where I'm
[24493.16s -> 24509.82s]  going to get hit. I have to give it one at least solid attempt with an actual character.
[24510.78s -> 24545.46s]  Don't blow it here. You got success this time. Just fucking do it. Let's do it. All right.
[24545.46s -> 24681.90s]  Let's try it. Let's go. Oops-a-daisy. First fucking time I put on a god damn no invisible
[24681.90s -> 24685.66s]  man. No first person bullshit. I beat him first try. That's not that bad of a fight.
[24685.66s -> 24690.94s]  I did it first fucking time without the god damn bullshit on it and I've got to see my character
[24690.94s -> 24711.75s]  walk around. I just grabbed the bottle of wine. I'm not even drinking out of the glass anymore.
[24711.75s -> 24741.64s]  What a sicko. No put that down. Okay that was fun. All I take was just to play Dark Souls.
[24741.64s -> 24746.44s]  I just had to play Dark Souls 3 and I did it the first time I played Dark Souls 3.
[24747.64s -> 24752.60s]  It's time to get fucking silly okay. You ready for silly? You ready for silly mods?
[24763.22s -> 24767.21s]  What time is it? Oh wait we're still early? Is it still early? You still guys ready to go?
[24770.28s -> 24788.33s]  Time to get fucking wacky. Why did I do that? Why did I do first person for seven hours?
[24788.33s -> 24796.33s]  There's no reason for what I just did. Oh my god. What the fuck is wrong with me?
[24798.44s -> 24801.24s]  Something in the water guys. I'm telling you.
[24809.40s -> 24810.60s]  Pretty be careful.
[24816.20s -> 24830.22s]  All right can I I'm gonna buy these back. All right you ready? I have no idea
[24831.10s -> 24839.77s]  what this is gonna do. I'm gonna try it though. Welcome to silly mods. Let's enable this
[24841.54s -> 24863.56s]  and see where it takes us. I might have to restart the game. I do. That's what my character
[24863.56s -> 24872.28s]  looks like. I don't remember. Restart the game and we're gonna do. There are plenty of other
[24872.28s -> 24877.96s]  things but let's be fair. I was having a great time. Even losing. Even getting frustrated. Even
[24877.96s -> 24895.83s]  losing my wine mind. It was a lot of fun. So let's go ahead and do this again. Okay open
[24895.83s -> 24917.29s]  up that. Dark Souls. Liar and a cheater. God that was my own worst enemy for the last hour
[24917.29s -> 24940.71s]  and a half. All right I'm gonna turn uh let's change this to to Dark Souls 3 silly mods.
[24941.51s -> 24956.62s]  How about Dark Souls 3 mod night? We just started. Welcome to the stream.
[24957.50s -> 24974.79s]  Thanks for joining me. Welcome to the stream. Okay so we've got speed modifier. Well actually
[24974.79s -> 24990.62s]  I want to try this one. What the hell this does. I believe this makes every enemy uh a
[24990.70s -> 24999.18s]  prop. Well already right up the bat they're just tombstones.
[25006.65s -> 25033.98s]  This is gonna be horrible. Yeah this is prop hunt Dark Souls. I just want to see. Let's take a
[25033.98s -> 25058.18s]  look. That looks pretty normal so far. Oh I wonder what that is. That's definitely not an
[25058.18s -> 25077.00s]  enemy. Can they even attack? Holy shit okay they can. All right I gotta I don't you can't
[25077.00s -> 25089.85s]  fight. You can't kill that guy. Why are they all the same thing? They're all just they're all just
[25089.85s -> 25101.38s]  fucking tubes. They're just skeleton urns. I don't understand why. There's no other.
[25104.76s -> 25113.66s]  I can't walk onto the meter. Oh there's a barrel.
[25118.76s -> 25120.84s]  There's too many. This one has eyes.
[25136.94s -> 25155.50s]  Mod sucks. What? Let's try another area. I need to see a boss as an urn. Let's head
[25155.50s -> 25169.59s]  to the deacons. First person first person first person are no more donations.
[25170.39s -> 25178.15s]  Is that one of the big guys? I think that's one of the huge guys.
[25180.81s -> 25193.56s]  There's no way to even tell when they're swinging. What's the reason to fight?
[25198.97s -> 25213.82s]  This is fucking stupid. I don't want to play this one. All this mod does is say hey you know
[25213.82s -> 25217.74s]  those enemies that you fight? You don't know when they're going to do their animation.
[25221.56s -> 25228.36s]  Do this and the first person mod. Let's try this with the first person.
[25249.05s -> 25269.96s]  Oh hold on. He's addicted to first person. All right here we go. Why is this person not
[25272.89s -> 25291.00s]  you shouldn't be here like this. Why are you not a bucket? Who the? Why are you guys not
[25291.00s -> 25330.82s]  fucking an enemy object? You're dead. How did you spin around that quickly? Not even fair.
[25331.46s -> 25366.81s]  Are these props? It's just an excuse. He wants to play in first person. No those are
[25366.81s -> 25382.95s]  NPCs so they have to be free ban for a hundred dollars. What? So does the mod work? Of course it
[25382.95s -> 25403.72s]  does. All right that person's a clock. It's a dog. The dogs. I get it. Why is he so fast?
[25404.28s -> 25425.45s]  What the hell was that? Why was he that fast? What? I don't know why he was that fast.
[25426.01s -> 25462.06s]  Where's the other dog? I saw one already. Just get me in the door. Shit. Next. Put them all on at
[25462.06s -> 25479.50s]  once. I will crash the game. I'm just gonna run by. I don't know how many there are but
[25480.30s -> 25499.14s]  boxes are just dropping all over me. What is this thing? What is this? Oh it's one of those
[25499.14s -> 25508.63s]  exploding bats. They light themselves on fire. They run and they land in front of you and
[25508.63s -> 25524.26s]  they blow up. Please do a different mod. Hold on. We've got to get to at least a stopping point
[25524.26s -> 25541.62s]  here. Get out of the fucking way. Grandfather clock asshole. Watch out he's gonna explode.
[25549.64s -> 25559.18s]  What? Oh right there's a bunch of people here. I'm surrounded. I got the shard. Okay.
[25568.71s -> 25593.98s]  All right. All right we're good. I'm not gonna use it. Shut it off. Not yet.
[25597.67s -> 25603.02s]  I got to get to the point. You don't want me to get to the point up here and there's like a
[25603.02s -> 25626.57s]  hundred skeletons. You think that's gonna be fun? Zero viewers. Please. All right that's the DLC.
[25628.57s -> 25635.53s]  Yeah we're gonna go up to the hollow graveyard. You don't want to see that before I turn off
[25635.53s -> 25655.75s]  this dumb mod. All right what do you think? Boxes? Clocks? You can't fool me. Is that it?
[25656.23s -> 25699.00s]  Is it actually an urn? No. They throw up too. How many more? This was funny for four minutes tops.
[25699.80s -> 25714.23s]  Well don't worry. When I get up here we're gonna turn it off. Isn't there a
[25715.19s -> 25733.45s]  strong enemy up here? There's an NPC up here right? Ow. Is that it? That's an NPC.
[25733.93s -> 25765.03s]  Oh shit. Fucking urn chased me all the way. All right time for a new mod.
[25771.51s -> 25784.87s]  What else we got? All right let's take it off first person. Oh boy. Okay let's take it off.
[25785.59s -> 25800.52s]  So here's the difference here. What does this one do? This one is supposed to be
[25801.16s -> 25810.36s]  player size. I wonder how I don't think I might have to restart this one. What
[25810.76s -> 25825.30s]  whatever this one does. What's this one? So this is a speed modifier. This is randomizing
[25825.30s -> 25839.29s]  the speed of the game. This is just horrible. This is just lag. I don't want to play like this.
[25843.38s -> 25885.50s]  This is terrible. This is playing with 500 ping. Activate all mods at once. I'll do it before we
[25885.50s -> 25923.46s]  leave. No I don't like this. I gotta get out of this. All right hold on. Let's try this. I'm
[25923.46s -> 25932.98s]  gonna die here. It doesn't matter. Okay what if I do uh let's see like times point five speed.
[25932.98s -> 25950.87s]  What does that do? Merciful goddess of the forlorn place to call their own.
[25950.87s -> 25955.58s]  Is this my character? Bear witness to our resolve.
[25959.10s -> 25976.97s]  Versus bosses? This would be fucking ridiculous. Turn-based combat. But is it just me or is
[25977.05s -> 25999.32s]  all the enemies too? I have to fight a boss with this. You can see every frame. I don't think it's
[25999.32s -> 26029.26s]  everybody. I think it's just me. Is it? No it's everybody. What? This is I can queue up every
[26029.26s -> 26054.17s]  dodge. This is amazing. Wait wait wait don't do it yet. He's gonna jump. What? All right
[26054.17s -> 26091.93s]  well that was fun. Let's try this. Oh man. Where? I don't know where. What direction do I go?
[26092.73s -> 26107.88s]  Wait hold on. I got an idea. I got an idea. I got an idea. This is gonna be fucking great.
[26107.88s -> 26132.06s]  Watch this one. Check this out. Ready? This is gonna be real fucking cool. Okay so I can
[26132.06s -> 26158.81s]  control it a little better now. Watch this. Oops. Go back to Andre.
[26168.25s -> 26170.49s]  Let me try to get somewhere reliably.
[26204.14s -> 26239.22s]  I hate everything about this. This is the worst one yet. No fuck. Now wait wait wait wait.
[26239.22s -> 26248.44s]  There's also something else I can do here. Hold on. I need to get in here. You're gonna love
[26248.44s -> 26264.36s]  this one. But my weapons. My weapons are still too big. Little like rat mode with huge weapons.
[26265.00s -> 26303.06s]  This is normal speed. My hitbox is tiny. First person with this model.
[26303.78s -> 26328.74s]  Now hold on. Let me just get to another place to go. Tiny first person mode. Hold on. Gnome
[26328.74s -> 26354.62s]  fury warrior. All right I gotta turn my speed down. Hold on. Is it safe? Don't worry he's
[26354.62s -> 26376.44s]  not gonna hit me. All right first person. Weapon. Okay here we go. Weapon size.
[26388.41s -> 26398.58s]  Uh what are these things called? Are these thrusting swords? What are these?
[26399.14s -> 26409.43s]  Are they not curved swords? Daggers? What would these be classified as? Curve swords?
[26409.43s -> 26418.09s]  Okay what are they what are they even called? Carthus curve swords? What are they called?
[26420.70s -> 26448.34s]  The twin blades right? They're not here. I'm trying to find them. I'm trying to find out
[26448.34s -> 26454.20s]  what these are called so I can enable this because they're not I don't see them on any
[26454.20s -> 26502.97s]  list. Maybe I can't change them. The fall damage is not significant at all. I don't even
[26502.97s -> 26537.24s]  know where I am. I'm okay. I gotta I gotta slow down though. Hold on. Okay player. I gotta
[26537.24s -> 26545.88s]  turn down like the stupid mod for speed. That's probably better. And then first person.
[26553.82s -> 26566.20s]  Okay well that didn't really work did it? That didn't work.
[26581.70s -> 26605.58s]  I'm swinging over this enemy. No I don't. Nice. What the fuck? All right right right.
[26605.58s -> 26638.90s]  Okay this is too much. Hold on. I don't know what this does. Green? No skeleton swap. Wait wait
[26638.90s -> 26655.11s]  wait wait wait. This is let's let's simmer this down a little bit. Okay come back to normal.
[26655.11s -> 26673.50s]  Okay everything's back to normal. Now let's do this. I think this I can be an enemy. Let's go
[26673.50s -> 26691.90s]  back to what we were doing. So let's go small. Okay first person. Let's see if we can do it in
[26691.90s -> 26701.32s]  first person. Not really. No it doesn't work. Oh that's funky. You can't do small in first
[26701.32s -> 26715.67s]  person. It's not gonna work. In fact I think I broke the game. I think it's all fucked up.
[26715.67s -> 26757.24s]  Nobody's jiggling around. Oh there we go. All right I'm ready. Let's play. Oh why am I going so
[26757.24s -> 26796.81s]  slow? Why am I this slow? That's better right? There we go. All right now I'm gonna do a boss.
[26796.81s -> 26811.69s]  Where's the nearest boss? Oh the deacons. Right. I gotta go all the way down for that
[26811.69s -> 26843.58s]  though don't I? There's the skeleton king. That's true. Speed it up. The deacons are
[26843.58s -> 26852.10s]  gonna be harder at this size. They probably will. What about up here? Not up here? I'm so
[26852.10s -> 26869.42s]  cute and tiny. I really just am. Run little buddy. Yeah I got this already. I think I have
[26869.42s -> 26904.62s]  to go down here don't I? What? I was too small for the floor.
[26904.62s -> 26924.98s]  Change your weapon so you have a Tom and Jerry melon. Well this is the point of the
[26924.98s -> 26947.14s]  game where I don't really remember exactly where to go. Go back to Firelink. There's just no
[26947.14s -> 26959.50s]  clip to the deacons. I can't do that. I don't think I can even do that. I think I have to
[26959.50s -> 26973.59s]  go through here. It's to the right of the cathedral. I'll get down. Hold on. I have
[26973.59s -> 26982.41s]  to go around and then I was going the right way wasn't I? Go back to Firelink. What's it
[26982.41s -> 27000.58s]  Firelink? Oh Andre. Yeah but I mean who cares? Andre's small so don't you want to see the
[27000.58s -> 27007.86s]  deacons? Let me just at least try to get. Okay if I can't do this then I'll go back.
[27019.58s -> 27026.66s]  Do a skeleton swap with a normal size character. Well I need like an ID. I need an ID
[27026.66s -> 27049.96s]  number. All right is this gonna work? This is not gonna work. I'm in the wall. I need to be
[27049.96s -> 27077.77s]  bigger first. All right I'm gonna go the other way. That was the wrong way anyways.
[27078.57s -> 27106.07s]  The fall joke returns and I wasn't even trying to do it. I tried to climb back up. Okay so
[27106.07s -> 27109.51s]  I'm gonna go through here. I'm trying to just remember where the hell to go for progression.
[27116.52s -> 27151.05s]  This way? He's not gonna hit me with this anyway. All right so now uh this way.
[27151.77s -> 27168.98s]  Is there a way for me to get up from here? Okay yeah now I remember. Okay I know I remember.
[27170.30s -> 27202.57s]  I remember. It's actually fairly hard to control. I'm so small. Put on the Looney Tunes
[27202.57s -> 27218.81s]  soundtrack. Don't go that way. Looney Tunes OST. They don't even have an OST. They have
[27218.81s -> 27284.26s]  like a theme song. All right we're getting there. Oh fuck! Why do you want Dr. Phil with all
[27284.26s -> 27303.58s]  the things right now? All right it's time to make this a little more interesting.
[27304.38s -> 27323.85s]  Once I get the shortcut I'm gonna make it interesting. I'm gonna decrease my speed by...
[27325.56s -> 27336.71s]  What the fuck just happened? Oh my god I wasn't fighting way enough. What? Oh no that's not
[27336.71s -> 27400.42s]  good. Can I speedrun this? I don't think I can. That's so unfortunate. I was right there
[27400.42s -> 27422.33s]  too. How slow are these guys? They're very slow. All right so I got the right idea. Oops here we go.
[27422.33s -> 27442.94s]  Ready? This should be good. Now we're just cheating. Yeah this is not even a mod at this
[27442.94s -> 27459.05s]  point. It's just cheating. You were at the first shortcut literally. I know it sucks.
[27468.57s -> 27477.11s]  Just beat the game in an hour? That's a pretty good challenge to me. I'll take that
[27477.11s -> 27573.05s]  challenge. I almost fell. Oh fuck. Shortcut! This won't let me. It won't let me. It's just
[27573.05s -> 27582.57s]  stopping me. Fucking Jesus we've done this like 50 times. Oh my god just I don't even care. I
[27582.57s -> 27588.55s]  don't even need it. Let's go. I don't even need a shortcut at this point. Just get there.
[27608.66s -> 27617.54s]  It is late right now. Damn. It's like it's very late for you guys. I'm surprised
[27617.54s -> 27624.62s]  there's still this many people here. There's like 34 3500 people here. Holy shit. Thanks for
[27624.62s -> 27631.94s]  sticking around guys. Hope you're having a good time. I am. This is just stupid enough to keep
[27631.94s -> 27660.36s]  my attention. All right this is a lot. I'm just gonna run right to the deacons. This is
[27660.36s -> 27668.81s]  actually making it harder. Don't do that because you're going so fast you can't even
[27668.81s -> 27677.64s]  see what's in front of you. All right don't fuck this up again. Just go to the deacons.
[27678.36s -> 27685.00s]  I need to beat Dark Souls 3 in an hour. What time is it? All right I have an hour to beat the
[27685.00s -> 27718.62s]  whole game. I'll get you real soon. Fuck it. I can fall from this high. Can I? Can I do it?
[27718.62s -> 27752.76s]  Yep we're good. This is just cheating. There's no. This is just. Yeah it's a quick silver
[27752.76s -> 27820.39s]  mod. It's not even hard. I can just beat everything. All right let's just. That guy
[27820.39s -> 27825.83s]  got a shot off. Look at this guy. You motherfucker.
[27832.33s -> 27838.20s]  Why don't we make it a little fucking easy. You can everyone say oh you're doing
[27838.20s -> 27843.67s]  all your cheater. You're a cheater. Let's see how you feel. Let's see how you feel now.
[27844.31s -> 27906.86s]  Where's the deacon? Catch the mouse. Yes. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[27906.86s -> 27977.88s]  Oh god. He's too hard to target. Too fast. Too fast. Too fast. It's possible.
[27978.84s -> 27992.62s]  Somebody's got fire breath. It's just deacon finfall. All right okay. Okay.
[27993.50s -> 28014.82s]  Okay that was fun. This is really funny. Oh that was fun wasn't it? Okay let's change the
[28014.82s -> 28024.71s]  player size. That's too big. Uh I don't know why that's still so big. I shouldn't be this
[28024.71s -> 28052.52s]  big. It's on my head. Oh my fucking god. I'm gonna lose. And the hunter just became the hunter.
[28065.32s -> 28070.52s]  Why can't I hurt these guys? That's the guy. That's the deacon right there.
[28071.94s -> 28116.01s]  I can't hurt him. Okay back to normal. Holy fuck. All right let's be the deacon. Oh yeah
[28116.01s -> 28131.26s]  what about the one hour challenge? Hold on. Hold on. They sell. They seem a little too slow.
[28131.26s -> 28134.38s]  I think it's just because it was so fucked up from everything that happened so far.
[28135.34s -> 28147.74s]  All right so the deacons just became. Some of them became chairs. Some of them became statues.
[28148.30s -> 28174.47s]  Don't you wish this is what the original fight was? All right where is he?
[28174.47s -> 28203.34s]  Who has the glow? Shit. I'm not gonna get cursed. Don't worry.
[28205.58s -> 28215.61s]  Oh it is kind of hard to tell when they're gonna do anything.
[28228.34s -> 28235.93s]  Holy shit I watched it happen. They're mis-cheating and losing at one of the
[28235.93s -> 28244.79s]  easiest boss fights. They're all chairs. Do you understand? I can't lose here though for real.
[28244.79s -> 28288.25s]  Imagine losing to a chair and I can't lock on to them. Oh god damn it. What a mess.
[28288.97s -> 28309.06s]  What a mess. Die now. Die now. Oh god. Which chair is he? Where was the cursed menu?
[28309.06s -> 28351.50s]  Where was the cursed menu? That's the end of the stream. I'm trying skeleton swap.
[28353.50s -> 28372.70s]  Model ID. There's like pus of man. Some of these don't work. Player. What are these?
[28373.43s -> 28395.85s]  It's like 2000. Doesn't seem to do anything. I would love to be a chair. Model. Because it's
[28395.85s -> 28406.89s]  given me IDs but it's not changing to anything. Player model. Cathedral knight.
[28415.16s -> 28444.79s]  Oh my god. What is happening? What scarecrow enemy is this? What is going on?
[28444.79s -> 28463.67s]  No this is me. It's making my skeleton different. I see. Okay hold on. Let me take. Oh fuck.
[28463.67s -> 28481.40s]  This is not good. Let's reload him. Reload player. There we are. So we gotta get off all
[28481.40s -> 28498.36s]  this bullshit. Okay. Let's try this again. This time we're gonna do hollow outside a
[28498.36s -> 28545.22s]  crystal sage. How do I swing? Can I even attack? I don't think I can attack. Physical
[28545.22s -> 28552.65s]  pain. To a passive run. I gotta get back to the god damn deacons like this okay?
[28552.65s -> 28579.91s]  I wanna equip the weapon. I can't. Let me see if there's just no animation. I don't think so. Hold
[28579.91s -> 28597.98s]  on. Um what the hell is this gonna look like I wonder? It's just a face. That's it. It's
[28597.98s -> 28616.18s]  just a face. What about giant rat? Oh what? What is the knife in the back of my head?
[28618.39s -> 28627.35s]  The sword is in my skull. What? It's through my fucking face. Oh come on. This is the
[28627.35s -> 28649.22s]  stupidest thing ever. I didn't even get the deacon shortcut either. I can't even. No no
[28649.22s -> 28672.66s]  no no no no. Can I drink? I can't even drink estus. Oh that's so ridiculous. Hold on let me
[28672.66s -> 28712.18s]  just see if I can. Maybe animation override maybe. I need to be able to attack. Uh which
[28712.18s -> 28725.11s]  way is the head? Is that a foot up top? I think that's a foot up there. But I still
[28725.11s -> 28760.31s]  can't swing a weapon. Let me see. Okay we've got angel, tree hollow, dancer. Here's dancer. Uh oh
[28760.31s -> 28792.39s]  that crashed again. Game crashed. Phone's over. Unequip the weapons. Yeah the fun is over.
[28792.39s -> 28813.06s]  No that doesn't look right. I thought I just got banned. I was like oh no that's not good.
[28813.70s -> 28828.68s]  Alright let's go ahead and try this again. I'm gonna take off my weapons though.
[28830.71s -> 28838.50s]  Banned from single player. I don't know. Alright weapons are off. I just have fists. I have no
[28838.50s -> 28847.74s]  equipment on. Nothing. Get rid of all equipment. See if I can do anything now. Skeleton swap.
[28851.69s -> 28868.70s]  Let's give it a go. So we got dancer. We can't do dancer. Let's try tree hollow.
[28869.42s -> 28898.25s]  It's just an extra large foot. Some of them just crashed the game. Yeah that's what he
[28898.25s -> 28916.07s]  just said. Parade float. Oh that was good. It was really good. So this is not gonna work.
[28922.76s -> 28931.02s]  What else we got? Painter, ice crab, cinder. Here's yorm. Yorm's gonna crash the game.
[28931.02s -> 28974.79s]  I would put money on it. No it's not. I'm coming. I'm coming to get you lord of cinder.
[29002.42s -> 29007.83s]  God he fell. He fell one foot. Yeah I know. Alright let's see a few more of these and then I'm
[29007.83s -> 29016.57s]  probably gonna call it a night. It's been a long night of absolute bullshit. Pontiff.
[29026.06s -> 29040.41s]  Animation override. I wonder what this means. Half the stream was you dying to abyss watchers.
[29041.69s -> 29056.58s]  Well sometimes that's what happens. You have to bind the animations in order to use attacks.
[29057.38s -> 29076.30s]  Really? Hmm. Oh this is gonna crash the stream. Is it? This is the great way. This is the tree.
[29077.18s -> 29104.94s]  But wait. We can see the whole thing. Hold on. Come on. I can't make myself smaller.
[29105.50s -> 29135.85s]  I can't. I wish I could see. I can't get out of the door. This is just a big piece of wood.
[29136.89s -> 29167.46s]  It's a shovel. Did I kill somebody? No that's not what I think it is right?
[29168.42s -> 29177.72s]  No it isn't. That's a leg. We just almost got to see the head. Can you see my head up there?
[29178.44s -> 29201.86s]  Look at how tiny the head is. Look at the shadow. Pinhead. Alright let's try like one or two more
[29201.86s -> 29229.98s]  and then I'm gonna call it. This is a deacon. That's not too crazy. Do the crab? Okay we'll
[29229.98s -> 29268.97s]  do crab. Crab. Did you hear this? Uh where's the crab? Uh giant crab there in the face.
[29281.48s -> 29286.82s]  You can hear the legs too. Did you force animation override? I did.
[29287.62s -> 29307.18s]  I have that on right now. It's a new emote. I don't think so. It's too scary.
[29307.74s -> 29314.52s]  No we already did the dog. Stray demon. This one will be interesting.
[29315.32s -> 29347.61s]  Really? I can't even walk by this guy? You're not making it easy.
[29348.33s -> 29369.34s]  Kick him off. Kick. Do an emote. Can you do mid-ear? It doesn't look like a lot of
[29369.34s -> 29382.79s]  bosses are on here. Let me see. Last one crashed the game pretty hard so I killed
[29382.79s -> 29394.86s]  that guy by jumping on him. Let's see if mid-ear is here. Mid-ear. Mimic is on here somehow.
[29395.50s -> 29430.23s]  That's scary. That's really scary. Crystal lizard. Let's see if we can find mid-ear.
[29430.23s -> 29457.06s]  Oh here's vort. Here's a boss. Well I should be able to make it to the deacons like this.
[29467.16s -> 29472.65s]  The same bridge. It's too hard to cross it. There's too much going on. You can't go over that
[29472.65s -> 29499.94s]  bridge. What? Why did I become a fucking ant? That's way less intimidating. Tree frog. Okay
[29499.94s -> 29540.44s]  reload. Let's do. Okay there's vort. A few more. Let's see. Great wolf. Oh here's ice crab.
[29540.44s -> 29553.38s]  Maybe this will look better. That's a crash. Fuck. All right I think that's probably a good
[29553.38s -> 29569.03s]  place to call it. Boo boo boo. Do the skeleton. Maybe like I'll do like a watch your ears.
[29569.03s -> 29580.04s]  It's gonna be love. Andre with speed on max. There are seven hours of first person. Well
[29580.12s -> 29603.90s]  to be fair this stream was titled first person dark souls 3. All right so let's
[29604.62s -> 29619.05s]  we're normal here. Let's go ahead and activate it again. Is there anything it didn't do? Skeleton
[29619.05s -> 29634.22s]  swap. Jojo mod. What the hell is Jojo mod? What did I just do? What did I just become?
[29634.22s -> 29665.54s]  What am I? What happened? What the fuck is? I'm like a little burnt turd. Oh that didn't
[29665.86s -> 29679.93s]  do anything. Let me try that again. I have the tiny mod. No all the mods have been refreshed.
[29680.73s -> 29706.47s]  Okay enable. What the fuck I did? The game is just imploding. Die to reset
[29706.47s -> 29722.55s]  tiny. Well what are these? Like a fire startup? Pet cemetery. Come on get outside quick. Well
[29722.55s -> 29749.48s]  we're seeing my persona. Get out there come on. Go. Do I really have to make the speed
[29749.48s -> 29760.46s]  faster? That's not what I wanted. Oh I almost made everybody throw up including myself.
[29767.03s -> 29779.50s]  I think I crashed it. Damn it. No I think I'm all right. No it's crashed. Shit I did
[29779.50s -> 29789.46s]  negative. I did upside down mode somehow. Yeah this thing's fucked up. All right that's
[29789.46s -> 29805.29s]  gonna be it guys. Thanks for watching dark souls 3 first person and uh extra just cheating.
[29805.93s -> 29817.50s]  Thanks for watching the guy plays first person dark souls 3 then cheats for an hour.
[29817.50s -> 29825.03s]  You've got all the mods at once. You know what I'll give it to you. I'm gonna give you all the
[29825.03s -> 29849.11s]  mods at once and I'm gonna try to beat the game. Let's give it a whirl. Fall joke incoming
[29849.11s -> 29866.41s]  that would be nice if uh if I wasn't gonna give myself impossible to die hp. Uh no it's
[29866.41s -> 29878.79s]  it's opening. We're good. This guy is addicted to dark souls. No I was addicted to
[29878.79s -> 29893.32s]  the first person watchers. Two week video game bender. All right it's time to activate
[29893.32s -> 29906.09s]  everything at once. It's 2 a.m. It's midnight pacific which means it is very late for
[29906.09s -> 29923.19s]  everybody else. All right first person cam activate. Also size modifier activate.
[29930.14s -> 29958.92s]  Oh that just makes okay never mind. Speed modifier activate. How fast? That's way too
[29959.00s -> 29975.78s]  fast. Okay looks good. Lighting modifier. Oh we're going with this one. Whatever
[29975.78s -> 29985.40s]  okay no not that one. That just makes the whole thing dark. To make it really dark.
[29991.22s -> 30000.26s]  I don't want to do that. Brightness. Oh there's a glow. What the hell does glow do?
[30000.26s -> 30009.51s]  This makes everything glowy. I don't understand what this one does.
[30010.07s -> 30031.29s]  Now that's just your eyes hurt simulator. Just more bloom. All right we've got uh
[30031.85s -> 30041.16s]  first pro. Okay that that's we pretty much got everything. Aggression mod is on.
[30042.04s -> 30064.76s]  So that's on. They all are going to have red eyes apparently. I'm not turning on upside down
[30064.76s -> 30086.47s]  mode. Everybody's barrel. No that one sucks. Uh what else? Speed. Manual control. What is
[30086.47s -> 30097.38s]  going on? Why did I die? What did I turn on? It's the aggression mod. Okay he just came.
[30097.94s -> 30107.43s]  All right well let's go. I'm ready. You ready? You ready for me to beat the game in 20 minutes?
[30107.99s -> 30162.78s]  Let's go. Faster. I can't go faster. I end up in a wall somewhere. Faster. Faster. I can
[30162.78s -> 30167.50s]  probably do it faster. Hold on to your hats. Uh if you're motion if you get motion sick
[30167.50s -> 30172.31s]  very easily I'm gonna warn you right now. You're gonna puke. You will throw up from this.
[30172.31s -> 30176.31s]  So just be careful. You know minimize the window like a little bit if you need to.
[30177.27s -> 30192.79s]  Uh speed modifier. There it is. What's wrong with this guy?
[30196.71s -> 30232.84s]  Here we go. Time to fucking puke. I'm gonna beat the whole game without stopping moving.
[30232.84s -> 30271.66s]  What is that? Oh it's okay it's those guys. Okay that guy is still on fire and he's still
[30271.66s -> 30328.33s]  running over here. Stop. No I didn't. I just turned. Let's go. It's because my character is
[30328.41s -> 30372.33s]  two feet tall. He's stuffed. You need to restart. This is taking too long. It's because it's the
[30372.33s -> 30460.95s]  deacons. Okay okay go go go go go go. I don't know where to go. I have no idea. I feel bad
[30460.95s -> 30463.51s]  for anybody that's coming to the stream that has never seen this game before.
[30464.31s -> 30544.52s]  They're probably just like thanks for ruining the whole game. How did I get these spells on
[30544.52s -> 30600.87s]  my character? I didn't know if the speed or something was gonna fuck up and not let me
[30600.87s -> 30613.34s]  out. The game just that's it. That's goodbye. Game crashed for real. This is skip. I just
[30613.34s -> 30627.61s]  didn't know if I could just whatever. That's it. Oh that was mentally draining. That was a lot
[30627.61s -> 30635.22s]  of fun but holy shit that was just too much stimulation and too much abyss watchers. Too
[30635.22s -> 30650.62s]  much first person. That was a lot of fun but those of you that are still around we're
[30650.62s -> 30658.92s]  gonna do the bits. That was Dark Souls 3 with some mods. The challenge mods more specifically.
[30666.68s -> 30673.80s]  And I will see you guys. I'm not gonna be live tomorrow. Well tomorrow as in today because
[30673.80s -> 30689.72s]  it's currently 12 30 am on Sunday. So no stream on Sunday. I will be back and we will do
[30690.60s -> 30695.26s]  we're gonna finally do some Dreamcast stuff on Monday or I might do Lifeline.
[30696.14s -> 30703.72s]  This is so many options. There's so many fun fucking things to do. And then 23rd we've got the
[30704.76s -> 30713.35s]  duct tape goalie stream. Shenmue oh I got this too many things. But thanks for joining me. See
[30713.35s -> 30721.21s]  you guys next time. And we're gonna go back and do the bits from eight and a half hours
[30721.21s -> 30730.12s]  stream. I wonder how much of it was actually on the abyss watchers. Probably at least two
[30730.20s -> 30742.60s]  hours. Rift Dogma? No we'll go back to that. I will absolutely go back to Dragon's Dogma.
[30746.36s -> 30752.52s]  So let's uh let's rifle through these bits. Manboy thanks for the one dollar. He's trying to
[30752.52s -> 30757.30s]  get ahold of Shido but he's blocked my phone calls. I'm sorry to hear that. He didn't have
[30757.30s -> 30761.83s]  his cell phone. I don't know where he got it. Timmy Timtan thanks for the one dollar.

[30902.84s -> 30907.80s]  I don't think Shito is a bad character. I think he's great. I've been framed. I'm an
[30907.80s -> 30910.84s]  innocent man I tell you. You've got to believe me. I can't live my life on the run.
[30911.72s -> 30914.60s]  No you never said anything bad about Shito. We were just kidding around.

[31066.31s -> 31072.95s]  dollars and 33 cents. Praise the German sun sometimes. Thank you Double D for the one
[31072.95s -> 31079.54s]  dollar. Is this a streamer that didn't beat Madeer? I didn't. But I also had three other

[31211.77s -> 31222.81s]  much Sharplion. I'm honored to be your favorite YouTuber. Although I don't necessarily
[31222.81s -> 31228.50s]  make a bunch of YouTube videos anymore. Still surprisingly people still say that same thing.
[31229.30s -> 31237.06s]  It's very very humbling to me. I'm I'm fucking honored. Thank you. All these years later.
[31239.38s -> 31242.74s]  Double D thanks for the one dollar. Please stop swearing. I'm gonna be grounded for like a
[31242.74s -> 31248.02s]  month if you keep this up. I'm using my family computer by the way. Also do you want to come
[31248.02s -> 31252.10s]  over to my house for a sleepover and play Minecraft? My mom says we can stay up until

[31261.24s -> 31265.32s]  Jeremy you're such a good chuckle to watch as always. Really glad you put up with our shit
[31265.32s -> 31270.76s]  posting. The fact you read all these bit donations off at the end is crazy. I almost wonder if I
[31270.76s -> 31274.36s]  could buy like a hundred dollars worth of bits and make you read off the start of a novel.
[31275.08s -> 31291.51s]  You may not want to read that part. Someone may actually do it. Don't do that. Too chunky
[31291.51s -> 31299.78s]  to eat thanks for the 10 dollars. Too chunky. Yo Jeremy just like you know, just like you
[31299.86s -> 31308.20s]  to know that you're amazing and lighting up my day with your streams. 10 dollars. Just a very
[31308.20s -> 31319.74s]  very nice wonderful thing to say to somebody. Thank you so much too chunky. It means a lot.
[31319.74s -> 31324.65s]  Thank you. Thank you the Jewish bro for the one dollar. Could you play Fallout 3 modded?

[31369.48s -> 31375.32s]  No don't do that. Don't. I was telling you not to do that because of how ridiculous it would be
[31375.32s -> 31379.40s]  to even remotely attempt to do that. That I don't want that to beat. That's not the
[31379.40s -> 31385.64s]  Jerma985 challenge. You know what the Jerma985 challenge would be? When you get your food at
[31385.64s -> 31404.30s]  the window give him a five dollar bill as a tip. How's that for a challenge? What if
[31404.30s -> 31410.30s]  they don't accept tips? Then you go oh well. Are you sure? Okay well and then you grab your
[31410.30s -> 31418.87s]  food and drive. Hey thank you over dramatic toast for the five dollars. Hey Jerma just
[31418.87s -> 31422.31s]  want to give some bits for all the laughs you've given my friends and I for the last seven
[31422.31s -> 31428.26s]  years. From tf2 commentaries to Jerma rumbles thanks man we're all lucky to have you. PS give
[31428.26s -> 31430.90s]  my bestie Nick and Johnny a good beer.
[31449.34s -> 31462.76s]  Fucking baby beer. Baby beer peed his diaper. Thank you over dramatic toast for the five
[31462.76s -> 31468.92s]  dollars. Thank you man. Dragora root for the five dollars and two cents. They just say pride
[31468.92s -> 31477.35s]  502. Thank you. P joke. He said P. He said P and diaper. Cross it off the list of things I say
[31477.35s -> 31480.63s]  every stream. Hey Garfield the Monday killer thanks for the one dollar. Hey there Jerma listen up.
[31481.69s -> 31487.77s]  It's Garfagraph time. Bring all your pups. I'm talking Otto Youngsoy and Francis too. He's
[31487.77s -> 31494.57s]  the first member of the GK crew. GK Garfy Kong. Garfy Kong is here. He's got no style.
[31494.57s -> 31498.97s]  He's got no grace. This dog's got a funny face. He can float real high and jump from
[31499.05s -> 31504.41s]  trees. He eats dog food and kicks bad guys knees. He's Odie. Odie and Odie too. He's the
[31504.41s -> 31509.13s]  second member of the GK crew. Huh I rapped too long and now there's no more Garfagraph left.
[31509.13s -> 31520.26s]  Oops. Thank you Garfield the Monday killer. Door cube thanks for the one dollar. We all know
[31520.26s -> 31525.22s]  that the Abyss Watchers are tough but we know you can do it and if anybody asks us
[31525.22s -> 31528.50s]  they'll tell them what a great job you're doing. You hear that? A great job. I didn't
[31528.50s -> 31540.26s]  do it though on first person. I did it in regular mode. Not even the power of a great
[31540.26s -> 31548.10s]  job could help. I may as well have been sitting upside down at that last point when I tried it on
[31548.10s -> 31556.98s]  invisible man mode. I was upside down. I was hanging upside down. Hey Jules thanks for the
[31556.98s -> 31559.78s]  three dollars. Hey Jeremy yesterday you answered my question saying that your favorite super
[31559.78s -> 31564.42s]  villain is Thanos and that your favorite superhero is Carnage. I couldn't find anything
[31564.42s -> 31568.10s]  from the internet that Carnage was a superhero at one point. Can you enlighten me? Thanks man.
[31569.06s -> 31580.70s]  No I said Carnage was my favorite super person. Superhero probably Spider-Man.
[31581.34s -> 31587.34s]  Just probably would be. Hey Pugatron thanks for the 15 dollars. There's no message here but
[31587.34s -> 31594.55s]  thank you for 15 dollars. It's a lot of fucking money. Some of you guys give 15 dollars almost
[31594.55s -> 31601.72s]  every single stream and it adds up to a lot of money. Thank you. Palasonic thanks for the
[31601.72s -> 31604.60s]  one dollar. Hey Jeremy last April you gave some advice on stream of getting out of a
[31604.60s -> 31609.80s]  dark place by making other people happy that really resonated with me. I've always wanted to
[31609.80s -> 31614.12s]  be an EMT or something like that so I joined the army as a combat medic. I finished up all
[31614.12s -> 31618.68s]  my training helping people and seeing how proud and happy my family is is the best feeling.
[31618.68s -> 31626.28s]  Thank you for that advice. It changed my life. That is fucking wonderful to hear.
[31627.58s -> 31638.34s]  Absolutely wonderful. If anything that I say can help you out. That's that's life changing
[31638.34s -> 31652.49s]  for me. It blows me away. Thank you so much for being around. If the stuff that I say can help
[31652.49s -> 31662.44s]  you out in your life. I mean I'm no professional. I'm not qualified to really give advice
[31663.24s -> 31669.62s]  but it does feel good to know that somebody's happier because of it. So
[31670.26s -> 31693.24s]  I'm glad you're doing good. Thank you. For real. Good luck to you. Much luck to you.
[31694.82s -> 31705.26s]  Here here I still got like a little bit of wine in this glass. Cheers. Cheers to you. Hey Tingy
[31705.26s -> 31710.76s]  thanks for the one dollar. Jeremy your doctor calling is worried about you. You should really
[31710.76s -> 31714.44s]  take a break from games that boil your blood. It's not good for your heart. Remember that you
[31714.44s -> 31725.64s]  have a pacemaker. Jeremy old. I told you it was coming. Hey FGW thanks for the five dollars.
[31725.64s -> 31729.40s]  Oh Jeremy I forgot to tell you Twitch ended up refunding my bits that I got mistakenly
[31729.40s -> 31737.18s]  charged for and you got to keep the money according to the email. Well that's I'm glad
[31737.18s -> 31741.74s]  that they did that. I'm glad you got your money back. Also I'm a red bits badge now and it's been
[31741.74s -> 31746.46s]  worth every penny. Sorry Avis Watchers gave you so much trouble. My grandfather had a rough time
[31746.46s -> 31759.40s]  with that boss too. Just messing around you the best. Thank you FGW. I did it the first
[31761.40s -> 31766.36s]  the first time when I had no invisibility and no first person. I did it the first time
[31766.36s -> 31775.70s]  I went in there. I'm so I'm so itchy knowing that I didn't beat that in first person.
[31775.70s -> 31782.97s]  It was I was locked in. I had to beat it in first person and then I lost all control. Well
[31782.97s -> 31790.44s]  not really. I was it was still fun. I wouldn't have kept going in there if it wasn't. But
[31790.44s -> 31797.03s]  thank you NotVega for the five dollars. Just pogchamp. Sir Tardigrad thanks for the one
[31797.11s -> 31799.67s]  dollar. Hey Jerma today my friends all made plans to smash.
[31805.43s -> 31808.71s]  Hey Jerma today my friends all made plans to play smash.
[31814.36s -> 31820.02s]  I'm sorry. I'm fucking stupid. Hey Jerma today my friends all made plans to play smash
[31820.02s -> 31824.42s]  and hang out without me. Feels bad but fuck them anyway. Great to get
[31824.42s -> 31827.14s]  home and see you playing one of my favorite games. Why why would they do that?
[31831.67s -> 31845.86s]  What what's up with that? Why'd they do that? Is it a wait hold on is it a scenario where
[31846.74s -> 31859.42s]  you're really damn good? Like they're all playing fucks because they heard it was good
[31859.42s -> 31870.65s]  and you're playing this like Olimar and just stomping them. Yeah but if that people don't
[31870.65s -> 31881.90s]  want to play a game with you and hang out with you that's that's not fucking cool man. Is
[31881.90s -> 31897.53s]  Olimar top tier into ultimate? Really? Maybe I'm too good. I do stomp. Well um I would say
[31898.41s -> 31907.27s]  we're glad to have you. Glad to have you watch me uh have a fucking stream meltdown
[31907.99s -> 31919.93s]  at first person to this watchers for like an hour and a half. But for real if uh if people
[31919.93s -> 31923.85s]  want to exclude you from playing a game and hanging out with them for some reason
[31924.49s -> 31933.13s]  maybe reconsider who they are. Maybe reconsider some friendships because that's the that doesn't
[31933.13s -> 31943.58s]  seem very very cool. But I wish you luck. Thank you. Thank you suspicious lettuce for
[31943.58s -> 31947.34s]  the ten dollars. It's nice to see some of your stream. It's always a treat in Europe.
[31948.14s -> 31958.55s]  Thank you suspicious lettuce for the ten dollars and the European message. Doomed RS thanks for
[31958.55s -> 31962.71s]  three dollars you brought up Andre at max speed but he didn't make the cut so I felt obligated
[31962.71s -> 31968.90s]  to direct you to this work of video art. You're going to love this. Trust me. What you're
[31968.90s -> 31974.66s]  seeing now is my normal state. This is what is known as a super saiyan that has ascended
[31974.66s -> 31996.87s]  past a super saiyan and that's why there we are. Too bad I thought you guys wanted me to fight
[31996.87s -> 32003.78s]  him. Hey plastic glue thanks for the one dollar. Tingy for one dollar. Baby bf for germa rumble.
[32004.97s -> 32008.65s]  Maybe I don't think so. Doomed RS thanks for the one dollar. Put a link in my last donation
[32008.65s -> 32014.74s]  but a nightbot killed it since I wasn't subbed. I'm a subscriber now. Welcome to the subs.
[32014.74s -> 32018.26s]  Anyway you mentioned Andre at max speed. Oh we got it. No we got it. We did get it
[32018.98s -> 32023.11s]  because I get to save on I get to save every message that comes through.
[32027.02s -> 32037.99s]  Please link. Here's the link. Thank you doomed for the two dollars. And finally Iammonk thanks
[32037.99s -> 32040.71s]  for the one dollar. I'm trying to get over being an alcoholic and your streams and
[32040.71s -> 32046.55s]  community is something I can't get through with this without. I love you all. Germahart.
[32047.27s -> 32060.78s]  Good luck. Keep your head up. That's the wrong link. What is that a link to?
[32064.68s -> 32071.96s]  I fucked it up. Whatever. But Iammonk you get all the support in the world from
[32072.60s -> 32085.61s]  me and this community. Take care of yourself. One step at a time. Good luck.
[32086.25s -> 32105.69s]  You got a whole community here. Thank you for the one dollar and thanks for being around.
[32108.87s -> 32117.56s]  Finally finally clueless sniper with one dollar at the very end. Thank you clueless sniper.
[32119.77s -> 32122.41s]  And it wouldn't be the end of a stream without the credits so let's see
[32123.37s -> 32133.26s]  all those subs flying on by. Finish the stream with an English lesson of course we will.
[32140.47s -> 32147.40s]  We eat a lot. Did you see my car keys? They're on top of the tv. You're right. Thanks.
[32147.40s -> 32153.24s]  Where are you going? To the supermarket. Again? Yes we eat a lot. Do you want me to go with
[32153.24s -> 32158.12s]  you? Sure if you can. Good. The packages will be heavy. There is a new health store right
[32158.12s -> 32162.28s]  up the road. Maybe since you guys eat a lot you should try and eat more healthily.
[32162.28s -> 32167.96s]  Maybe you're right. We have all put on a little weight. Who puts their keys on? I know why would
[32167.96s -> 32176.84s]  you put your keys on top of the tv? But there's there was a lot of people here. There was almost
[32176.84s -> 32181.96s]  four thousand people here up until about midnight pacific time. Thanks for sticking around.
[32182.76s -> 32198.15s]  The stream has fucking grown so much I can't even believe it. Looking over at like 11 30
[32198.15s -> 32205.69s]  12 o'clock pacific time and seeing a number like four thousand. It's it's crazy to me.
[32205.69s -> 32226.94s]  Thank you guys and I will see you all again really soon. Specifically on Monday for either
[32228.31s -> 32233.91s]  for either Lifeline for PlayStation 2 which is a microphone controlled game
[32235.29s -> 32252.26s]  or Back to Dragon's Dogma or Dreamcast or it's pretty much it. He will continue to push
[32252.26s -> 32266.65s]  Dreamcast. Dreamcast has been in the work since Monster Hunter 3's stream. I've
[32266.65s -> 32273.30s]  I've owned it since the Monster Hunter 3 streams but I run into some nonsense with it.
[32274.02s -> 32278.90s]  I talked about it last stream but we'll bring it up while the credits play out here.
[32280.18s -> 32286.18s]  Dreamcast games are insanely expensive. They're very rare and a lot of the good ones are
[32286.18s -> 32294.26s]  somewhere around 100 bucks each. All the classic games have been ported to PC
[32297.43s -> 32305.30s]  and on top of that there is emulation but emulators are very unreliable. So capturing
[32305.30s -> 32312.42s]  an emulator and playing it on Dreamcast emulator is really not ideal. Did you get Power Stone? I do
[32312.42s -> 32318.71s]  have Power Stone. I got a couple of the really really good interesting survival horror games
[32318.71s -> 32324.41s]  that were only on Dreamcast. Power Stone, Dynamite Cop which is one of my favorite arcade
[32324.41s -> 32339.48s]  games ever. There are there are some options but stuff like Shenmue and Crazy Taxi and
[32339.48s -> 32345.94s]  Space Channel 5 they're all on PC. Shenmue and Shenmue 2 got ported to PC not even
[32345.94s -> 32352.47s]  like six months ago. So it's like eh do you spend a bunch of money on the Dreamcast version
[32352.47s -> 32359.19s]  that's not even in 1080 720p or get the updated ported PC one and play that instead?
[32359.19s -> 32374.78s]  But that's gonna be it. Thank you for joining me. I had a lot of fun as much as I went into
[32374.78s -> 32380.14s]  pure fucking streamer meltdown mode. I didn't. I didn't. I still was having a good time even
[32380.14s -> 32389.30s]  though I was talking about how how hard it was. I still had a lot of fun. You guys rock. See you
[32389.30s -> 32395.18s]  guys on Monday. Have a great rest of your weekend. Take care of yourselves. See you very soon.
