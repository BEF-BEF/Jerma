[1.53s -> 13.67s]  Hi there, welcome. Hope everybody's having a good post-Christmas, post-holiday here.
[14.79s -> 27.35s]  Relaxation day. Do have New Years coming up in just a few days, but I had a good Christmas.
[30.46s -> 41.83s]  I did some FaceTime with the family, which is always good. Yeah, I miss them, but it was fun.
[42.47s -> 49.64s]  The house here, I decided to give a few gifts to each other. Pretty wholesome day, and then
[49.64s -> 58.02s]  I just sat on the couch, watched TV and played video games, and ate snacks. It was pretty much
[58.02s -> 73.27s]  my whole day. So today into tonight, we are going to play this game called Kenshi. This is a game
[73.27s -> 83.45s]  about survival. It's like a wasteland kind of survival game that has top-down RTS, RPG,
[83.45s -> 87.29s]  hybrid, squad-based. There's a whole lot of crazy shit that can happen in this game,
[87.93s -> 94.31s]  so I figured I would give it a try. This game is going to be too hard for you.
[95.48s -> 105.10s]  That's fine. I did read a few things about it. This game is designed for you to just lose,
[105.82s -> 115.58s]  so by its very design choices, you're supposed to fucking lose. You can read? Yeah, I just
[115.58s -> 124.38s]  learned. I got this book, How to Read, and I started at the beginning, and now I finished
[124.38s -> 133.10s]  the book and I can read, but give me one second. We'll get started. I got the game ready to go. I
[133.10s -> 187.50s]  just need to grab one thing. See you in two seconds. How did you read the book that taught
[187.50s -> 194.76s]  you how to read? I've read it. It was very easy at first. Starting off each page, it's about
[194.76s -> 202.38s]  a four to five hundred page book, and the first page is just big symbols of animals,
[203.56s -> 207.16s]  and you know, I know what that is. It shows you an elephant. I know that's what an elephant
[207.16s -> 211.72s]  is, and then you turn the next page and there's an E there. It's a giant E.
[212.60s -> 219.58s]  So, okay, I know what E is. I know what the letter E is, and the next page shows the elephant
[219.58s -> 229.16s]  again, and it puts E-L, and then by the time you get to chapter 10, you know in appliances
[229.16s -> 235.42s]  what they are and how to call them what they are. At the end of the book, the Great Gatsby
[235.42s -> 240.50s]  is in the book. They just put it at the end, so eventually you get there and you can read
[240.50s -> 250.17s]  the Great Gatsby. It's really cool. Let's get started. What do you say? Let's turn this
[250.17s -> 261.34s]  music on, turn this off, and here is Kenshi. So I don't really know much about this. All
[261.34s -> 264.70s]  I know is it's gonna be fucking hard, and it's gonna be a difficult video game,
[264.70s -> 268.71s]  but it should be fun as a character creator, and you know how much I love those things.
[268.71s -> 277.43s]  Let's go to the new game. All right, uh, choose your beginning. Wanderer, nobody's,
[277.43s -> 284.18s]  wanderer, the wandering trader, the holy sword, the cannibal hunter, the hive exile,
[284.18s -> 293.48s]  son of a captain, the slaves, rock bottom, empire citizen, holy nation citizen, guy with a dog.
[294.76s -> 304.66s]  Okay, I kind of like, I kind of like guy with a dog. Okay, difficulty is normal. I have, uh,
[305.85s -> 309.96s]  I have a source on Wikipedia for the amount of money that I have,
[309.96s -> 314.68s]  and the play style is RPG. A homeless and hungry drifter rescues an abandoned puppy.
[314.68s -> 320.44s]  It seems pretty useless. Maybe he will just eat it. Holy shit, that's the, I don't know if I want
[320.44s -> 328.92s]  to eat a dog. Okay, um, I don't think I want to eat a dog, but what else we got? RPG, RPG,
[328.92s -> 336.58s]  what are these other play styles? Action RPG, difficulty dodgy. I seriously regret coming into
[336.58s -> 341.14s]  cannibal territory. This is a stupid idea. Warning, you will be attacked immediately upon
[341.14s -> 348.15s]  game start. Not recommended for a first-time play. This is hard. I'm not ready for the
[348.15s -> 359.35s]  hard stuff. The wandering trader. No, I don't want to do a trading RPG. Nobody's easy,
[359.35s -> 365.59s]  easy and hard combination. Guy with a dog. I'm not going to do rock bottom. You've hit
[365.59s -> 370.47s]  absolute rock bottom. You are alone, unarmed, naked and hungry, lost in the middle of a harsh
[370.47s -> 377.03s]  desert, teeming with slavers, and you just lost an arm. Good luck. You want me to start
[377.03s -> 385.90s]  here after I've never played this game before. And you want me to start here.
[385.90s -> 390.30s]  We can only go up from here. All right, fine. Advanced options, hunger time. I'm not
[390.30s -> 402.90s]  going to mess with any of these. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Okay. This is called rock bottom.
[406.58s -> 415.16s]  Heavy inventory will slow you down, but it's a good way to hold the middle mouse to rotate
[415.16s -> 422.36s]  the guy. I have to make my character create your first character. Use the confirm button
[422.36s -> 431.59s]  when finished. Yeah, but I do. I'm all right. Idle stance. We can make him golem
[432.15s -> 450.15s]  the straight up standing. I kind of want number two. I like this one. I know everybody's going
[450.15s -> 459.02s]  to want me to do this one. I'm going to go with this one. This is fine. Height.
[462.73s -> 475.78s]  Just make it stretched out guy. I'm just going to take a squid. All right. So Frank
[475.78s -> 485.91s]  posture. I'm going to turn into a human bow and arrow. All right. I know that's too
[485.91s -> 499.42s]  extreme. Okay. I already love this game and I haven't even played it. All right.
[499.42s -> 509.16s]  But how do I shoulder set this so much here? What do you think? All the way back
[511.10s -> 517.66s]  or all the way? No, we'll just do this. I got a really bad nerd neck and all. I got
[517.66s -> 523.50s]  to change the leg length. Oh, we go. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[523.50s -> 530.65s]  I like this one because this is just realistic enough. Shoulder set. I'm going to say
[531.45s -> 539.77s]  tight together. Uh, yeah. Down like this neck position. Let's see.
[543.80s -> 555.93s]  It's like a bird. How could you? You can't have a fully side. Can you make a,
[555.93s -> 558.17s]  if you're the developer of this game, can you pick a wrestling game?
[558.97s -> 566.36s]  You know what I mean? Like if you do have the necessary resources to make a wrestling game.
[566.36s -> 575.85s]  All right. Uh, leg length. Let's go with this one. He's going to be really tall.
[576.65s -> 595.78s]  Shoulders tight together. Arm bulk. Oh my Lord. Hands. You have big hands. No,
[595.78s -> 599.78s]  huge hands. It's too easy. Tiny hands. Does this affect how hard I punch?
[604.18s -> 617.38s]  Chest. No, we're just making a seahorse. Um, bring it down. Stomach.
[622.74s -> 629.91s]  How tall is this? How tall is he? I don't even know how tall, but this guy's like
[629.91s -> 649.18s]  nine feet tall. Just give him like a big diaper ass. All right. Leg shape. You need to have
[649.18s -> 656.97s]  him top heavy or bottom heavy. That looks pretty good anymore. There. Okay. This feet.
[657.61s -> 674.62s]  Those feet are fine. All right. Face. Holy shit. Oh boy. This. Look at all this. Really.
[676.20s -> 693.85s]  Oh neck. Oh, you could do. It looks like somebody's arm is up in a sock. This is a sock
[693.85s -> 704.68s]  puppet person. Neck width. This is just unsettling is what it is. Neck length.
[705.32s -> 718.81s]  It can be even longer than that. Jaw. Cheekbones. I guess we could go this way.
[724.01s -> 729.37s]  You can go either width. Oh, it just looks like, it's just like, like Greg House.
[730.01s -> 744.46s]  Wilson. I, uh, you know, I can't do a doctor house. Maybe I can. No, I can't. Is there a
[744.46s -> 758.65s]  character named Wilson in the game? Not the game. In the show? Yeah, there is. Okay. Looks
[758.65s -> 785.45s]  all right. Arch. Let's see. Oh dear. This guy's not going to survive. You say that. Just
[785.45s -> 799.86s]  wait till he does. What's the, uh, what's that animal from? What's the ice age character?
[800.50s -> 815.30s]  The squirrel. No, not the Grinch. Definitely has to have kind of mad eyes. Yeah, that's sad
[815.30s -> 820.39s]  and surprised. This is very upset. No, not that upset. That's a little too much for me.
[821.11s -> 831.59s]  Can have his eyes bugging at his head. Now he's very concerned. That's good.
[834.17s -> 848.41s]  Mmm. Two, no, right there's all right. It's kind of got the Homer Simpson. All right. No,
[848.41s -> 859.67s]  that looks all right. Eye height. Aye yi yi. All right, do we want him to have more face or
[859.67s -> 869.38s]  more head? I think more head. Didn't you already make this video? Yeah, but the only
[869.38s -> 875.18s]  difference is there are no mods on this. Eye size. This is just straight up out of the box.
[875.90s -> 887.27s]  Oh man, look at, you can go all the way in. What do you think? In or in? Yeah, it's got to be in.
[887.99s -> 898.86s]  It's that. All right. Wait, hold on. I did this other. What the fuck? Wait, hold on.
[899.66s -> 924.26s]  There's so many creatures. Why did I not know this existed? So this is the best game ever.
[924.26s -> 928.26s]  You're telling me that I can make other. Okay, hold on. Go back, go back, go back,
[928.58s -> 943.53s]  go back. This is really important. He's gone. Are you sure about that?
[945.59s -> 958.46s]  That was very surprising. He's fine. Oh, no, I can't have a guy be a butterfly. Shouldn't he be a
[958.46s -> 967.77s]  butterfly? All right. Guy, butterfly. Oh, he's the contortionist. This guy's going to be
[968.49s -> 971.45s]  one like America's Got Talent and try to fit himself into a box.
[976.01s -> 985.54s]  Okay. It can't be this. That's too much. He has to at least be able to stand. Okay. So
[986.42s -> 998.50s]  there are, look at, do you see how many people I can make? All right. Perfect. Hair. Hair. Haircut
[998.50s -> 1007.22s]  four. I don't want to see any others. I don't think I should see any others.
[1007.22s -> 1014.74s]  I don't want to change it, but I kind of have to. Let's do it. Okay, hold on. What
[1014.74s -> 1051.98s]  about beards? No, it has to be the, it has to be that one little swoop over. That's it. 40.
[1052.78s -> 1072.52s]  Was it like six or seven? He just looks like any currently airing animated 3D boss of the
[1072.52s -> 1077.32s]  main character. And all those like 3D animated shows that are currently airing, this is like
[1077.80s -> 1092.55s]  the character's boss. Always. Okay. Beard. There's a lot of beard options. So hold on.
[1095.50s -> 1102.17s]  I love how this is just pasted on right here. That's clearly a fake beard. No, that's too easy.
[1102.97s -> 1116.30s]  That's all. That's too easy too. I mean, this is so easy, right? But I can, no,
[1116.30s -> 1125.91s]  I got to get rid of that. The way it was before. That's actually not bad.
[1128.33s -> 1130.17s]  Oh, you can do different hair color. Okay.
[1146.25s -> 1155.30s]  The Joker. No, I can't make him like a YouTuber. There we go.
[1158.01s -> 1160.57s]  Okay. This is like what happens when you dye your hair too many times.
[1161.29s -> 1172.98s]  So it looks good. I think that's good. Confirm.
[1174.47s -> 1178.71s]  Primarily from farmer cultures, they still tend to be an aggressive race and they're easily led
[1178.71s -> 1183.03s]  astray. The worst of them live in ignorance, knowing only greed and fear, reacting to
[1183.03s -> 1186.15s]  anything different with hatred and violence. But the best of them are some of the greatest
[1186.15s -> 1195.46s]  civilized scientists, engineers, and warriors in the land. Humans. Yeah, okay. What is,
[1195.46s -> 1203.75s]  what is that? I think I, I think we got our character. I'm ready. Confirm.
[1206.66s -> 1214.79s]  Naked dude. The great desert. Oh, this is elaborate. Okay. Basic controls.
[1216.15s -> 1220.87s]  You can move the camera with WASD to rotate your view. Hold the middle mouse button.
[1220.87s -> 1227.22s]  Okay. To zoom, use the mouse scroll. Okay. Where am I supposed to go?
[1229.40s -> 1234.12s]  I'm actually in the middle of the desert. Okay. The middle, the middle bottom panel shows
[1234.12s -> 1239.72s]  the character in your active squad. To select a squad member, left click the character on the
[1239.72s -> 1250.20s]  icon. Select the squad, left click the character icon on the panel. Okay. To give
[1250.92s -> 1258.73s]  a move order to your character, right click on the terrain. Easy. Double click on your
[1258.73s -> 1266.97s]  character icon to center on the screen and follow their movement. All right. So I can
[1266.97s -> 1273.29s]  hold. All right. Cool. You can hold it. Right click on characters or interactable objects
[1273.29s -> 1279.61s]  to interact. Hold the right mouse button on to get more available actions. Okay. So
[1280.92s -> 1286.44s]  I see. Why is it? Okay. I don't have a name. Splint injuries. I don't have a splint
[1286.44s -> 1299.11s]  kit. Okay. Basic controls. That's done. Move around like this. I didn't name him.
[1299.11s -> 1310.42s]  Okay. So we got that done. Overview. This shows your selection's current state,
[1310.42s -> 1314.50s]  statistics, and other basic info. Mouse over each item for more information. Okay.
[1315.70s -> 1322.73s]  Naked dude nameless. That's his first, middle, and last name. State normal, goal aimless.
[1325.02s -> 1331.82s]  No, no encumbrance. Martial arts? Minus nine. Strength zero, dexterity zero,
[1331.82s -> 1341.51s]  toughness one, dodge one. Okay. Interesting. So it's your dodge skill, your toughness skill.
[1341.51s -> 1346.71s]  Interesting. All right. What is this? Athletics XP. This is the rate at which your athletic skill
[1346.71s -> 1353.27s]  is increasing while running. Cool. This is the rate at which your strength is increasing. It's
[1353.27s -> 1361.99s]  zero percent toughness. Six times. Bleed multiplier. Head. Your head is okay. Your chest
[1361.99s -> 1368.71s]  is okay. Your stomach is okay. Your left arm, your limb is gone forever. Your right arm is okay.
[1368.71s -> 1372.87s]  Your left leg, everything's okay. And you are getting a little hungry. You're suffering from
[1372.87s -> 1376.87s]  malnutrition. Your stats and strength will be affected. You need to get some food as soon
[1376.87s -> 1387.24s]  as possible. Stat penalty is at times 88, .88. Okay. So now what? No jobs. To add jobs
[1387.24s -> 1392.79s]  holds shift when giving an order. Continue. This shows the selected character's current
[1392.79s -> 1397.11s]  health condition. Yeah, I figured that out. The arrow buttons allow you to pause and fast
[1397.11s -> 1410.30s]  forward the game speed. Pause. Got it. Okay. That's actually pretty cool. So this is just
[1410.30s -> 1415.94s]  like The Sims, but in a wasteland. This is awesome. Here you'll find your character's
[1415.94s -> 1424.70s]  current funds and the in-game time and date. Nothing. And this is the day and the time.
[1425.34s -> 1436.30s]  Okay. This opens the build menu. There's a build menu? Here you can place buildings
[1436.30s -> 1440.86s]  and start your own outpost anywhere in the world, but you should choose a safe area and
[1440.86s -> 1446.54s]  check availability of resources using the prospect button. You will also need building materials to
[1446.54s -> 1461.43s]  finish construction. Okay. So I need to prospect something first. Buildings. Small shack.
[1465.56s -> 1468.84s]  Building material? What do I have for building? Am I just going to make like a
[1468.84s -> 1484.26s]  fucking trash box? Should I just build a fucking cube? No, no, that's a bad place for that.
[1485.06s -> 1488.10s]  It's in the middle of the desert. I can't even get running water out there. All right.
[1488.10s -> 1494.18s]  That's the build menu. You can open your inventory. What is it? I'm in the build menu.
[1494.18s -> 1501.24s]  Shit. I got to get out of the build menu. Out. Okay. Here you can open your inventory,
[1501.24s -> 1505.00s]  skill statistics, world map, tech and squad management. For tips and tutorials,
[1505.00s -> 1510.31s]  make sure to check out the help menu at the very bottom. Character's inventory.
[1510.79s -> 1518.34s]  Oh, this is so cool. Limbs. Well, that's what I'm holding on my arms. Total weight.
[1519.06s -> 1534.71s]  Disguise. Okay. Status window. Toughness. Max carry weight. Dexterity. All right.
[1535.51s -> 1538.15s]  This is a lot. Look it up. There's a lot. There's an open world map.
[1538.71s -> 1553.61s]  What? What's that noise? I'm paused, right? Dude, this is, this is bigger than Northrend.
[1553.69s -> 1560.02s]  Okay, there's a city over here. Sho Bataille is over here. I got to make it over to the city,
[1560.02s -> 1572.14s]  I'm assuming. Okay. Well, there's a couple of cities. There's bark, sho bataille, heft and
[1572.14s -> 1585.08s]  stroat. Okay. Faction. Dust bandits, slave hunters, research, crafting. How to research
[1585.08s -> 1597.59s]  squad. Dialogue. What? Did that, was that, what was that dialogue? All right. I'm going to
[1597.59s -> 1604.79s]  make it to, okay. I got, I got the basics down. This shows the jobs and orders for the selected
[1604.79s -> 1612.76s]  character. Jobs. No jobs. The job is make it to the city. Your character is hungry, missing a
[1612.76s -> 1618.14s]  limb. What do I do? There is no linear story or mission to guide you in Kenshi. Be a trader,
[1618.14s -> 1621.98s]  a thief, a bounty hunter, a farmer, or even a warlord. You'll need to explore the world and
[1621.98s -> 1626.54s]  find your own adventure. Tap the M key. You can use the world map to navigate and
[1626.54s -> 1637.77s]  find nearby towns or points of interest. So M, right, is the key. Oops. There we go.
[1639.29s -> 1645.37s]  Is a true open world. First things first, you need food and funds to survive. To get
[1645.37s -> 1648.97s]  started, you can either scavenge the outlands for loot, mine valuable materials from iron
[1648.97s -> 1653.45s]  ore veins, or you can even resort to thievery after nightfall. To cash in your loot,
[1653.45s -> 1657.37s]  you need to find a store. Use the map to navigate to a nearby town and find shops.
[1658.01s -> 1661.77s]  Surviving alone in the world of Kenshi won't be easy, but hiring new recruits will help.
[1661.77s -> 1667.53s]  Check the town bars for mercs or buy animal companions from any of the farms outside town.
[1667.53s -> 1671.85s]  Remember, you're not special and you're not stronger than anyone else. Train hard,
[1671.85s -> 1674.57s]  pick your fights wisely, and don't be afraid to run like crazy.
[1676.70s -> 1684.66s]  All right. What do you say? Huh? I'm ready to get started. Let's just go find a town.
[1684.66s -> 1687.90s]  You know what I mean? Let's go.
[1687.90s -> 1688.38s]  Give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give
[1744.52s -> 1827.88s]  it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it
[1827.88s -> 1920.31s]  a, juggernaut. Ow. God damn it. Where's my health. I'm going the wrong way. Quick, Bangal- Bangal tilt. Come on, where is the town? I'm not close to a town. I'm so far away from this place. Chest. Stomach. Lee- okay, I've still got had a pretty good head on my shoulders though. This is actually kind of brutal. This is nothing I can do about this. Don't fuck with us. I didn't, you came after me. Naked dude has been enslaved. Jobs, obedient slave. Uh alright. Leave him alone. Right I'm trying
[1920.31s -> 1934.71s]  Do I get up? What is he doing to me? He's been doing this for a really long time.
[1934.71s -> 1944.06s]  Your character is hung, you need food to survive. You can grow food, buy it, hunt it, or steal it.
[1944.06s -> 1946.86s]  Your squad will automatically eat whatever food is in their inventory.
[1946.86s -> 1953.14s]  So am I getting brought into a squad? He's healing me. This guy just let me in his squad.
[1955.70s -> 1958.42s]  All right, you appear to be missing a limb. Limbs are useful things to have,
[1958.42s -> 1961.22s]  so you may want to get that replaced. You can buy various robotic limbs.
[1962.02s -> 1968.04s]  Okay, install new limbs using the robotics. Robotic limbs require skeleton repair kits.
[1968.04s -> 1974.57s]  Okay, he actually is healing me. This is great. Building gates and walls. When building walls,
[1974.57s -> 1978.73s]  you need to be careful not to place them facing inside out. The arrows you see show the outside
[1978.73s -> 1985.26s]  facing direction. You can use the and buttons to rotate before placing them. As with other
[1985.26s -> 1988.62s]  buildings, you can only place them when they glow green. Yep, once you're happy, left click
[1988.62s -> 2000.23s]  to set it down. You got it. What the fuck? How do I like keep centered on myself?
[2008.58s -> 2021.96s]  Where's the camp? Double click your icon. Okay, there we go. Right. Well, he folded me up
[2021.96s -> 2025.40s]  like a blanket. I guess we're just going to be with this guy now. Okay.
[2026.28s -> 2029.88s]  Oh, fine. I'll just read tutorials while you walk me around. That's good. Welcome to build
[2029.88s -> 2035.27s]  mode. Uh, boo. Yep. Select the building and get a building a small shack will allow you
[2035.27s -> 2040.15s]  to build a research bench. That's $50 that came in by and I can't even see because
[2040.15s -> 2043.67s]  the text is so small. I don't know what I did. Something from the Christmas Eve stream.
[2044.47s -> 2053.67s]  I'm unconscious. Well, look at where at least we're going 12 miles per hour. This guy can
[2053.67s -> 2062.82s]  run pretty fast. Uh, but first of all, thank you to soup set for the $50. Happy late Christmas
[2062.82s -> 2071.26s]  big boy. Thank you. You as well. Thank you so much for the $50. Wait, hold on. I gotta
[2071.26s -> 2078.01s]  pay attention. Wait, are we just catching up with me? We're just catching up with the other
[2078.01s -> 2090.33s]  people. What is that? Don't trip over that. Those are his buddies. This is his. Yeah,
[2090.33s -> 2113.45s]  this is the squad. Hey, what's up guys? Yeah. I'm the new squad member. I'm not really,
[2114.09s -> 2128.79s]  I'm not really doing anything. Am I just pretend it's an online game? Yeah. It can't
[2128.79s -> 2137.54s]  isn't it? Doesn't this happen in some of these online RPGs? Building a shack will
[2137.54s -> 2141.94s]  allow you to build a research bench inside. You can learn new techniques, new shoes,
[2141.94s -> 2144.74s]  where to place a building on the terrain. Yes. Yes. Yes. Rotate the position using
[2144.74s -> 2148.26s]  the and keys. Yeah. Select squad members and right click the construction to begin
[2148.26s -> 2153.48s]  adding materials if they have them. Right. Much quicker depending on the number. Just
[2153.48s -> 2156.68s]  like in Warcraft, the more orcs you put on the building, the more they could build it.
[2157.40s -> 2162.68s]  How to craft. You are injured. You are under attack. Use the spacebar to pause the action.
[2162.68s -> 2166.20s]  This would give you some time to think and plan your next step. When you're outnumbered,
[2166.20s -> 2169.56s]  it may be best to jump ship and flee. If you choose to flee, right click on the terrain
[2169.56s -> 2174.12s]  to move your character. Make sure you have your character selected. If you do choose
[2174.12s -> 2177.72s]  to stand and fight, select your squad members, hold right click on the target enemy and
[2177.72s -> 2184.62s]  select attack target. OT attack all from the interaction menu. Just right clicking on an
[2184.62s -> 2188.46s]  enemy when the cursor is red also gives you an attack order. Okay. That's, that's what I
[2188.46s -> 2194.07s]  thought. You can also, you can select more specific combat modes from the right side
[2194.07s -> 2199.67s]  command menu. Block focuses on defense over attack. Passive focuses on non-combat.
[2200.47s -> 2205.03s]  Chases focuses on chasing down enemies. Taunt focuses on drawing enemy attacks.
[2206.95s -> 2210.23s]  You've been enslaved. You can either live out the rest of your life as a slave or
[2210.23s -> 2215.26s]  you can break free and escape. Your character will automatically behave obediently to their master.
[2215.26s -> 2219.98s]  If you want to escape, you'll need to dismiss the obedience slave auto job by pressing the
[2219.98s -> 2236.58s]  X. Okay. Let's go. I'm out. You can then hold right click on your character to bring up the
[2236.58s -> 2243.94s]  interaction menu and unlock your shackles to escape. Careful even if you escape successfully,
[2243.94s -> 2257.56s]  you're branded a slave. Oh, I'm unconscious. Just unlock your shackles. All right. I think
[2257.56s -> 2262.26s]  we got it. You are KO'd. You've been knocked out. If seriously wounded, the unconscious
[2262.34s -> 2266.26s]  status will change to dying and the character won't get back up until healed by another character.
[2266.26s -> 2269.93s]  If they don't get first aid in time, they'll eventually die, which is what we saw.
[2269.93s -> 2274.81s]  Even after healing, a character will need time to recover before regaining consciousness.
[2274.81s -> 2279.05s]  Particularly bad injuries will enter the character into a recovery coma until their
[2279.05s -> 2288.55s]  vitals happen. What the fuck is happening? Is he using me as a weapon out of a it's
[2288.55s -> 2302.98s]  come on it's a jailbreak ghetto. Is there animals? What is this like a pig dog? Come
[2302.98s -> 2312.20s]  on. Come on. Break free. Break free. Come on. Where did the dog just go?
[2315.62s -> 2325.50s]  That guy went up into the sky apparently. What was this powerful? They did it. They saved me.
[2326.60s -> 2353.48s]  Thanks for the rescue. Hello? Uh, hello? You know, check. I'm still alive down here.
[2353.48s -> 2365.85s]  I could use some help. What was the point of that? So there's just another army of
[2365.93s -> 2379.80s]  raiders. What are these? Okay, hold on up. I'm still, I'm gonna be just fine. This is perfect.
[2379.80s -> 2390.25s]  Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. Why are they getting up? Why are they getting up?
[2390.25s -> 2397.16s]  No, no, I just don't, don't come get me. Come on. He's running. I think this is a
[2397.16s -> 2412.17s]  perfect opportunity. No, they're looting each other. No, I really don't understand. They're
[2412.17s -> 2416.63s]  looting the dead bodies. Are they just going to, are they going to forget that I exist?
[2417.35s -> 2432.63s]  Because I'm technically unconscious. 1700 more seconds. No, they're healing each other.
[2434.12s -> 2439.13s]  Something's going on over here. Uh, that doesn't look like it's very appealing.
[2439.93s -> 2451.72s]  Yeah, they're gonna forget about me. Let's fast forward. 1600. Hold on. Yep. Wait,
[2451.72s -> 2459.34s]  what'd he say? Wow, wow, wow. What'd he say? Walk right over me. Come on. Oh my fucking god.
[2460.22s -> 2477.45s]  It's like it never happened. Is this dangerous? I feel like these sandstorms are dangerous.
[2483.06s -> 2499.75s]  Well, I got another 1600 seconds. What? Wait, why is there a giant bunk? Hold on a second.
[2500.47s -> 2515.66s]  Get off of this. Hold on. What is this? Put me down. Why are you just standing there with my
[2515.66s -> 2549.54s]  body? Where did I go? Why am I still bouncing around? And with my daring escape. Did they
[2549.54s -> 2565.90s]  kill it? No. How did you kill this thing? Can I please just get to a town? How much more time do
[2565.90s -> 2578.95s]  I have? 1400 seconds. They forgot about me. This is my perfect opportunity to lie here and
[2578.95s -> 2584.23s]  just be dead. They don't care about me. I went too far. They forgot. They thought I died.
[2584.23s -> 2596.49s]  Perfect. Don't remember. Come on. Just keep going that way. No, no, no, no, no. No.
[2598.65s -> 2605.58s]  Just walk by my body. Don't come over here. It's too dusty. You can't even see anyways.
[2605.58s -> 2625.61s]  I think we're in the clear. I just have to sit here for 1300 seconds. All right. We'll make our
[2625.61s -> 2633.35s]  escape very soon. I can unlock my shackles. Nobody around, right? No giant bugs. All right,
[2633.35s -> 2644.14s]  here we go. I just need to wait this out. And then I'm going to eat that bug. I can eat the
[2644.14s -> 2661.30s]  bug, right? Bug is back up. How can I? I can't eat that. Can I eat some of these things? The
[2661.30s -> 2672.26s]  bug's not going to see me if I stand up. What's like the view distance? I think the bug died.
[2672.26s -> 2690.82s]  Is this dead? Wounded. Blood, head. It's slowly getting worse. Okay, this this bug is deer.
[2691.82s -> 2718.17s]  Okay, hold on. I'm not food, right? I don't think so. This is a long time to be unconscious.
[2720.63s -> 2737.16s]  It's going to be cold and I need to get to the town. I'm going to try. I got to zoom out.
[2737.16s -> 2752.62s]  So much dust everywhere. There's the bug. I got to have a game plan when I get up.
[2752.62s -> 2768.47s]  This feels... I think you would be dead by now, wouldn't you? If you were unconscious
[2768.47s -> 2786.10s]  out here for this long. What's a bug fighting? Some more raiders. I need to take... I need to see
[2786.10s -> 2792.82s]  the map. I'm so close to this town. I can put a waypoint here. I'm just going to bang right
[2792.82s -> 2800.33s]  a little bit in straight. It's down there. Oh, it's right there. Okay, I just got to get to
[2800.33s -> 2815.72s]  the town. Only like five sped up minutes before I can get over there. Can this sandstorm let
[2815.72s -> 2842.33s]  up so I can see? Almost there. Okay, hold on. Take a look around. I don't see anything. I'm
[2842.33s -> 2856.70s]  just gonna make a beeline for the town. 200 seconds. I gotta get food. I gotta get to work.
[2857.26s -> 2876.10s]  I gotta get armor. I need money. All right, here we go. There's a band over here. All right,
[2876.10s -> 2878.58s]  I'm actually kind of nervous because this is the first time I've had control in like 10
[2878.58s -> 2887.50s]  minutes. Almost 20 minutes without control. It's dark too. I gotta wait. Okay, almost not...
[2887.50s -> 2898.42s]  Almost conscious. It's morning. I'm okay. Here we go. Three, two, one, wake up.
[2901.83s -> 2906.15s]  Playing dead. If enemies are still nearby, a character might play dead in order to avoid
[2906.15s -> 2910.71s]  further fighting. To get right... to get up right click to move, just to make sure there
[2910.71s -> 2920.17s]  are no enemies around. Okay, all right, get these off. Unlock shackles. I only have a 23%
[2920.17s -> 2934.52s]  chance to get this off. Oh man. Is the chance going down or up? It's going up. Does this
[2934.52s -> 2945.70s]  use brain power? I don't think so. Oh, fuck. Here comes the bug. 24% chance. Come on. That's
[2945.70s -> 2957.61s]  one out of four. One out of five. I did it five times already. I'm getting skill up
[2957.61s -> 2968.81s]  and lockpicking though. What am I picking it with? Um, the sand. I'm filling the lock with
[2968.81s -> 2982.33s]  sand and trying to smash it open. So I'm branded as an escaped slave. I'm gonna starve
[2982.33s -> 2997.67s]  to death out here trying to get this off, aren't I? Oh, come on. Seriously? No, get up.
[2998.31s -> 3036.10s]  Fight him. I'm all right. I got it. Get me out of here. Come on. No, no, go this way. I can't
[3036.10s -> 3045.27s]  run. I'm so fucked up. I need to get to this town. My legs... my left leg is destroyed.
[3045.27s -> 3056.39s]  My chest is destroyed. I'm going so slow. I still have the shackles on. I... no, I don't,
[3056.39s -> 3072.07s]  do I? I don't have any first aid. Get there. Come on, shimmy grandpa. Let's go. I'm so close.
[3072.07s -> 3088.15s]  I gotta go to the front gates. Inventory. Boots. Prisoner shackles. Are these armor? Heavy
[3088.15s -> 3091.51s]  prisoner shackles. They stop you from running and doing a lot of things. They will trip you up
[3091.51s -> 3096.07s]  in combat. They are locked on. You need to pick the lock somehow. This item isn't locked,
[3096.07s -> 3106.02s]  but it can stop a sword. I'm good. All right. Run. That didn't mean... it doesn't matter.
[3106.97s -> 3115.13s]  I can't run. Do you see all my problems here? Do you see all my sim problems? My chest, right arm,
[3115.13s -> 3121.59s]  left leg, and hunger meter. I'll have to go to the bathroom really bad. My chest is going to
[3121.59s -> 3137.19s]  piss its pants in about 15 seconds. I'll get there. I don't see anybody, although I'm going
[3137.19s -> 3143.85s]  out... kind of going the back door here. Wait, hold on. I see people here. What do I do?
[3143.85s -> 3149.48s]  Towns. You've discovered your first town. Towns are perfect for stopping up on supplies and selling
[3149.48s -> 3155.24s]  loot. To cash in your loot, you'll need to find a store. Hold alt to show nearby shop signs.
[3157.37s -> 3164.87s]  Okay. I don't have anything. Be wary of entering private buildings. Residents often
[3164.87s -> 3168.87s]  don't like trespassers. You can find out whether a building is marked public or private
[3168.87s -> 3174.78s]  by selecting the building. Also, most shops are closed at night. Let's get these out of the
[3174.78s -> 3179.02s]  way here. Too much damage can result in a KO, crippling, and death. The green bars and the
[3179.02s -> 3183.66s]  health panels show your health. The red bars show bleeding damage. Bleeding damage will need
[3183.66s -> 3189.43s]  first aid. In order to heal, you need to get a first aid kit. You can buy or steal them from
[3189.43s -> 3196.17s]  stores in town. You are injured too. To heal a character, you need first aid kit in your inventory.
[3196.17s -> 3201.05s]  Hold and right click the target, then select first aid. From the menu or simply right click
[3201.05s -> 3207.11s]  the heal icon over the injured person. Yeah. Here it is. First aid. I don't have a med kit. Yeah.
[3208.49s -> 3213.13s]  I'd like to know the next step, but maybe it just assumes that I'm on the next step
[3214.01s -> 3222.23s]  because I can't- I don't have any of these things. I wish- I want to see like the other-
[3223.11s -> 3227.75s]  if I hit skip, it's gonna skip the whole thing, isn't it? Do I have to be unpaused
[3227.75s -> 3243.24s]  while reading it? Okay. I don't think so. All right. Just making sure that I wasn't
[3243.24s -> 3247.00s]  gonna skip at all. Alternatively, you can click the medic button from the right side
[3247.00s -> 3253.96s]  command menu. This will heal all wounded squad members within range. So this one. So I'm gonna-
[3253.96s -> 3261.27s]  I'm gonna get a band of merry men. Just you wait. The yellow areas of the health bar show
[3261.27s -> 3269.51s]  bandaged health. Over time, this will slowly heal back to a healthy green. Okay. All body
[3269.51s -> 3272.87s]  parts are each affected in their own way. Your head, chest, and stomach are your vitals.
[3273.51s -> 3278.47s]  So these are vitals. Head, chest, and stomach are vitals. If any of them fall below zero,
[3278.47s -> 3287.38s]  you will pass out. And if they reach minus 100, you will die. Well, all right. That's good to
[3287.38s -> 3293.74s]  know. If any of the limbs fall below zero, you won't be able to fight or walk properly. You
[3293.74s -> 3299.42s]  can use a splint kit on broken limbs to speed up recovery and improve the limb's function if
[3299.42s -> 3305.43s]  recovered. Okay. The blood stat shows how rapidly you are losing blood. Blood is slowly
[3305.43s -> 3310.65s]  recovered over time, but if it drops below zero, you will pass out. After using a first
[3310.73s -> 3313.69s]  aid kit to bandage your wounds, sleeping in a bed will help you fully recover.
[3314.41s -> 3318.73s]  You need to build your own beds and camp beds or stay at a bar in town for free.
[3320.95s -> 3329.03s]  Let's get in there. Where's the front door? There are people everywhere over here.
[3329.91s -> 3342.20s]  Come on. I'm a dying man. Are these storm wind guards? These have to be storm wind
[3342.20s -> 3346.20s]  guards, right? As they walk up to a storm wind guard and ask where the fucking train is.
[3346.20s -> 3365.35s]  Where's the tram? I keep forgetting where it is. Dust storm. Okay. Just get me in here.
[3366.39s -> 3386.57s]  Why is that? Why are you carrying somebody? Uh, I need help. Citizen. Is this a citizen?
[3387.21s -> 3397.67s]  How do I interact? Uh, bodyguard. Follow. That's okay. It's samurai. Can I talk?
[3402.23s -> 3407.74s]  Why is nobody helping me? This is an elaborate town. All right. Get in there.
[3416.94s -> 3423.61s]  I'm just like shimmying around. I need food. I need shelter. I need anything. Somebody please
[3423.61s -> 3437.56s]  save me. Well, what's wrong here? What was that? Attack a guard to get healed. Oh,
[3437.56s -> 3444.14s]  don't give me that. These guys are freaking me out. Why are you all running like this?
[3444.78s -> 3450.90s]  You're just going to bump into me? A dying guy that's covered in blood,
[3450.90s -> 3458.36s]  desperately looking for help. Nobody has done anything for me. Is this just supposed
[3458.36s -> 3473.45s]  to be normal? Please help me. This is the commander. Gate sergeant. Is there like an emote?
[3474.78s -> 3491.24s]  How do I? Can I just go in? Is this loud in the city? Um, no, no, no. I don't want that.
[3491.24s -> 3508.97s]  Jobs. Taunt. Sneak. Wave. How do I like say hello? Oh, okay. I can just go in. All right.
[3508.97s -> 3530.30s]  First aid. I don't have any money. Go to the bar. Quick. Help me please. I can't go on.
[3530.30s -> 3548.25s]  What? Oh, wait. No, no. Get off me. I have. Why am I unconscious? I don't get it. What happened
[3548.25s -> 3557.08s]  to me? At least he's going to heal me. At least I'm getting free heals. I passed out at the
[3557.08s -> 3562.89s]  steps of the town. This guy, the only guy in town recognizes me as a slave and decides,
[3562.89s -> 3566.01s]  all right, yeah, I'm going to go pick him up. He fell. He fell asleep on the walkway.
[3566.57s -> 3580.81s]  That's great. It is free heals though. Look, double heals. It's because this is a slave or
[3580.89s -> 3609.48s]  town. Oh, well, will they at least feed me in here? What the? Do they give slaves weapons?
[3609.48s -> 3613.08s]  That's a, it's like, okay, here's your, what you do and here's what you're going to do and
[3613.08s -> 3630.98s]  here's your, here's your knife. Is he taking me to the bar? Where am I going? Oh man,
[3630.98s -> 3634.66s]  when we just found our first few characters that are going to, we're going to join together.
[3641.03s -> 3653.51s]  Uh, I kind of turned into a t-shirt somehow. How to escape a prison. You've committed a
[3653.51s -> 3658.79s]  crime and been in prison. What crime? You need to wait out your sentence, have another squad member
[3658.79s -> 3663.27s]  bail you out, or you can try to escape. To escape a prison cell, you need to use your lock
[3663.27s -> 3667.19s]  picking skills. Select your imprisoned character and hold right click on the cage to bring up
[3667.19s -> 3676.36s]  the interaction menu. Select lock pick. The character must be conscious. Now you need to wait
[3676.36s -> 3680.52s]  for success. The speed it takes to lock, to pick a lock is dependent on each individual's
[3680.52s -> 3685.24s]  thievery skill. Once successful, hold right click again on the cage and select escape. You
[3685.24s -> 3692.98s]  may want to wait until any nearby captors are distracted. Am I, I'm in a recovery coma.
[3693.54s -> 3713.08s]  I'm technically kind of out of the cage. How long am I in a recovery coma? I gotta break out
[3713.08s -> 3717.40s]  and I'm gonna break out all these people and I'm gonna put them in my squad and we're gonna
[3717.40s -> 3731.37s]  escape. I'm getting up. Okay, am I awake? Use tools, use strength. I'm not strong enough to do that.
[3734.17s -> 3742.57s]  Unlock shackles and the pick lock is at one percent. I'm never getting out of this cage.
[3756.89s -> 3769.85s]  Just do it a hundred times. Yeah, I got it. Okay, get them off. All right, let's get this open.
[3771.11s -> 3790.02s]  I'm not skilled enough. I can't even do it. Escape. Now I'm stuck here. It's only been one
[3790.02s -> 3812.90s]  day. Okay, I'm not obedient anymore. I have to reset. Game over. Use strength and lift up
[3812.90s -> 3822.23s]  the cage. Well, I can't do that. So what, what happened? How long do you sit in here for?
[3826.84s -> 3838.54s]  Somebody will buy me? Do I get like a percentage of that money? Normal. Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
[3838.54s -> 3852.50s]  Whoa, whoa. All right, I'm not skilled enough. You're a slave. Don't forget it. I mean,
[3853.06s -> 3860.84s]  yes, I'm aware of that. Oh, it's good. I took the shackles off. You put the shackles
[3860.84s -> 3878.36s]  back on. Well, at least I got pants. So why would somebody want to buy me? How many
[3878.36s -> 3892.38s]  days do I have to sit in here? Take them off. Is he going to be mad about that? Am I like an
[3892.38s -> 3908.41s]  unruly baby? This is my life now. I guess I was standing there for a very long time.
[3908.41s -> 3921.30s]  How do I get out of here? How do I like act? When does somebody come get me?
[3921.30s -> 3925.80s]  Practice lockpicking. I'm just going to keep taking my shackles up and putting them back
[3925.80s -> 3954.50s]  on. This is a good practice. Thanks for the training dummy. All right, I got them off. All
[3954.50s -> 3962.30s]  right. Now pick lock still at 1%. Use strength. Escape. He's going to notice. He's
[3962.30s -> 3972.78s]  going to come over and put them back on. Yeah, here we go. Here we go. Put it back on. Give
[3972.78s -> 3987.29s]  me more training. Thank you. No, no, no. My training went, my sensei went downstairs.
[3988.54s -> 3999.88s]  I need him. It's all, it's nighttime. People are going to bed. How do I see my actual stats?
[4002.28s -> 4015.29s]  Status, window, combat, thievery. Lockpicking is at 9. Not bad. Why is everybody else just
[4015.29s -> 4019.93s]  standing there? Because I think they've accepted their fate. Not me though. I'm
[4019.93s -> 4022.97s]  going to practice every damn day to get to a point where I can open this door
[4024.09s -> 4026.81s]  and then I'm going to sprint punch that guy in his mouth as hard as I can.
[4030.14s -> 4038.73s]  Got it. What level is my lockpicking now? Lockpicking 11. The ability to pick locks,
[4038.73s -> 4041.61s]  open doors and safes. More importantly, however, it's also used to break out of
[4041.61s -> 4045.93s]  situations. Cages, jails, handcuffs. It's for those who have value freedom and don't want,
[4045.93s -> 4052.42s]  don't want to wait around to be rescued. Okay. Thievery is also here.
[4053.06s -> 4063.53s]  And I'm just going to wait to get the shackles put on again. Just put them back on myself?
[4068.71s -> 4074.23s]  How can I lock them? This is just doing the Rubik's cube. I can't like lock them again.
[4081.48s -> 4084.76s]  No, I can't. I have to wait for the guy to come out. Practice on the door. I can't.
[4085.48s -> 4095.94s]  I don't have enough skill to attempt the door. Save the shackles to sell them.
[4095.94s -> 4106.97s]  Really? How much are they worth? They're worth nothing. They have no sell value. Okay.
[4109.10s -> 4120.34s]  You can sell the shackles for iron. Eat the shackles. Speaking of food, when do they feed you?
[4122.62s -> 4128.33s]  Because it's been two days and I haven't gotten any food. And then unlock the other...
[4129.21s -> 4135.64s]  All right, here's what's going to happen. I'm going to unlock this door and then I'm going
[4135.64s -> 4139.64s]  to get put in this one. I'm going to unlock this one. I'm going to keep unlocking the doors
[4139.64s -> 4148.07s]  until I have 100 in lockpicking. All right, here we go. Here they come. They're going to
[4148.07s -> 4161.45s]  notice again. Maybe they'll have food this time. He's been playing for an hour and hasn't
[4161.45s -> 4177.69s]  done anything. No, I mean, hey, welcome to... Welcome to Kenshi! I hear anointed... I did
[4177.69s -> 4181.69s]  pick one of the hardest things in the game though. So, you know, I can... I should go
[4181.69s -> 4194.52s]  back properly eventually here and do one of the other scenarios. I'm going to... I'm going
[4194.52s -> 4202.78s]  to die. I'm going to starve to death in this cage. Uh-oh, he's learning. Shut it down.
[4203.58s -> 4212.15s]  No, I'm interested. I'm not giving up on this character yet. I still have faith that I might
[4212.15s -> 4223.56s]  be able to pull something off here. Do they feed us? When... How do we do anything?
[4223.56s -> 4234.39s]  There's a barrel. Can I do anything with the... Oh! Papa just got a new pair of pants.
[4235.11s -> 4253.90s]  How did I get caught stealing? Oh, what is... You rats. What do you mean got caught...
[4253.90s -> 4271.08s]  Where are they? I... Who took them? I didn't even get them. All right, stealing chance. 46%.
[4271.08s -> 4284.81s]  Get them. Got them. Oh, get fucked. Get fucked over, game. You've just stolen from
[4284.89s -> 4293.93s]  someone. Be careful when selling stolen goods to traders. You might just find yourself in
[4293.93s -> 4302.15s]  trouble with the law if they catch you. Oh, get fucking destroyed. You didn't think I had
[4302.15s -> 4312.07s]  as long arms. How to steal. Be careful. Yeah, well, that doesn't mean anything. I still have
[4312.07s -> 4318.22s]  to get out of here. Be careful when selling stolen goods to traders. You might just find
[4318.22s -> 4322.54s]  yourself in trouble with the law if they catch you offloading their allies' belongings. When
[4322.54s -> 4325.90s]  you talk to a trader, initiate the trade screen, hover over a stolen item, check the
[4325.90s -> 4332.06s]  chances of fencing success before selling. If the fencing chance is low and it was stolen from
[4332.06s -> 4337.18s]  someone in the same faction, you'll likely be caught. Your best chance of selling stolen
[4337.18s -> 4341.02s]  goods is to sell to a trader from another town and faction or find a thief in one of the
[4341.02s -> 4345.74s]  town bars. Thieves will buy any item off you risk free. However, their prices
[4345.74s -> 4350.73s]  are much less profitable than the official merchant. Careful trying to open locked
[4350.73s -> 4355.21s]  items and doors is illegal and could land you in trouble. Well, if you get caught,
[4355.69s -> 4361.37s]  as a rule, if the cursor shows red, then that action is hostile. Right. Like every other game.
[4362.68s -> 4366.68s]  Entering sneak mode will help reduce the chance of you getting caught while committing crimes.
[4366.68s -> 4371.56s]  You can find the sneak button at the bottom of the right of the UI. So like down here.
[4373.51s -> 4380.92s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy. OI! Wait, do I get out? Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Something's
[4380.92s -> 4412.42s]  happening here. Okay, cool. Hold on, I gotta put my new pants on. Where are we going? I
[4412.42s -> 4422.25s]  thought I don't have shackles on anymore. No, I do. Make a break for it. But to where though? I
[4422.25s -> 4428.66s]  don't have anything. I don't have any money. I just got a new pair of pants. I lost the group.
[4428.66s -> 4433.64s]  I lost the group on the field trip. I don't remember where I'm supposed to go. Where did
[4433.64s -> 4449.43s]  they go? I lost the group. Is this them? I lost the group on the fucking field trip. I swear
[4449.43s -> 4459.86s]  to God. I don't know where anybody went. I'm going out the front door. I got a pair of
[4459.86s -> 4475.93s]  pants I can sell for one cent. I'm gonna go to the next town. Get me out of here. No, don't touch me.
[4475.93s -> 4487.61s]  What if I just hide over here? Where's the sneak button? Sneak. Is this sneak? I don't know what
[4487.61s -> 4514.65s]  that means. What's wrong? What? What? No, get me out of here. Go down. Go down. Quick, I need
[4514.65s -> 4540.42s]  a bug. Oh, come on. I can't, I can't sprint with these on. I should have kept sneaking.
[4540.42s -> 4557.46s]  Where are we going? He's taking me up the slide. This is cool. What's going on up here? Who's this
[4557.46s -> 4575.19s]  guy? Wait, why are they all freaking out over here? What are you all doing? Oh, I have the,
[4575.19s -> 4597.24s]  I can do it now. I leveled up enough where I can do it. Did I get it? Okay, I got it set free.
[4597.24s -> 4602.78s]  Not yet. Unlock shackles. I'm gonna wait till it's nighttime and I'm fucking out of here.
[4602.78s -> 4607.05s]  I need to, I gotta steal food from somebody's house or something, don't I? All right, wait till
[4607.05s -> 4620.76s]  night. I can open the door. I'm gonna free the other, the other slaves too. All right, time for
[4620.76s -> 4630.57s]  night. Just wait till nighttime. We've got a little bit, we gotta wait and I'm gonna, I'm
[4630.57s -> 4648.10s]  gonna build a shack in here. This is my new home. Okay, let's go. Uncheck obedience slave. Not yet.
[4648.10s -> 4669.46s]  Nighttime. When everybody gets put up here, we're talked to. Hey, dude. No, that's his
[4669.46s -> 4684.92s]  naked dude. How do I talk? Outlaw farmer. I'm too far away. I'm breaking this guy out
[4684.92s -> 4692.90s]  and we're making a run for it. I can hear a bunch of noises. Hold on. Steal his food. He
[4692.90s -> 4697.67s]  doesn't have any food. He's in a cage. Move to the cage next to him.
[4699.91s -> 4716.60s]  So you tell, can I, all right, hold on. Nobody up here, right? Okay. All right. Okay, now I can
[4716.60s -> 4724.92s]  talk. What are you looking at? You want to get out of here, don't you? So what are you in
[4724.92s -> 4728.89s]  for? I'm busting out of here. Are you with me or not? You want to get out of here? He
[4728.89s -> 4734.63s]  says, yeah. Let's bust these cages open and run. Then help me get out of here. Let's make
[4734.63s -> 4738.81s]  a break for it. We'll have a better chance if we escape together. All right, let's get these
[4738.81s -> 4750.94s]  cages open. No, no, no, not right now. Wait till night time. My first friend, but I, he's
[4750.94s -> 4760.22s]  going to die because we're both going to die. I mean, I can pick the lock that I just got in.
[4760.78s -> 4771.30s]  Nothing in there. God damn it. Are they going to remember that I was in this cage over here?
[4771.30s -> 4781.24s]  I'm starving. I know. Oh, my first squad member. Hey, get me out. Okay. I think I just
[4781.24s -> 4791.29s]  have to open it. Pick his lock. Okay. Unlock my cage first. Yeah, I know, I know, I know,
[4791.29s -> 4805.67s]  but I, what if they come up here? Are they going to know that, use him as a distraction?
[4805.67s -> 4815.75s]  Just eat him. I'm not going to eat him. Okay. I'm not opening the door. I'm going to wait till
[4815.75s -> 4829.75s]  night. I don't want to open his door yet. Okay. Here we go. Shhh. Guards back up here.
[4829.75s -> 4836.01s]  The guard's going to see the shackles. Uh oh. Willy though? They're on. Is that enough to,
[4836.01s -> 4840.28s]  let me just get these out of here. By toggling sneaky or entering stealth mode,
[4840.28s -> 4843.24s]  in this mode you can perform stealth knockouts, kidnaps, and steal stuff.
[4843.88s -> 4848.26s]  The stealth cursor displays two icons, an eyeball and a sun. When the eyeball is red,
[4848.26s -> 4852.26s]  it means you are in view of nearby NPCs. When the eyeball is blue, it means that you are
[4852.26s -> 4856.58s]  currently out of anyone's line of sight. The sun icon shows the light level. When the sun
[4856.58s -> 4862.47s]  is shaded, you are at your least visible. Nightfall is prime for sneaking. Right click
[4862.47s -> 4866.47s]  on an NPC while sneaking. The percentage shows the chance of success. The higher your
[4866.47s -> 4869.59s]  assassination skill, the higher the chance of doing a stealth knockout. To kidnap
[4869.67s -> 4876.22s]  a KOed NPC, hold right click on them. It's like kidnap. How to research. To research new tech,
[4876.22s -> 4879.82s]  such as buildings, defensive weapons, blah blah blah. You need a research bench from the build
[4879.82s -> 4887.14s]  menu. Okay. So just a Minecraft bench. Either you can buy a house in a town or you can build
[4887.14s -> 4892.79s]  your own house outside of an NPC town. To craft items, you need to build a workbench
[4892.79s -> 4897.64s]  from the crafting menu. First things first though, you're going to need to research all
[4897.64s -> 4901.48s]  the necessary buildings, equipment, and schematics you need for crafting. Build a research bench
[4901.48s -> 4904.20s]  to learn new techs and crafts. Got it. I just want to get those off the screen.
[4905.00s -> 4914.46s]  All right. It's time of night. Not quite. Almost there. Enslaved the slavers that enslaved
[4914.46s -> 4920.97s]  you. I mean, they have full armor and weapons. We have to break out of here at night
[4921.69s -> 4925.13s]  and sneak out the front door. No, the back door. Are there back doors?
[4935.24s -> 4937.88s]  Don't slow it down. Well, I'm just, I'm scared that somebody's going to, they're
[4937.88s -> 4948.62s]  all going to run up here. You're still on board, right? Quick. Look for a way. Okay.
[4948.94s -> 4955.24s]  Yeah. I got the, it's in motion. The wheels are in motion. Activate sneak to train stealth.
[4958.84s -> 4968.36s]  Is that really? Don't worry. The town will belong to you in a few hours.
[4969.08s -> 4986.81s]  There's a ladder on the right. Ooh, good eyes there. Good eyes. I'm starving.
[4988.63s -> 5000.01s]  I'm going to pass out, aren't I? If this goes down any further. All right. Somebody
[5000.01s -> 5005.96s]  just got the shit beat out of them. They just fell down. There's fresh meat in the
[5006.04s -> 5015.30s]  cage and next to me. Let me scope this place out though. Cause we, I do need food.
[5015.86s -> 5024.66s]  I'm going to have to take the bread from somebody. Hold on. Let me, where is there like an
[5024.66s -> 5038.97s]  inn? Hold alt. Okay. Here we go. So this is prisoner shackles. What? Okay. There we go.
[5038.97s -> 5044.65s]  Right here. I'm going to sneak out. This is that those look like dumplings or something,
[5044.65s -> 5048.25s]  right? Well, like potatoes. I'm going in here and I'm going to take the thing on the front
[5048.25s -> 5069.93s]  desk and we can share it as friends. Ice cream. Here we go. It's time for nightfall.
[5071.03s -> 5075.74s]  Should I open up every cage? That might be a good idea. Or just stick with the plan.
[5077.94s -> 5097.27s]  All right. Open up every cage or stick with the plan. Which one? It's not technically
[5097.27s -> 5105.90s]  really night yet. That's what everybody's asleep. Open, open. No, not yet. The
[5105.90s -> 5112.33s]  people walking around all over the place. Save the game. That's a really, really good idea.
[5113.21s -> 5141.62s]  There's an auto, it's auto saves every 10 minutes, but there. So close.
[5144.58s -> 5148.58s]  Play the pink panther theme. No, that's too distracting. This is, this game's on, see?
[5148.58s -> 5153.30s]  Everyone that wanted me to go, there's a night guard right here that goes to sleep in like two
[5153.30s -> 5168.22s]  hours. I would have walked right into him. Here we go. When he goes to bed, it's time to get
[5168.22s -> 5184.94s]  up. Just go. I can't just go. Don't you understand? It has to be perfect. I don't have
[5184.94s -> 5195.14s]  any items. I'm starving. Here we go. Right, he's down there. I don't know, whatever he's doing at
[5195.14s -> 5207.56s]  night. Rapidly. Whatever he's doing, whatever he's up to down there. All right, is it time? No,
[5207.56s -> 5218.62s]  he's not done. He's not done yet. There's two people doing it too. I don't know where the
[5218.62s -> 5251.19s]  second person came from. Okay, but he's downstairs. I think he's done. Use the
[5251.19s -> 5258.60s]  ladder. He came back. I didn't know if he came back or not. I didn't, I thought, I thought he,
[5258.60s -> 5266.71s]  when does he go to sleep? It's 2 a.m. No, he's going back downstairs to like masturbate again.
[5266.71s -> 5283.67s]  No, he's gone. Let's go. Get it? No, there it is. All right, we got plenty of time. He's
[5283.67s -> 5299.98s]  got 65 tabs open. Let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where am I? Wait, where did I, where's my
[5299.98s -> 5323.69s]  character? Oh, go, go, Jeremy, go. Just go, go. I opened the door and he screamed. Is he
[5323.69s -> 5345.37s]  alive? He didn't even wait for me. They're all down there having a great time. Wait, hey.
[5348.01s -> 5358.06s]  No, why is this guy, he didn't cut his leg off. Oh, what the fuck? I can't get out of here.
[5361.56s -> 5369.14s]  How am I supposed to get out of here? I need to help him. Honest to God. Okay, he,
[5370.52s -> 5389.96s]  I gotta eat this guy. I have to eat him. How do I eat him? Why can they hear, I don't understand.
[5389.96s -> 5413.32s]  Why can they hear us? This, I was sneaking. Is it, every time, I'm unconscious. All right,
[5413.32s -> 5443.74s]  so when the door opens, they just run up here. I'm safe scumming. Okay, so let me,
[5443.74s -> 5453.16s]  let me understand this. So when I, I'm going to open his door. What, really dude, come on.
[5453.96s -> 5480.78s]  Give me a break. Turn off obedience. I'm on sneak, but when I open.
[5484.94s -> 5501.06s]  All right, will you get the fuck out of here? Turn off jobs. I'm on the sprint setting. All
[5501.06s -> 5506.66s]  right, here he goes. Here we go. One, two, three, obedience slave off. Sneak on. Jobs off.
[5506.74s -> 5519.62s]  Open door. Escape. Sneak on. What the hell are you doing? Escape. What? What, did I go back in?
[5519.62s -> 5548.55s]  What? Obedience slave off. Sneak on. Open his lock. Oh my God, he's back. Get out of here.
[5548.55s -> 5557.32s]  Shackles. I know, I know, I know. Wait till he gets out of here. Let the other guy out. Not,
[5557.32s -> 5561.90s]  not with this guy sitting right here. He can't see you. You can escape if you sneak. He's
[5561.90s -> 5567.90s]  not going to do that. This random party member. I'm going to open his door and see what happens.
[5569.54s -> 5572.42s]  Because every time I open his door, he freaks out and just starts sprinting.
[5580.73s -> 5584.65s]  Fuck him. Leave him. Look, see? Look, this is not my fault. This is his fault.
[5586.73s -> 5597.74s]  Can I like tell him to just not do this? Let's go to the squad tab. He's not here.
[5597.98s -> 5646.78s]  This is how to do it. I need my... What? Wait, wait. How? They weren't even here.
[5654.95s -> 5673.98s]  The ladder. I can't even use this ladder. How do I know? Because everybody in chat has been
[5673.98s -> 5683.67s]  saying I can't use it. I've seen at least five people say that ladder's a prop. Watch. I'll
[5683.67s -> 5686.95s]  tell you. Let's see if the ladder's a prop. Let's see if I'm getting baited here. Let's
[5686.95s -> 5705.40s]  see if the ladder's a prop. Take off sprint. Let's check the ladder. Hey, look. The ladder's
[5705.40s -> 5718.30s]  a prop. This is why I didn't try it. Oh, fuck. I'm out. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[5718.30s -> 5735.14s]  wait, wait, wait. How am I supposed to get out of here? I can't sneak out of here. I can't even
[5735.14s -> 5746.74s]  see in the building. He's going to cause a distraction. I have an idea. I'm going to
[5746.74s -> 5751.61s]  open it. I'm going to sneak this way. Once I open it, I got to move this way quick.
[5752.17s -> 5768.09s]  I'm going to pause it. Floor button. Floor button. Okay. Ooh, fuck. Okay, hold on.
[5768.09s -> 5781.37s]  I can sneak by that. This guy causes a problem every time though. Watch. Good.
[5782.09s -> 5797.83s]  All right. Why is he sneaking now? Do you understand? He didn't do this before.
[5797.83s -> 5812.62s]  Go. Get over there. What are you doing? I didn't stop sneaking. Look. It's right here.
[5816.04s -> 5826.90s]  Fuck this guy. I'm leaving him. I'm taking him. I have to uncheck this box. What? This
[5826.90s -> 5843.51s]  guy causes a problem every time. I'm taking his stuff. Here. Like, you know what? Deal with it.
[5843.51s -> 5864.58s]  Here. You can have this. I'll just dress you. You can have the shackles too.
[5864.58s -> 5870.38s]  I can't manage him. What? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened?
[5870.38s -> 5877.91s]  What happened? Did he just take the clothes? Why did he take my clothes?
[5880.70s -> 5891.61s]  He realized. Give me his weapon. Where's his weapon? I can't grab his weapon.
[5896.71s -> 5902.57s]  Still the guard's weapon? No, it's this. All right. I got a weapon.
[5906.31s -> 5913.24s]  Legally blind. No, it was like a weird stick. Okay. So, this guy ruins it every time.
[5913.80s -> 5917.72s]  I open the door and he just walks out. He doesn't wait. He doesn't wait for me. He just goes.
[5917.72s -> 5947.77s]  I can't control him. He just fucking walks away. He took you. I know he took the stick.
[5947.77s -> 5968.49s]  Kind of like hiding the barrel. Is this building on fire? What the fuck?
[5970.23s -> 5978.44s]  Okay. Look. So, we've got guy at the table. Guy over here. What is in there? I wonder.
[5979.08s -> 5999.48s]  Oh shit. Okay. Hold on a minute here. Will these guys see? I mean, what's their line
[5999.48s -> 6010.31s]  of sight like? Oh, I'm good. Just please tell me nobody comes over here. I'm going to loot
[6010.31s -> 6022.90s]  everything over here. Let's go right to the box. You gotta be kidding me. He saw me through
[6022.90s -> 6060.25s]  the fucking bathroom stall crack. He heard me. Wait, let me try this one more time.
[6060.25s -> 6066.86s]  Jump off the building. No, this isn't the game's fault. I'm playing on the hardest
[6066.86s -> 6072.36s]  difficulty in the entire game. I'm playing at rock bottom. So, we have to play rock bottom.
[6072.36s -> 6079.98s]  We have to deal with the rock bottom issue. Why did I do that? Because chat pia pressured
[6079.98s -> 6095.37s]  me into doing something once again. Oh no, that wasn't one guy. That was like two thousand guys.
[6095.37s -> 6104.95s]  All right. Let's try this again. So, is this what is this with the I don't understand what
[6104.95s -> 6111.46s]  this is. What is the is that everyone moves together or is that sneak? Is this there's
[6111.46s -> 6120.28s]  only this sneak is already activated. That's like fast run. So, there is no other option
[6120.36s -> 6136.04s]  besides this. Fucking god. That's not what I wanted to do. Why did he go? Well, I would have
[6136.04s -> 6145.54s]  walked into that guy anyways. It's for your whole squad to run together. That makes sense.
[6149.88s -> 6154.04s]  Use the ladder this time. Why? We already proved that the ladder is just a prop. It doesn't do
[6154.04s -> 6187.98s]  anything. Can I like walk over this? I don't think I can. Six percent chance. Not gonna
[6187.98s -> 6193.34s]  get out at six percent. Why is this one so much harder than the other ones?
[6193.90s -> 6201.51s]  You train your skills as a slave. Learn to fight. Learn to revolt. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[6204.65s -> 6207.29s]  Everybody wants me to eat this guy and then jump over the building.
[6207.93s -> 6238.38s]  We gotta play rock bottom. Right click the ladder. No, there's no context menu there.
[6238.38s -> 6245.67s]  You must believe in the ladder. Everything you do makes you stronger. Losing and die makes you
[6245.67s -> 6248.63s]  tougher. If you keep reloading sage, you get rid of all that experience you've been learning.
[6252.18s -> 6260.97s]  Yeah, this game is about getting your ass kicked. There's another person over here.
[6261.45s -> 6270.95s]  I don't think you can go over here, but that would be pretty effective if you could.
[6272.20s -> 6277.78s]  All right. Shackles. I'm just gonna go naked. Stealth KO this guy.
[6280.65s -> 6312.07s]  Isn't that gonna make noise? Here we go. Watch this shit. Stealth KO that guy with zero
[6312.07s -> 6321.61s]  percent. That's not gonna work. What chance did you have? There's none. I can't hurt
[6321.61s -> 6325.69s]  anybody. I can't fight anybody. I have to just deal with it. I've got to get out,
[6325.77s -> 6332.09s]  have to escape, and I have to find something to eat. And then I'm gonna start over as like
[6332.09s -> 6340.07s]  a man and his dog. Climb on the cage and WWE this guy. No, I'm gonna take off the shackles,
[6341.91s -> 6346.31s]  unlock the cage, and I'm getting out of here. Once this guy goes downstairs.
[6346.87s -> 6360.42s]  I'm trying this one more time. I am on sneak. I am being very silent. No shackles. No,
[6360.42s -> 6376.55s]  I don't have any gear on. No gear. Turk off slave. No jobs. No range. Only sneak.
[6376.55s -> 6389.24s]  This guy's just... is that guy gonna see me? I mean, he's just sitting right there.
[6406.78s -> 6414.78s]  I can't sneak by that. Steal the gear from the back room. I've tried to twice.
[6415.58s -> 6423.69s]  I mean, I could... I can't just run. They're faster than me. Maybe... are they gonna... is
[6423.69s -> 6435.26s]  their AI gonna go in different spots this time? It is. Okay, good. Go. All right. I made it
[6435.26s -> 6457.08s]  around the corner. I'm not moving a muscle. All right. Get me over here. Safe. Oops. All
[6457.08s -> 6471.32s]  right. Here we go. He's gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Quick. What's in the box? There's
[6471.32s -> 6477.86s]  nothing even in here. What a bait. There's nothing here. Why? What about the safe? You
[6477.86s -> 6481.94s]  don't have any money in your safe. Okay. What about this thing? Nothing. It's empty.
[6482.58s -> 6490.49s]  Pick the lock. 77% chance. This is what I get for practicing in the cell the whole time.
[6492.73s -> 6499.08s]  Got it. Oh, cool. There's a flip book in here. There's a notebook in here.
[6499.64s -> 6505.29s]  Wanted. Cannibal leaders. Leader of the entire known cannibal population. Actual magical
[6505.37s -> 6517.77s]  powers unknown. Reward 40,000 C. Sure, I'll... I'll take it. What am I doing? What? What happened?
[6520.01s -> 6531.45s]  Was that an alarm? Was the book... was the book alarmed? Did the book have a tripwire on it?
[6532.09s -> 6542.90s]  No, he dropped a bunch of frames. Yeah, we're good. We're back. It was trapped?
[6543.54s -> 6553.29s]  It was not trapped. I don't understand how it was a book. He's not gonna ever hear it,
[6553.29s -> 6563.91s]  right? Okay, so there's nothing in any of these. There's something in here. They can hear you take
[6563.91s -> 6568.23s]  stuff. All loot is alarmed in this game. Enemies for three miles will hear you. Oh,
[6568.95s -> 6572.50s]  it's because I was reading that out loud. Maybe I shouldn't have read that out loud.
[6572.50s -> 6579.10s]  What about in here? There's no stray weapon or food or clothes in any of this shit.
[6581.85s -> 6592.42s]  More books. They're gonna hear me take these books. Why am I Naruto running? All right,
[6592.42s -> 6613.05s]  I can't pick up anything. I just have to get out of here. I need to get that manga.
[6613.69s -> 6622.36s]  Now let's move this way. So here's the question. There's so many guards everywhere.
[6622.36s -> 6625.88s]  I don't have any shackles on. I just have a pair of pants. I have no food.
[6628.25s -> 6634.87s]  People are saying so much blatantly false shit about this game. So what you're saying is,
[6635.59s -> 6647.30s]  chat's trying to fuck me over on purpose. Blatantly false shit. How do I get out of
[6647.30s -> 6652.86s]  here? I don't even know if I can get out of here. I think I just have to be a slave.
[6656.47s -> 6667.94s]  You know what I'm saying? There's no way I can get out of this. Go out the back door.
[6670.20s -> 6680.58s]  I have to go. No, that's just more blatantly false shit. I have to go this way. I have to
[6680.58s -> 6690.60s]  somehow sneak by all these guys. This person is going to see me leave this door.
[6693.64s -> 6697.08s]  I think I might just have to serve my time. Yeah, I think so.
[6697.96s -> 6706.82s]  And I climb through windows. I don't think so. Look at all the guards everywhere. I can't even
[6706.82s -> 6711.30s]  pick up a book. They'll know I'm picking the book up. Wait, what's this? Turn off this light.
[6712.34s -> 6725.08s]  Auto haul. What? These guys have to get out of the way. Not that guy, the other one.
[6727.51s -> 6734.46s]  Serve your sentence. I can't stealth knock anybody out. That guy has the
[6734.46s -> 6745.75s]  weapon up there. I have to get that guy's weapon or get him out. Why do I have one
[6745.75s -> 6753.05s]  arm? Because I picked the hardest difficulty in the game. Because I think maybe 15 people
[6753.05s -> 6761.48s]  thought it would be funny. I can try to run. I can try, but I don't think that's going to get me
[6761.48s -> 6772.25s]  very far. Where's the quickest way out of here? I got so far to run. Look at how far I have to
[6772.25s -> 6797.16s]  go. If I just click here and do sprint. Oh fuck. Oh my god. I don't even know where I am.
[6797.16s -> 6804.92s]  No. No, there's no getting out of here. No, okay. This is fun. That was fun. We're going
[6804.92s -> 6811.78s]  to do a new game. This is what I've been on this whole time. I've been on rock bottom very hard.
[6811.78s -> 6816.34s]  Zero dollars. You've hit absolute rock bottom. You're alone. I'm naked hungry. You don't have any
[6816.34s -> 6851.98s]  stuff. You lost an arm. No, a man and his dog. And begin. Skeleton? Should I be a hive?
[6851.98s -> 6874.07s]  That won't make him look weird. No, there's only two. We have to have a human. I can't do
[6874.07s -> 6896.98s]  the weird hammerhead shark thing yet. So let's go. That's okay. It's you. Well, that's very funny.
[6903.96s -> 6920.82s]  Arm bulk. Legendary posture. Legendary posture.
[6926.60s -> 6947.67s]  This looks like I'm wearing one of those comedy sumo suits. All right. That's fine.
[6948.39s -> 6965.10s]  We don't need to spend that much time. I'm just making a turtle. That's what it's going to end up
[6965.10s -> 7004.98s]  being. Let's go like right here. Oh man. I like the raised eyebrows. I'm not spending that
[7004.98s -> 7039.06s]  much time on this one. I just want to get into the game again. Oh boy. Oh boy. It's perfect.
[7039.14s -> 7039.78s]  It's perfect.
[7058.42s -> 7066.68s]  It's Sephiroth. If they got crushed by a fucking anvil. All right. I'm happy.
[7068.12s -> 7107.22s]  Name. I need a name. Where's the name? Anvil Roth. Anvil Roth? No. Canned. Canned Roth. There
[7107.22s -> 7130.38s]  you go. I fucking hate it. All right. What about my dog? Do I get to make my dog?
[7130.38s -> 7133.18s]  There are other characters' appearance haven't been changed. I'll show you what. Wait, wait,
[7133.18s -> 7144.31s]  wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. I do get to make the dog. Or do I? I think I can do anything with
[7144.31s -> 7162.23s]  the dog. What's Sephiroth's, what was Sephiroth's weapon called? Didn't he have like a scythe or
[7162.23s -> 7185.37s]  something? The Masamune? I can't change this. All right. I'm ready. I start as a man and his
[7185.37s -> 7204.92s]  dog. Here we go. Finally. I have a weapon. You've just hired your first recruit. You can
[7204.92s -> 7209.24s]  select different squad members by clicking on their icons in the squad panel. By using the number
[7209.24s -> 7212.12s]  keys or by left clicking and dragging them in the game. Yeah. Select your new recruit.
[7213.24s -> 7217.83s]  You can check your character's skill statistic by opening the stats menu from the command menu.
[7218.71s -> 7228.50s]  Okay. Yep. Everyone's got different stats. The dog is an engineer. Oh no, never mind.
[7228.50s -> 7235.18s]  All right. To perform first aid, exchange inventory items, guard, follow, and carry squad
[7235.18s -> 7239.18s]  members. Hold right click on them or on their portrait to bring up their interactions menu.
[7241.19s -> 7246.39s]  Right. Okay. So you can follow. You can follow you. Bodyguard. You can bodyguard. Okay. Bodyguard.
[7246.95s -> 7262.31s]  That's what I want. Staying close to Kandroth and bodyguarding Kandroth. I'm ready. Where
[7262.31s -> 7269.96s]  are we going to go first? There's so much here. Uh, where are the towns? How many jobs or
[7269.96s -> 7281.56s]  anything? Play as the dog. I'm not going to play as the dog. What do I have for a weapon?
[7284.22s -> 7291.90s]  Okay. I do have first aid. I have a iron stick. Let's do some scavenging. I'm happy now. This is
[7291.90s -> 7307.30s]  I'm actually excited. You know how prepared I am for this? What's this? What's wrong? Get in.
[7312.33s -> 7330.34s]  Oh, I just walked away. And from my first trick, I'm going to attach myself to a prisoner
[7330.34s -> 7351.77s]  pole and I'm going to escape. Welcome to the magic show. I love how I'm just like
[7351.85s -> 7362.73s]  three feet off the ground. Oh, something going on over here. Oh, something happening over here.
[7363.80s -> 7378.81s]  Just wait till I get these cuffs off and we'll go investigate. Go watch the fight.
[7378.81s -> 7396.06s]  Where the hell is it? Whoa. There's a there's an absolute battle going on over here. Come on.
[7396.06s -> 7414.98s]  This is the content. I need to see this. Get out of the cuffs. There's a there's a war going
[7414.98s -> 7420.20s]  on over there and I'm I can't go that far. I can only go as far as I can. Did I get out?
[7420.20s -> 7442.07s]  I'm out, right? All right. Escape. Let's go quickly. Big Fred Flintstone running away.
[7442.07s -> 7452.23s]  All right. Look at this shit. Where's my friend? Come on. Hurry up. All right. I got to be ready
[7452.23s -> 7469.35s]  for this. Let's get a good view. There's some major conflict going on down here.
[7469.35s -> 7476.78s]  Holy shit. Look at this. You want to know what the plan is? It's called let them all kill
[7476.78s -> 7487.96s]  each other and then go pick up all the scraps. Where's the dog? Get over here. I just found a
[7487.96s -> 7501.14s]  bunch of free stuff. Okay, here we go. Just be a vulture. No, they don't even care about
[7501.14s -> 7507.40s]  me. What? Why would they even give a shit that I'm here? I'm just gonna go start picking up
[7507.40s -> 7511.74s]  stuff on people's bodies. I have nothing to do with this conflict. It's just free stuff for me.
[7512.62s -> 7515.74s]  Oh, well. Oh, yeah. I'll take a fucking sword. That'd be nice.
[7516.38s -> 7522.44s]  Give me all your armor. Holy shit. It's like a rare. That's a rare.
[7522.44s -> 7539.43s]  I'm getting rare items. Well, thanks for the immense improvement. Can I even wear this?
[7541.59s -> 7551.10s]  Well, what's happening? Hey, I traded you all my shit. You woke up with my stuff.
[7557.53s -> 7570.54s]  Uh-oh. Got you. You got anything else on you? No. Next person. Come on. What's wrong with my head?
[7579.77s -> 7590.55s]  Pants? Yep. Give me these big armor boots. Not the Minecraft shoes. Stealing chance. 100%.
[7590.55s -> 7595.13s]  Was it a standard grade? No, that's good. I'm gonna keep that on. Do you have any money?
[7595.13s -> 7604.15s]  This guy has some other stuff too though. What is that? Holy shit. What's that thing?
[7604.15s -> 7617.88s]  Just take it. I don't know. Evil thief. All right. Hold. This guy's kind of hard.
[7620.17s -> 7636.81s]  Get him. Hit him with your sword. I'm gonna have to start running. Uh, can you not hit him? Get
[7636.81s -> 7645.48s]  him. Bite him. That guy has a huge cloud weapon too. This is gonna be like true Final Fantasy.
[7645.48s -> 7648.76s]  Does he look like a commander or anything? Is he? How you doing? Oh, shit. I gotta hit.
[7649.32s -> 7665.93s]  Give the sword to the dog. That's not how this works. Swing your sword at him. No, wait.
[7668.14s -> 7693.10s]  Why is this guy so much better than me? Can I see his health? He's almost dead. Oh my. He's
[7693.10s -> 7714.97s]  a soldier and you are a random idiot. Well, how did I take out the other soldier? Don't worry. I
[7714.97s -> 7719.77s]  might have been too heavy. All right. Well, let's just, let's get easy stuff. I'm taking
[7719.77s -> 7741.27s]  the one person and we're getting out of here. All right. Come on. Is this too big? No. Let's
[7741.27s -> 7750.34s]  go. Let's get out of here. Out. Out, out, out, out, out, out. Get out. Okay. Wait. This
[7750.34s -> 7754.98s]  is one. There's another sword over here. Get it. And then get out. That's a cool sword.
[7754.98s -> 7758.10s]  Take it. I don't know if this is, but take it too. I don't want those pants. Just go.
[7758.90s -> 7770.63s]  Am I too heavy? All right. We're far enough away from the battle. Let me see what else this guy
[7770.63s -> 7778.47s]  has. I can actually take a look. Attack bonus plus six plus six damage versus animals. It's
[7778.47s -> 7786.18s]  the same weapon. Armor penetration. I need to like, I need to, I need to go safe and look
[7786.18s -> 7799.30s]  at this stuff. All right. Dog is fine. Dog just has backpack. Does not have anything else.
[7800.98s -> 7814.71s]  All right. I'm good. Let us continue. Let's go this way. Oh no, that's the dog. Sorry.
[7815.93s -> 7823.35s]  You are on bodyguard and staying close. Good. We're both hungry. At least he is. You can
[7823.35s -> 7827.51s]  have conscious characters carry KO'd characters to safety. That's good to know.
[7828.94s -> 7833.42s]  Carry them to a bed. The rescue job will find nearby unconscious allies and automatically
[7833.42s -> 7837.98s]  carry them to bed if there are any in the vicinity. Interesting. And disguises. If you
[7837.98s -> 7841.34s]  have the complete outfit, you can use faction uniforms to disguise yourself.
[7842.06s -> 7847.03s]  Disguise success is dependent on the stealth skill stat. Your character status
[7847.03s -> 7854.94s]  will show as disguised when you are hidden in full uniform. Okay. Carefully you don't get
[7854.94s -> 7857.90s]  caught wearing a faction's uniform. Most people don't take too kindly to impostors.
[7858.86s -> 7867.38s]  You got it. So it's time to just explore. I'm thinking we go up to the north here.
[7867.38s -> 7878.28s]  Into the cold. That sounds like a good time to me. I need to make a house. I got a lot
[7878.28s -> 7893.42s]  of stuff to do. How many money? I got 13 cents. It says disguise blown. Somebody
[7893.42s -> 7896.54s]  he's seen through you. Disguise cooldown 60 seconds. We're going to be far enough away
[7896.54s -> 7904.78s]  from those people, but it's not going to matter. Whoa. What happened over here?
[7905.58s -> 7930.33s]  Something crawled as a person. Are you alive? Saber cutting damage 39.
[7931.05s -> 7937.61s]  52. Blunt 0.02. Blunt. This is better. Blood loss is just better. Attack bonus minus 5
[7938.49s -> 7941.85s]  plus 6. Indoors penalty. There's an indoors penalty on this one. Wait.
[7942.73s -> 7947.45s]  This is much lighter. Oh fuck this thing. What about this?
[7949.50s -> 7965.72s]  Metal plate. Blunt resistance 7. 17. It's actually better. Shirt. What's this? Cut
[7965.72s -> 7975.18s]  resistance efficiency. This is armor. Yeah. It is lighter though by a lot. No it's not. Yeah
[7975.18s -> 7987.38s]  it is. What happened to my boots? Did I just throw the boots in the ground? Where did my boots go?
[7987.94s -> 7997.06s]  What happened to my shoes? Did I- Where did the shoes go? I didn't- Oh right. Because
[7997.06s -> 8001.54s]  it- Okay. I forgot. I didn't save it till then. Let's check this other guy.
[8002.42s -> 8016.36s]  Blood loss 6.5. 13. It's actually better. Attack bonus minus 4 though. I'm not sure
[8016.36s -> 8027.48s]  that's better from what I have right now. More defense. Carrying too much stuff. Well,
[8027.48s -> 8029.80s]  I'm going to get- I'm not going to use this so you can have it in your
[8030.76s -> 8039.03s]  total weight. 38 out of 15. Oh shit. Okay. No, I am too heavy. Let's see what happens if I take
[8039.03s -> 8049.77s]  that off. 18 out of 15. 13 out of 15. That's all right. I got- That's all right. Use the
[8049.77s -> 8073.02s]  cloud sword. Armor penetration damage versus robots. 19 out of 15. Wait. What did I just-
[8073.74s -> 8089.80s]  God damn it. I mean I can't pick that up. Why can't I pick that up? That's fine.
[8090.70s -> 8093.02s]  Uh, I can sell this stuff though. How much does it sell for?
[8094.28s -> 8104.36s]  1700. I don't even care how much I weigh. I will slug my way to a ton. Weapon 2. No,
[8104.36s -> 8108.09s]  it doesn't fit in that slot. All right. Well, I'm going to be- I'm very heavy, but
[8108.73s -> 8115.83s]  where- having this- just wearing it? Is it train strength? So I need just to weigh down
[8115.83s -> 8119.19s]  on myself. Does it matter if it's in my inventory or do I have to put it on?
[8119.99s -> 8135.10s]  Click on the name of the item. So you hold alt. Can't pick that up. Well, I'll just keep
[8135.10s -> 8142.55s]  that here for fun. So I can't really move that well, but let's go up here. So I'm going
[8142.55s -> 8146.63s]  to bang them right- actually I can just go like this, right? Yeah. So I'm going to move
[8146.63s -> 8151.91s]  very slowly, but I don't want to walk across the battlefield. I'm not going to, right?
[8151.91s -> 8172.42s]  I mean I kind of am. Yeah. I'm untouchable right now. Don't worry. They're all fighting
[8172.42s -> 8179.21s]  over there. I just need to slowly- where's my strength? Let's see stats. Strength. 28.
[8180.09s -> 8189.29s]  28%. 29%. That's so- you actually have to strength train. I'm probably going to get
[8189.29s -> 8203.83s]  hungry doing this, aren't I? What's that on the ground? Popcorn? Got to hit the gym.
[8204.71s -> 8212.34s]  I do have to keep an eye out for a town. Ooh. No, that's a camp. But what is that,
[8212.34s -> 8231.40s]  though? I mean, should I investigate this? Probably not. There's nothing here. No bandits,
[8231.48s -> 8242.55s]  no slavers anywhere. That's good. I'm okay for now. I'm just going to slowly make my way.
[8246.81s -> 8266.57s]  Strength. This is the lamest thing. Click the building. Public. Hamlet condition. Small shack.
[8266.57s -> 8277.10s]  Doesn't say anything. Speed up the game speed. Yeah. I'm just like kind of walking slowly.
[8285.64s -> 8297.67s]  Okay. How close are we now? Not close at all. Can you build a car in this game? That's
[8297.67s -> 8303.43s]  interesting looking. Let's keep going. Discovered- wait, what did I discover?
[8311.08s -> 8333.34s]  Ravaged Hamlet. This is the zone? What's my strength doing? What is that? Ravaged Hamlet,
[8333.34s -> 8342.41s]  guard outpost, bast. There are four people that live here. 14 live in the city. This is
[8342.41s -> 8359.75s]  just nothing out here over here. Then what is that? Hold on. I have to discover. Well,
[8359.75s -> 8364.98s]  let's just keep going. Oh, it's dark. I need to set up a camp or something. Like a campfire?
[8364.98s -> 8371.70s]  I hear something. I hear something. I hear something. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop,
[8371.70s -> 8381.75s]  stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I heard like clanging. Was it me? It might have just been me.
[8381.75s -> 8398.47s]  What's that? Is that a new squad member potentially? What is it? It's a bone dog.
[8399.78s -> 8410.22s]  Oh no. I'm gonna say this game is huge. Food. It's food. It's food. I can eat that dog.
[8412.81s -> 8424.87s]  I'm okay though. We're not hungry. I can make it. I played for three days before I
[8424.87s -> 8432.46s]  saw a camp. Holy shit. Discovered Watchtower. Let's take a look at what it is.
[8433.80s -> 8451.85s]  Watchtower. What do you think? Should we check it out? Let's go to the Watchtower. All right.
[8462.10s -> 8479.34s]  This does, this feels so stupid. Okay, slow it down. I want to see where we are. There's the
[8479.34s -> 8490.63s]  Watchtower. The question is, what is in the Watchtower? I see a band of, I'm not sure what.
[8490.63s -> 8507.75s]  Are these raiders or hungry bandits? I don't want to cross their path for sure. Whoa! Go
[8507.75s -> 8510.95s]  this way. Go this way. Go this way. Go that way. Go that way. There's so many people right
[8510.95s -> 8523.62s]  here. These are paladins. Oh wait, no, no. This is fine. Paladins are not going to attack on
[8523.62s -> 8545.40s]  sight, right? Why would they? Yeah, I'm just going to avoid them. I want to go into the
[8545.40s -> 8555.00s]  tower over there. That's not where they're going, right? Holy Chosen. Holy Sentinel. Quiet.
[8555.56s -> 8586.06s]  Let's go. I'll get up there. He's five times wider than he is tall. They're going a really
[8586.06s -> 8599.29s]  weird route. I think I'm okay to run. What's my strength at now? Three. I'm doing a great
[8599.29s -> 8613.96s]  job just walking around with incredibly heavy armor. All right, we're good. Both sides. Let's
[8613.96s -> 8649.48s]  get up there. What's in here? Arm of Okren. It's finally going to be light out. Why is
[8649.48s -> 8654.46s]  everybody freaking out? Don't, don't, don't. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Don't
[8654.46s -> 8667.42s]  go in there. Don't. Why? I can, I can have a conversation with these guys. Save it. I'll
[8667.42s -> 8681.70s]  save it. Fine. Okay. Conversation. Let's talk about what we can do for each other. I've got
[8681.70s -> 8695.27s]  some supplies. If you guys have anything I can trade. There is no, like I had a chat bubble.
[8695.27s -> 8711.11s]  Out of bounds. Get out. Who had the speech bubble? I can sleep in their beds. All right.
[8711.11s -> 8728.22s]  That's fine. Leave. Oh, all right. All right. All right. Relax. I'm leaving. There's the
[8728.22s -> 8730.86s]  guy with the speech bubble. Why aren't you leaving your trespassing? Get out. Wait, wait,
[8730.86s -> 8738.10s]  wait, wait, wait. Talk to Paladin. Blessings from the Lord of Light, brother. Okren's light
[8738.10s -> 8742.78s]  shines brightly today. A good omen. Any travel advice? Any tips on how to live more
[8742.86s -> 8750.07s]  wholesomely for an Okrenite newbie? Greetings. Are you free to discuss the word of Narco?
[8750.07s -> 8757.85s]  Sorry, I have to go. Any tips on how to live more wholesomely for a newbie? Study the scriptures
[8757.85s -> 8763.05s]  of light, meditate on them, pray to Okren, and respect his holy servants with an open heart.
[8764.14s -> 8770.98s]  Brother, this is the way to a pious existence. For darkness preys on an undisciplined mind.
[8770.98s -> 8773.94s]  As for duty, if you are blessed with the skills for it, you may carry out
[8773.94s -> 8782.81s]  Okren's retribution directly by bringing marked heretics to the Inquisitorium. Any travel advice?
[8782.81s -> 8787.13s]  Venturing on a pilgrimage, brother? Well, it's best to stick to holy territory. The
[8787.13s -> 8791.69s]  Outerlands are infested with Narco's heretics that will try to deceive and tempt you into
[8791.69s -> 8797.37s]  the darkness with them. But if you must venture further, above all else, you must avoid
[8797.37s -> 8803.67s]  traveling northwest. Only the most devilish monstrosities prowl there a hundred times
[8803.67s -> 8807.75s]  the size of a man with the hunger of a rabid demon. Isn't that where I was planning on
[8808.07s -> 8813.98s]  going? The foolish treasure hunters are the only travelers to delve there and never to return,
[8813.98s -> 8819.08s]  but how tragic it is. There's nothing worth searching for. There's no place for riches
[8819.08s -> 8831.14s]  if Okren is already in your heart. Thanks for the info. Alright. Hey, thanks. That was
[8831.14s -> 8842.09s]  actually some pretty good info. You have any food? What did I do? I saved the game!
[8842.09s -> 8856.46s]  They didn't like that I saved the game! What?! What are you doing?! Hey! I don't understand!
[8856.54s -> 8867.27s]  Where are we going? Why is this happening? They told you to leave so- I just had a conversation
[8867.27s -> 8876.94s]  with one of them! I was literally just talking to the guy for like 10 straight minutes
[8876.94s -> 8885.62s]  about Okren and thanks for the tips and advice. Time for me to leave. Goodbye. See you later.
[8885.62s -> 8937.45s]  Where's the dog? Uh, time- dog only. I don't understand. I- I don't get it. I was just
[8937.45s -> 8957.74s]  having a conversation with the dude. First aid. Yes, use it. Just run. Run and don't look
[8957.74s -> 8985.72s]  back! Get out of the cage quick! Get- pick the lock! Get out of the cage now! Alright,
[8985.72s -> 8991.64s]  I can- dying. I gotta go quick. Quick quick quick. Get out. Get out. Out out out. Okay,
[8991.64s -> 9006.54s]  set free. Escape. What am I- what am I- what's wrong with you? Why am I crawling? Get up!
[9006.54s -> 9017.99s]  What's wrong with my leg? Come on! What? You're there. You're not welcome here. Don't
[9017.99s -> 9035.35s]  make me ask you twice. I can't even stand up. I was gonna fucking leave! I wasn't- I was
[9035.35s -> 9046.58s]  talking to the guy out in front- in the front door. Like, I was standing right here having
[9046.58s -> 9074.55s]  a conversation on the steps of their house. Alright, let's go. See, out of bounds. Get
[9074.55s -> 9085.64s]  out. Like, but I- I- I'm gone. I'm gone. Bye. See you later. Thanks for nothing.
[9085.64s -> 9089.64s]  Having a conversation doesn't sound like leaving. Well, so if they want me to leave
[9089.64s -> 9093.08s]  so bad, why would that guy have a full conversation about like the Lord of Light with
[9093.80s -> 9105.14s]  Get out of here, you piece of shit! You're a scumbag!
[9105.78s -> 9109.22s]  Hey, uh, so the Lord of Light- uh, let me give you some tips first, Bob, by the way.
[9109.22s -> 9113.30s]  So go- if you go- don't go to the Northwest. There's some scary guys up there. Be careful.
[9113.30s -> 9116.90s]  Oh, if you want to- one other tip. Uh, make sure you have enough supplies and-
[9117.54s -> 9119.70s]  Kill him! Murder him and his dog!
[9131.90s -> 9136.30s]  You sounded like a YouTuber there. Alright, where am I going? Where am I allowed to be?
[9138.52s -> 9147.06s]  Okay, here's the actual town. We're going to the actual city. It's right there.
[9147.70s -> 9157.80s]  I have too much armor. Yeah, but I'm building up strength. The YouTuber voice.
[9163.77s -> 9173.85s]  There's shit going on over there. Maybe I- they told me not to go up here,
[9175.16s -> 9177.88s]  but that kind of makes me want to go up here. Because
[9178.84s -> 9182.62s]  maybe they're just liars. It's a dog. Come on.
[9182.62s -> 9188.66s]  Oh, we gotta match speeds here, man. I'm like losing the dog.
[9189.46s -> 9211.30s]  Come on. Get over here. Quickly. We have to stick together.
[9212.02s -> 9223.19s]  There we go. You're gonna have 20 people in your squad.
[9223.91s -> 9227.03s]  That's actually insane. Maybe I should just make a camp or something.
[9228.15s -> 9233.06s]  What do you need for materials? To run your own camp.
[9233.06s -> 9243.80s]  The dog is the only smart one here. Okay. I'm gonna build a house over here.
[9253.64s -> 9256.12s]  There's so much to explore. I don't even know where to go.
[9256.12s -> 9258.28s]  I don't know what to do. I'm so overwhelmed.
[9258.28s -> 9261.16s]  I'm just gonna go this way, I guess, until I find another town?
[9261.88s -> 9270.62s]  Wait, hold on. Now, these are holy servants. We're fine.
[9271.26s -> 9279.38s]  How's my strength? Minus two? For what? Because I'm hungry.
[9279.46s -> 9289.61s]  Don't have any food on me. Just build a house. I can't. I need materials.
[9289.61s -> 9292.09s]  Are these holy? Holy servants. Yeah.
[9295.43s -> 9297.03s]  Southwest is a good starter area.
[9297.59s -> 9299.99s]  Well, that's gonna take me a long time to get there.
[9300.79s -> 9308.79s]  Okay, hold on. Should I just bang a U-turn and go down here?
[9308.79s -> 9317.27s]  I'm gonna go down here. Hey, hey, you're going too fast.
[9317.27s -> 9325.75s]  Going too fast. Stay with me. These guys hostile than not, right?
[9342.39s -> 9344.55s]  All right. Any huts? Any...
[9344.55s -> 9346.71s]  Okay, there is a congregation over here.
[9347.51s -> 9349.70s]  Discovered farm ruins.
[9349.70s -> 9354.42s]  There better be steaks and sodas and shit, like canned meat and stuff.
[9359.19s -> 9360.79s]  And this is taking me up.
[9366.81s -> 9368.33s]  See if we can find anything in the ruins.
[9368.97s -> 9376.46s]  All right. I don't see anything over here.
[9377.02s -> 9378.68s]  This looks fairly safe.
[9379.40s -> 9384.09s]  Is this a campfire? There's a fresh campfire here.
[9388.10s -> 9398.18s]  But that means there probably are supplies somewhere.
[9402.81s -> 9405.82s]  Hold alt? I am. I'm holding alt right now.
[9411.86s -> 9413.70s]  Nothing at this fresh campsite?
[9414.26s -> 9425.46s]  How can there be nothing at a fresh campsite?
[9425.46s -> 9433.00s]  What am I looting?
[9433.00s -> 9436.04s]  No, I don't have any meat in here.
[9436.04s -> 9454.07s]  Okay, that's a nice nap.
[9454.71s -> 9459.62s]  No, nothing else in these ruins.
[9463.48s -> 9464.92s]  Wait, is that like a... what's that?
[9466.52s -> 9467.24s]  Nothing.
[9467.24s -> 9468.73s]  Well, that sucks.
[9469.37s -> 9471.45s]  How can there be nothing in here?
[9473.99s -> 9475.67s]  Hold up, traveler.
[9475.67s -> 9477.11s]  Speak with me. Speak... whoa, whoa, whoa.
[9477.11s -> 9477.67s]  Speak with me.
[9478.31s -> 9483.96s]  Hello.
[9483.96s -> 9485.00s]  Love and devotion, brother.
[9485.00s -> 9486.12s]  Welcome to your motherland.
[9486.12s -> 9489.00s]  The sacred domain of the holy Lord Phoenix himself.
[9489.00s -> 9490.04s]  Blessed be his name.
[9490.04s -> 9492.92s]  Evil lurks in all shadows of the land.
[9492.92s -> 9494.92s]  But Okren watches over you here, brother.
[9494.92s -> 9497.80s]  Where you belong as a pure blood.
[9497.80s -> 9499.24s]  Okay, thanks.
[9499.24s -> 9500.04s]  Blessings on you.
[9500.04s -> 9501.16s]  I guess you want...
[9501.16s -> 9502.68s]  Blessings... I'm going to play the part here
[9502.68s -> 9504.12s]  because I'm wearing their uniform.
[9504.68s -> 9505.80s]  Blessings upon you, brother.
[9506.68s -> 9508.36s]  It's easy to find danger and lose your path
[9508.36s -> 9510.36s]  when you journey away from the holy cities, my brother.
[9511.08s -> 9512.76s]  Remember to stay true to your purity
[9512.76s -> 9515.16s]  and take refuge in the holy Lord Phoenix himself.
[9515.16s -> 9516.20s]  Blessed be his name.
[9516.20s -> 9516.70s]  I agree.
[9517.88s -> 9519.72s]  Now you look starved half to death.
[9519.80s -> 9520.44s]  Here, take this.
[9520.44s -> 9521.96s]  You need these rations more than I do.
[9521.96s -> 9522.84s]  Be well, brother.
[9524.46s -> 9525.34s]  Thank you so much.
[9526.58s -> 9529.99s]  Hey, take a look at this.
[9529.99s -> 9531.03s]  Rations. Food pack.
[9535.18s -> 9540.15s]  So this is free stuff.
[9542.15s -> 9542.79s]  Ingredients.
[9542.79s -> 9544.39s]  Food cube. Dried meat.
[9545.82s -> 9547.50s]  So I need to eat this right now.
[9548.22s -> 9549.61s]  How do we split it?
[9550.33s -> 9554.91s]  Pick up.
[9556.63s -> 9557.35s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[9557.35s -> 9558.15s]  Put the dog down.
[9560.92s -> 9561.96s]  Put the dog down.
[9562.92s -> 9565.16s]  Why is he carrying it like this?
[9565.16s -> 9566.68s]  How do I put the dog down?
[9568.30s -> 9571.32s]  Okay. Jesus.
[9572.86s -> 9575.02s]  They eat, you eat automatically.
[9575.02s -> 9577.16s]  You do?
[9577.70s -> 9583.50s]  You just eat it automatically.
[9583.50s -> 9584.22s]  Oh, okay.
[9584.86s -> 9587.39s]  All right.
[9587.85s -> 9590.84s]  Oh, you do.
[9590.84s -> 9591.32s]  All right.
[9591.32s -> 9591.82s]  Okay.
[9593.30s -> 9593.80s]  Nice.
[9595.38s -> 9596.42s]  First victory of the night
[9596.42s -> 9600.18s]  and it only took two hours and 41 minutes to find food
[9600.18s -> 9601.14s]  and I didn't even find it.
[9601.14s -> 9602.02s]  Somebody gave it to me.
[9602.66s -> 9604.34s]  Somebody entered my Dark Souls game
[9604.34s -> 9606.66s]  and dropped like 20 humanities on the ground
[9607.22s -> 9609.06s]  and then waved and fucking disconnected.
[9609.86s -> 9611.06s]  Hey, thanks.
[9615.42s -> 9616.30s]  I appreciate it.
[9622.31s -> 9623.67s]  Right. Let's see if there's anything here.
[9623.67s -> 9624.87s]  Let's zoom in on the map a little.
[9624.87s -> 9626.31s]  I want to see if there's any towns, man.
[9631.27s -> 9632.07s]  Farm ruins.
[9632.07s -> 9632.79s]  There's nothing there.
[9636.68s -> 9638.92s]  I was told not to go this way because it's dangerous
[9638.92s -> 9643.14s]  so I'm going to go this way.
[9643.70s -> 9645.98s]  We'll go around and down.
[9645.98s -> 9647.90s]  Well, once we hit the lake we're going to go down here
[9647.90s -> 9649.66s]  so let's just make our way this way.
[9650.46s -> 9657.78s]  I'm still in Paladin territory, I believe.
[9657.78s -> 9662.68s]  So feed your dog.
[9662.68s -> 9665.32s]  The dog eats at the same time as you, right?
[9665.96s -> 9667.98s]  Are we not sharing this food?
[9668.62s -> 9669.90s]  No, we're not sharing the food.
[9670.70s -> 9673.16s]  Wait, why?
[9673.96s -> 9680.38s]  I got to put the food in the dog's inventory.
[9681.02s -> 9686.84s]  How do I keep them both open at the same time?
[9687.40s -> 9696.31s]  The dog can't eat from your inventory.
[9696.31s -> 9698.47s]  You have to drop it on the floor and put it
[9698.47s -> 9700.23s]  or put it in your backpack which you don't have.
[9700.95s -> 9716.74s]  Okay.
[9718.52s -> 9727.77s]  What happened?
[9727.77s -> 9729.05s]  Who ate the ration pack?
[9734.33s -> 9735.29s]  He ate it.
[9735.29s -> 9737.13s]  Well, why is he still at 130?
[9737.69s -> 9753.80s]  He ate the whole pack.
[9753.80s -> 9754.52s]  He ate the...
[9754.52s -> 9755.96s]  You ate all of our rations.
[9755.96s -> 9756.92s]  That's all we had.
[9758.52s -> 9758.84s]  What?
[9762.10s -> 9765.14s]  Of course, you can't like leave food on the ground, guys.
[9767.48s -> 9769.24s]  Yeah, just take like 20 sandwiches
[9769.24s -> 9770.36s]  and put them down on the floor
[9770.36s -> 9772.28s]  and your dog will just eat one of them.
[9772.28s -> 9777.86s]  This is the way I wanted to go.
[9777.86s -> 9779.46s]  No, I wanted to wrap around here.
[9779.46s -> 9789.13s]  All right, we're fine.
[9793.46s -> 9795.30s]  I wanted to go around this way
[9796.02s -> 9797.96s]  so I kind of went the wrong way.
[9800.89s -> 9802.65s]  Dog equals food.
[9802.65s -> 9803.85s]  No, that's not going to happen.
[9803.85s -> 9804.81s]  I'm not going to eat the dog.
[9805.69s -> 9808.71s]  You probably can't even eat the dog.
[9815.00s -> 9815.72s]  Something over there.
[9816.36s -> 9817.40s]  What's that?
[9818.04s -> 9819.69s]  Distraction.
[9819.69s -> 9820.09s]  Let's see.
[9824.58s -> 9825.22s]  Dog?
[9825.22s -> 9827.77s]  What are you doing?
[9827.77s -> 9832.92s]  What's wrong with it?
[9832.92s -> 9834.12s]  Oh, okay, you got stuck.
[9836.60s -> 9837.40s]  All right, let's take a look.
[9838.97s -> 9840.57s]  Holding alt, looking around,
[9840.57s -> 9841.69s]  seeing if I can find the items
[9842.41s -> 9844.25s]  in this broken down house.
[9846.78s -> 9847.90s]  Oh, perma jobs.
[9850.10s -> 9851.22s]  You can organize your squad
[9851.22s -> 9853.14s]  by assigning them jobs in the orders menu.
[9853.86s -> 9856.70s]  It's especially useful for farms, mines,
[9857.34s -> 9858.38s]  and other production jobs
[9858.38s -> 9860.06s]  since assigned characters will automatically store
[9860.06s -> 9861.74s]  and replenish raw materials as they work.
[9862.94s -> 9863.56s]  Okay.
[9864.36s -> 9866.84s]  Well, it's the holy servants.
[9866.84s -> 9868.60s]  To assign a job, select a character,
[9868.60s -> 9870.36s]  then hold shift while clicking
[9870.36s -> 9871.56s]  to interact with the object
[9871.56s -> 9873.00s]  or building you wish to assign them to.
[9873.88s -> 9880.46s]  Okay, hold shift while right clicking
[9881.02s -> 9881.90s]  and on an object.
[9882.70s -> 9885.13s]  Then you can assign a job.
[9885.93s -> 9889.16s]  You can give characters multiple jobs.
[9889.16s -> 9891.16s]  Top most jobs in the orders menu
[9891.16s -> 9892.60s]  will always take priority.
[9892.60s -> 9894.87s]  Okay.
[9895.51s -> 9897.18s]  You can remove a job at any time
[9897.18s -> 9898.30s]  by pressing it on the X.
[9898.30s -> 9899.98s]  So why did it tell me?
[9903.16s -> 9903.96s]  Really?
[9903.96s -> 9905.74s]  Can you do this?
[9906.30s -> 9912.95s]  What am I getting from this?
[9913.83s -> 9921.16s]  Am I going to get materials?
[9927.38s -> 9928.82s]  Do I have a progress bar?
[9933.46s -> 9934.66s]  I'm being a real dwarf.
[9938.89s -> 9941.05s]  Is this completely futile?
[9941.61s -> 9945.48s]  I'll just show this left click on the thing.
[9946.78s -> 9947.26s]  Output.
[9948.22s -> 9948.54s]  Copper.
[9950.94s -> 9952.14s]  Proper quality.
[9952.14s -> 9952.46s]  20.
[9955.54s -> 9956.74s]  Workers, zero out of two.
[9960.42s -> 9961.78s]  This is the progress bar?
[9978.44s -> 9979.40s]  I'm not mining them.
[9979.40s -> 9980.52s]  I'm mining something else.
[9984.81s -> 9986.81s]  Okay, that's the one.
[9990.97s -> 9993.29s]  I'm going to build a house right here.
[9993.29s -> 9996.20s]  I'm going to build a fire.
[9996.20s -> 9996.92s]  I'm going to build a house.
[9997.64s -> 10002.34s]  You are so stupid.
[10002.34s -> 10004.90s]  My two-year-old sister has a higher IQ.
[10004.90s -> 10005.14s]  What?
[10005.14s -> 10006.82s]  Because I didn't know which...
[10007.38s -> 10008.66s]  What do you mean copper?
[10009.22s -> 10011.43s]  How was I supposed to know?
[10011.43s -> 10013.51s]  Like they're all the same thing.
[10015.50s -> 10016.22s]  Look at this.
[10016.22s -> 10017.82s]  Like I don't even know which one
[10017.82s -> 10018.78s]  I'm standing in front of.
[10020.81s -> 10022.57s]  It's apparently this one here.
[10022.57s -> 10023.29s]  I'm here.
[10023.29s -> 10023.93s]  It's over here.
[10024.57s -> 10032.41s]  All right.
[10032.41s -> 10033.77s]  You need to like patrol or something.
[10038.10s -> 10038.98s]  Mine with the dog?
[10038.98s -> 10039.30s]  I can't.
[10040.26s -> 10042.34s]  He doesn't have opposable thumbs.
[10042.34s -> 10042.90s]  He can't do it.
[10043.54s -> 10047.98s]  Oh no, he's got the zombies.
[10048.62s -> 10050.54s]  Did I get something?
[10050.54s -> 10058.04s]  Why did I stop?
[10058.04s -> 10069.24s]  I'm doing fine.
[10077.02s -> 10078.30s]  I kind of have to get this, right?
[10089.02s -> 10090.46s]  Yeah, this is like the point of the game.
[10092.71s -> 10094.95s]  You just are a piece of shit.
[10094.95s -> 10096.31s]  You can't do anything.
[10096.31s -> 10114.58s]  You should find a town before mining.
[10114.58s -> 10116.34s]  Well, I almost have one copper bar
[10116.34s -> 10118.26s]  that I'm going to get ripped off of my person.
[10118.98s -> 10127.67s]  It's taking me almost a full day.
[10127.67s -> 10128.07s]  Come on.
[10133.94s -> 10135.06s]  Paladins were fine.
[10135.06s -> 10140.94s]  Which one is this again?
[10141.94s -> 10142.34s]  Copper.
[10142.34s -> 10142.66s]  Got it.
[10144.09s -> 10145.13s]  Average price, 100.
[10146.54s -> 10146.94s]  Thank you.
[10147.74s -> 10149.34s]  Yep.
[10149.34s -> 10151.34s]  Valuable metal used in high-tech machinery.
[10151.98s -> 10159.03s]  Get another one.
[10159.03s -> 10159.83s]  Mercenary plate?
[10159.83s -> 10160.55s]  Where did I get this?
[10161.83s -> 10162.87s]  Oh, right.
[10162.87s -> 10165.50s]  That was so pointless.
[10166.68s -> 10167.24s]  No, there's...
[10168.36s -> 10169.40s]  I'm going to get three.
[10170.04s -> 10170.28s]  Okay.
[10171.00s -> 10177.61s]  There's no room?
[10178.33s -> 10179.21s]  I can move.
[10179.21s -> 10180.81s]  I'm a Diablo II veteran, guys.
[10181.61s -> 10182.65s]  I'll make room.
[10182.65s -> 10193.69s]  You say no more room.
[10193.69s -> 10213.29s]  Where is...
[10216.41s -> 10217.85s]  Stalling streamer.
[10217.85s -> 10218.57s]  This is part...
[10218.57s -> 10219.77s]  I have to do this shit.
[10220.17s -> 10222.09s]  It's not like I'm just going to skip this.
[10222.09s -> 10226.36s]  Let's take a look at the mining level.
[10226.92s -> 10232.15s]  All right.
[10232.15s -> 10235.75s]  We got combat range, thievery, sciences, trades.
[10238.70s -> 10239.50s]  Is it even on here?
[10240.87s -> 10244.76s]  Field medic, laboring, laboring.
[10244.76s -> 10245.00s]  Okay.
[10249.91s -> 10250.87s]  Laboring nine.
[10250.87s -> 10251.67s]  I'm very good.
[10252.74s -> 10255.70s]  Scale of general manual labor such as mining
[10255.70s -> 10257.14s]  and using simple machinery.
[10262.58s -> 10263.22s]  Level 10.
[10263.22s -> 10263.62s]  Coming up.
[10264.71s -> 10265.51s]  Ways to train.
[10265.51s -> 10266.15s]  Work hard.
[10266.79s -> 10280.30s]  I'm making up for all the slave work that I did not do.
[10287.99s -> 10290.39s]  If I get this game, I can start the game as a slave
[10290.39s -> 10291.51s]  and work my way to freedom.
[10291.51s -> 10291.75s]  Yes.
[10293.75s -> 10295.99s]  You're not supposed to do anything good in this game.
[10296.79s -> 10299.27s]  You're supposed to be a aunt of a person.
[10304.12s -> 10305.24s]  And not only am I doing this,
[10305.24s -> 10311.82s]  I'm doing this with full armor on.
[10311.82s -> 10313.18s]  Did I say this joke sucks?
[10316.81s -> 10318.06s]  What joke?
[10318.06s -> 10318.86s]  This is the game.
[10318.86s -> 10319.82s]  This is the stream, man.
[10319.82s -> 10322.78s]  We're fucking mining for copper bars.
[10326.02s -> 10326.42s]  All right.
[10326.42s -> 10327.30s]  How close am I?
[10331.29s -> 10331.69s]  Got one.
[10332.68s -> 10332.92s]  All right.
[10332.92s -> 10333.40s]  One more.
[10335.69s -> 10336.97s]  I can get rid of this hat.
[10336.97s -> 10337.61s]  I don't need this.
[10338.33s -> 10340.09s]  Value 10 cents.
[10340.09s -> 10340.57s]  No thanks.
[10341.37s -> 10343.51s]  These things are like 180 bucks.
[10361.45s -> 10362.17s]  Please stop.
[10362.17s -> 10363.29s]  This is not a bit.
[10363.29s -> 10366.01s]  I'm mining for materials.
[10366.01s -> 10367.45s]  I need the materials.
[10369.91s -> 10371.59s]  I'm not doing like a look at how long
[10371.59s -> 10372.63s]  I've been sitting here for.
[10372.63s -> 10374.31s]  Isn't that fucking hilarious?
[10375.13s -> 10378.97s]  No, I'm trying to get three copper bars
[10378.97s -> 10382.01s]  so I can use them how they're intended.
[10382.01s -> 10383.53s]  To smash somebody over the head with them
[10383.53s -> 10384.65s]  because they're just big rocks
[10384.65s -> 10385.85s]  and then throw them in the trash.
[10386.65s -> 10393.00s]  Okay, we're done.
[10393.00s -> 10394.23s]  That's it.
[10394.79s -> 10397.03s]  I got what I wanted.
[10397.03s -> 10399.11s]  I got three dinosaur eggs.
[10399.11s -> 10400.39s]  My three dragons.
[10428.28s -> 10430.12s]  They're going to net you 10 copper.
[10431.32s -> 10432.44s]  No, look at the price.
[10433.24s -> 10435.88s]  194 cents.
[10435.88s -> 10442.78s]  The cave up here.
[10442.78s -> 10458.94s]  Put a face cam on to replace world's end.
[10458.94s -> 10460.30s]  Go south, not north.
[10460.30s -> 10462.92s]  I beg you.
[10462.92s -> 10465.16s]  Stop acting like an idiot.
[10465.16s -> 10465.56s]  All right.
[10465.56s -> 10469.72s]  Look, I want to make this really clear.
[10469.72s -> 10472.12s]  I don't know what's up here.
[10472.98s -> 10476.36s]  If you do, I don't have that information.
[10476.92s -> 10478.44s]  How would I have that information?
[10480.10s -> 10484.25s]  Because I'm going this way.
[10484.25s -> 10485.21s]  No, go this way.
[10485.21s -> 10487.85s]  I know what's down here.
[10487.85s -> 10488.49s]  I don't what?
[10491.91s -> 10494.55s]  I know that there's like evil demons up here
[10494.55s -> 10496.63s]  but like I can't go this way.
[10500.23s -> 10502.63s]  Why can't I go like over here?
[10502.63s -> 10504.07s]  I have to go down here.
[10504.07s -> 10505.03s]  Why can't I go over here?
[10512.07s -> 10513.99s]  They told me not to go up this way
[10513.99s -> 10515.59s]  but like I'm not going this way.
[10515.59s -> 10516.79s]  I'm going like this way.
[10517.43s -> 10519.03s]  I'm going from here to here.
[10519.43s -> 10528.06s]  You know what I mean?
[10528.06s -> 10529.66s]  Like I'm not like going up.
[10529.66s -> 10534.07s]  I'm going like down there.
[10534.07s -> 10535.03s]  That's the plan.
[10540.79s -> 10542.79s]  But I want it to like wrap around here though.
[10542.79s -> 10545.29s]  I want to like go this way
[10545.29s -> 10546.33s]  because there's a lake here.
[10546.33s -> 10547.53s]  There's like a river and shit.
[10547.53s -> 10548.41s]  I want to see what this is.
[10553.46s -> 10555.38s]  Look, I understand this is one of those games
[10555.38s -> 10560.50s]  where like there's no way I could know what anything is.
[10560.50s -> 10562.66s]  And if I'm going to stumble upon something fucking weird
[10562.66s -> 10563.78s]  that's what's going to happen.
[10563.78s -> 10566.02s]  I don't need to know like exactly where to go.
[10566.82s -> 10570.20s]  There's no information in the game
[10570.20s -> 10571.64s]  besides like when people tell you.
[10571.64s -> 10572.20s]  You know what I mean?
[10572.92s -> 10577.56s]  Look, his world's end.
[10578.28s -> 10579.16s]  I want to see what this is.
[10579.80s -> 10599.99s]  He doesn't know where everything is
[10600.71s -> 10603.91s]  because there's the guard post, right?
[10611.75s -> 10613.83s]  Pick up the dog and carry the dog.
[10614.39s -> 10621.98s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10621.98s -> 10623.90s]  No, he's a holy servant.
[10623.90s -> 10624.70s]  That's fine.
[10624.70s -> 10634.41s]  All right, hold on.
[10634.41s -> 10635.53s]  So what is this?
[10636.81s -> 10637.77s]  This is all the way up here?
[10638.33s -> 10647.10s]  Am I going to scale this whole mountain?
[10647.66s -> 10649.32s]  Oh, hold on.
[10649.32s -> 10651.13s]  Important.
[10651.13s -> 10667.94s]  This is not going to take as long.
[10667.94s -> 10678.82s]  Put your face cam over the character's face.
[10678.82s -> 10695.88s]  I don't know.
[10695.88s -> 10696.28s]  Hold on.
[10696.28s -> 10697.40s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10697.40s -> 10698.60s]  I can't even bring it back now.
[10699.08s -> 10701.69s]  My hands are off.
[10701.69s -> 10702.89s]  I can't even do anything.
[10702.89s -> 10711.40s]  Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me.
[10711.40s -> 10711.72s]  Really?
[10715.98s -> 10717.42s]  I'm all the way like the edge of the map.
[10717.42s -> 10718.46s]  I can't even move.
[10718.46s -> 10728.57s]  Got it.
[10728.57s -> 10729.13s]  Okay.
[10729.13s -> 10732.18s]  Where was I running?
[10732.18s -> 10734.82s]  Did I get the material?
[10734.82s -> 10735.46s]  Oh, fuck.
[10735.46s -> 10736.98s]  I don't have any room for this shit.
[10736.98s -> 10737.62s]  All right, hold on.
[10757.96s -> 10758.60s]  There.
[10758.60s -> 10759.32s]  Better?
[10759.32s -> 10759.88s]  Are we good?
[10770.63s -> 10771.91s]  Why is that so funny?
[10784.76s -> 10786.68s]  I don't have enough inventory space for this shit.
[10786.68s -> 10787.40s]  Hold on.
[10787.40s -> 10788.60s]  What can I do with this?
[10788.60s -> 10791.99s]  I can move this over here.
[10791.99s -> 10792.31s]  Hold on.
[10792.31s -> 10797.78s]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[10797.78s -> 10798.66s]  They stack.
[10798.66s -> 10805.02s]  No, they don't.
[10805.02s -> 10805.34s]  Fuck.
[10805.34s -> 10806.14s]  Okay.
[10806.14s -> 10809.85s]  Just scared the shit out of me.
[10812.58s -> 10813.62s]  I can't carry this anymore.
[10814.66s -> 10815.46s]  How much is this worth?
[10816.02s -> 10816.90s]  32.
[10816.90s -> 10817.22s]  No.
[10817.22s -> 10818.42s]  Why would I just...
[10818.42s -> 10819.64s]  What happened?
[10819.64s -> 10822.09s]  Okay.
[10822.09s -> 10823.53s]  This is worth a lot.
[10823.53s -> 10824.68s]  That's worth 1,000...
[10824.68s -> 10825.72s]  That's worth 1,700.
[10833.62s -> 10834.10s]  Backpack?
[10834.10s -> 10835.14s]  I don't have a backpack though.
[10837.62s -> 10841.03s]  Like, I don't have a backpack.
[10841.03s -> 10842.23s]  I can't put anything in my backpack.
[10842.23s -> 10843.27s]  I don't have one.
[10843.27s -> 10845.29s]  The dog inventory.
[10845.29s -> 10846.33s]  I don't think he can carry them.
[10846.97s -> 10859.69s]  What can the dog have on his back?
[10859.69s -> 10862.36s]  The dog is dying.
[10862.36s -> 10863.16s]  Feed the dog.
[10865.80s -> 10868.04s]  I don't have any food to feed the dog.
[10869.18s -> 10870.30s]  Oh, shit.
[10870.30s -> 10870.86s]  Okay, hold on.
[10870.86s -> 10872.62s]  I gotta get one more fucking rock.
[10873.26s -> 10877.21s]  All right, let's go.
[10884.30s -> 10885.26s]  Where the hell?
[10886.65s -> 10887.93s]  This is so far away.
[10888.49s -> 10890.04s]  Do I have any...
[10890.04s -> 10890.84s]  Can I eat anything?
[10891.48s -> 10895.13s]  I spent all the time mining and not getting any food.
[10898.07s -> 10899.43s]  There is a town up here.
[10899.43s -> 10900.31s]  Let's go.
[10900.31s -> 10900.71s]  Quickly.
[10915.46s -> 10917.14s]  Come on, we're gonna get you some food, dog.
[10924.28s -> 10925.24s]  You're okay, you're all right.
[10925.24s -> 10926.20s]  You're gonna be fine.
[10926.20s -> 10928.70s]  I just gotta get you up here.
[10928.70s -> 10940.09s]  Go on.
[10940.09s -> 10953.51s]  What was that?
[10953.51s -> 10954.95s]  I just saw something on the screen.
[10954.95s -> 10960.06s]  Put a picture of Otto in the dog portrait.
[10960.06s -> 10961.74s]  No, because if this dog dies, I'm gonna be sad
[10961.74s -> 10962.86s]  because it was supposed to be Otto.
[10962.86s -> 10963.42s]  No.
[10963.42s -> 10977.74s]  I feel like I'm losing my grip on the dog.
[10977.74s -> 10980.46s]  I need to eat too.
[10980.46s -> 10982.44s]  Bad.
[10982.44s -> 10983.56s]  There is a town up here.
[10985.38s -> 10986.74s]  Somewhere up here.
[10986.74s -> 11001.72s]  Don't tell me I have to scale the entire mountain.
[11001.72s -> 11003.72s]  How high up is this place?
[11003.72s -> 11005.00s]  I'm at almost zero.
[11005.00s -> 11006.04s]  I'm gonna pass out.
[11006.04s -> 11020.73s]  Should I throw off the armor?
[11020.73s -> 11029.51s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[11029.51s -> 11030.31s]  I'm almost there.
[11030.31s -> 11036.52s]  I'm almost at the front door.
[11036.52s -> 11039.16s]  61, 98, we're good.
[11039.16s -> 11046.28s]  Just get me up there.
[11046.28s -> 11047.16s]  Throw away armor.
[11047.16s -> 11048.52s]  I'm right there.
[11048.52s -> 11049.08s]  Look at this.
[11049.08s -> 11050.84s]  I'm standing in front of the gates.
[11058.41s -> 11059.85s]  The weight is doubling your hunger rate.
[11059.85s -> 11060.57s]  But that's all right though.
[11060.57s -> 11062.17s]  It's giving me extra power, extra points.
[11063.86s -> 11065.70s]  I am persevering through this shit
[11065.70s -> 11067.38s]  and it's gonna give me more points in the long run.
[11068.10s -> 11068.58s]  Here we go.
[11069.22s -> 11073.93s]  All right, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it.
[11073.93s -> 11075.05s]  These are tech hunters.
[11076.39s -> 11076.79s]  Okay.
[11077.35s -> 11079.27s]  Look, I got a fucking sick dog here.
[11084.12s -> 11085.96s]  Okay, what can I save it
[11085.96s -> 11087.24s]  just in case something horrible happens?
[11096.01s -> 11096.65s]  Anybody?
[11096.65s -> 11097.53s]  I can just come in here?
[11097.53s -> 11098.73s]  Okay, they're not gonna like
[11098.73s -> 11100.25s]  throw me in a dungeon or anything, right?
[11103.05s -> 11103.45s]  Perfect.
[11103.45s -> 11103.77s]  Got it.
[11103.77s -> 11104.33s]  Okay, quick.
[11106.14s -> 11106.46s]  Food.
[11107.83s -> 11108.15s]  Shop.
[11108.87s -> 11110.07s]  Because that's a men's room.
[11110.07s -> 11111.35s]  I don't have to go to the bathroom or anything.
[11111.35s -> 11111.59s]  Bar.
[11119.66s -> 11120.62s]  Okay, let's get in here.
[11123.90s -> 11125.34s]  Sell the armor to this guy.
[11125.98s -> 11133.00s]  Okay.
[11136.81s -> 11137.21s]  Talk to.
[11138.50s -> 11139.14s]  Let's trade.
[11143.11s -> 11143.99s]  Metal plate.
[11143.99s -> 11144.47s]  Here it is.
[11145.75s -> 11148.55s]  Value, it's 17.85.
[11149.27s -> 11151.83s]  I'm gonna get 4.46 for it.
[11151.83s -> 11159.83s]  Where's my money?
[11159.83s -> 11164.86s]  How do I sell it to him?
[11164.86s -> 11165.18s]  Got it.
[11165.18s -> 11165.98s]  Okay, how much money?
[11167.30s -> 11170.17s]  Okay, how much are these?
[11170.17s -> 11171.77s]  You're gonna give me 97, 97.
[11171.93s -> 11173.37s]  I mean, I gotta get food and shit, man.
[11175.66s -> 11176.86s]  I can't just not have food.
[11177.85s -> 11178.65s]  We gotta sell it all.
[11181.56s -> 11182.12s]  I need money.
[11187.02s -> 11188.94s]  And take this fucking dumb weapon too.
[11191.29s -> 11192.25s]  Maybe I should sell this.
[11194.49s -> 11195.37s]  What do you think?
[11195.37s -> 11199.11s]  I think I'm gonna sell the armor as well.
[11201.74s -> 11203.26s]  But I need food first.
[11204.23s -> 11204.95s]  Dog needs it now.
[11204.95s -> 11205.35s]  Let's go.
[11206.07s -> 11219.88s]  Okay, I need, I need like a general store.
[11219.88s -> 11220.60s]  All right, the bar.
[11223.42s -> 11225.02s]  This is so brutal.
[11225.02s -> 11235.93s]  I don't, the dog's up.
[11235.93s -> 11236.57s]  The dog is up.
[11236.57s -> 11237.29s]  The dog is okay.
[11237.77s -> 11240.02s]  I'm only unconscious for 15 seconds.
[11240.02s -> 11247.26s]  All right, come on.
[11247.26s -> 11251.64s]  Come on, just crawl to the bar and buy a fucking pretzel.
[11253.22s -> 11254.66s]  Go, go, go.
[11254.66s -> 11261.05s]  Get in here.
[11261.05s -> 11262.65s]  What in the name of God?
[11262.65s -> 11263.21s]  What happened?
[11263.77s -> 11267.53s]  I just clicked a fucking ad on a webpage.
[11268.09s -> 11269.19s]  All right, I need a bar.
[11269.75s -> 11271.83s]  Bartender, hello?
[11277.53s -> 11279.37s]  Where is, I'm just stealing it.
[11281.70s -> 11282.18s]  All right.
[11282.18s -> 11285.48s]  Yeah, hey, heading out of town looking to join up.
[11285.48s -> 11288.39s]  Yeah, it'll be 3,000 cats.
[11288.95s -> 11293.16s]  Where's the, where do I just buy something?
[11297.74s -> 11301.05s]  Right here.
[11301.05s -> 11301.93s]  Uh, show me your goods.
[11301.93s -> 11302.33s]  Here we go.
[11302.33s -> 11305.77s]  All right, bread, cheese, meat, tacos, meat wrap.
[11305.77s -> 11310.58s]  How much is this?
[11310.58s -> 11313.46s]  It's 316 for the meat wraps.
[11313.46s -> 11314.58s]  How much is bread?
[11314.58s -> 11317.94s]  This is so much money.
[11317.94s -> 11318.90s]  How much do I even have?
[11319.70s -> 11325.42s]  13, okay, hold on.
[11325.42s -> 11326.38s]  Meat and bread.
[11326.38s -> 11329.43s]  Okay, I just ate it.
[11329.43s -> 11332.94s]  I don't have enough money.
[11332.94s -> 11335.62s]  Okay, where's the dog?
[11336.44s -> 11346.60s]  Come here, dog.
[11346.60s -> 11347.80s]  Where's the dog?
[11347.80s -> 11354.66s]  Come here.
[11354.66s -> 11355.38s]  Eat it.
[11355.38s -> 11356.89s]  How do I feed the dog?
[11356.89s -> 11367.29s]  Did you get it?
[11367.29s -> 11367.93s]  You got it.
[11367.93s -> 11374.55s]  Okay, we're good.
[11374.63s -> 11377.75s]  You're three times idling right now.
[11377.75s -> 11379.50s]  They're both eating.
[11379.50s -> 11381.34s]  They're both hungry still, but it's okay.
[11381.34s -> 11383.51s]  I need to make some more money.
[11388.60s -> 11389.80s]  Now let's go back up here.
[11390.60s -> 11392.44s]  I gotta sell some more stuff, I think.
[11392.44s -> 11400.89s]  I can't like, hold on the alt key to steal.
[11400.89s -> 11401.45s]  I'm not doing that.
[11402.31s -> 11404.55s]  All right, talk to, let's trade.
[11406.04s -> 11416.92s]  Um, dried meat is so, so much cheaper than everything else.
[11416.92s -> 11420.52s]  And I spent 300 fucking dollars when I could have just bought this.
[11423.46s -> 11425.22s]  Hey, are you stealing my dog?
[11426.26s -> 11427.30s]  Why are you taking my dog?
[11429.35s -> 11429.67s]  What?
[11429.67s -> 11430.39s]  What's going on?
[11434.30s -> 11435.18s]  What's happening?
[11439.48s -> 11450.42s]  Oh no, the dog's not allowed inside?
[11450.98s -> 11454.33s]  All right, so they've eaten.
[11455.13s -> 11459.83s]  Okay, we're good.
[11463.58s -> 11464.38s]  Bodyguard.
[11465.02s -> 11469.10s]  Here, eat it.
[11469.66s -> 11473.14s]  Eat the meat.
[11477.10s -> 11482.76s]  Did they not want it right now?
[11482.76s -> 11483.48s]  I think they're okay.
[11484.66s -> 11487.24s]  So what, do you only have to eat just one time?
[11487.24s -> 11488.36s]  Eat for yourself, I already did.
[11488.92s -> 11492.41s]  I already ate earlier.
[11492.41s -> 11494.49s]  I guess, can you eat more than one time to speed up?
[11494.49s -> 11495.05s]  I already ate.
[11495.53s -> 11498.82s]  Load the game and buy all the cheap shit.
[11499.46s -> 11503.72s]  It was poisoned.
[11508.42s -> 11511.46s]  The dog keeps passing out and waking up.
[11512.10s -> 11515.13s]  I bought the expensive fucking food.
[11517.38s -> 11518.98s]  You can't eat until the bar stops.
[11518.98s -> 11519.70s]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[11525.38s -> 11527.30s]  All right, I got an idea.
[11527.86s -> 11535.08s]  It's worth doing.
[11535.64s -> 11536.20s]  I don't care.
[11536.92s -> 11562.25s]  There's so much shit to take.
[11562.25s -> 11563.05s]  Chew sticks.
[11565.85s -> 11567.53s]  Nobody can see me right now.
[11567.53s -> 11570.71s]  All right, we got Saki.
[11571.27s -> 11572.31s]  Took it.
[11572.31s -> 11573.27s]  Committing crime.
[11573.27s -> 11574.23s]  Oh, please.
[11574.23s -> 11575.51s]  I don't care.
[11575.51s -> 11576.07s]  Water.
[11576.07s -> 11576.47s]  Cactus.
[11579.46s -> 11580.34s]  Hacksaw.
[11580.34s -> 11581.70s]  Nobody's seeing this.
[11582.26s -> 11586.12s]  Chew stick.
[11586.12s -> 11586.60s]  Let's just see.
[11586.60s -> 11587.16s]  Let's go over here.
[11592.01s -> 11593.69s]  Red.
[11593.69s -> 11594.57s]  Chew sticks.
[11594.57s -> 11595.21s]  Chew sticks.
[11595.77s -> 11596.57s]  I can't pick that up.
[11596.57s -> 11597.29s]  Be too far away?
[11600.68s -> 11601.32s]  Am I visible?
[11601.32s -> 11601.72s]  No.
[11601.72s -> 11602.28s]  Chew sticks.
[11602.92s -> 11605.45s]  Why do I, what did I pick?
[11605.45s -> 11606.25s]  I'm going to go sell this.
[11607.72s -> 11609.56s]  This water jug is huge.
[11609.56s -> 11613.88s]  Okay, I got food.
[11615.00s -> 11615.72s]  Chew sticks.
[11616.71s -> 11617.43s]  Meat.
[11617.43s -> 11618.23s]  Saki.
[11618.23s -> 11622.33s]  Let's go sell the hacksaw back to the person that I just came here from.
[11622.33s -> 11626.95s]  No, actually, I can't do that because they know.
[11627.51s -> 11632.31s]  How many times does this dog keep passing out?
[11632.79s -> 11633.59s]  And waking up.
[11636.74s -> 11639.30s]  Fuck.
[11639.30s -> 11640.18s]  Nobody can see this.
[11640.74s -> 11642.81s]  All right, let me get up.
[11654.04s -> 11657.32s]  I don't have enough money, but I can't, I'm not going to sell to you.
[11658.20s -> 11659.54s]  Let's do business.
[11659.54s -> 11660.34s]  It'll say, right?
[11662.17s -> 11663.93s]  Stolen from you.
[11663.93s -> 11664.81s]  Fencing chance.
[11664.81s -> 11665.77s]  10 percent.
[11665.77s -> 11667.13s]  So, no, that's not going to work.
[11667.77s -> 11678.76s]  I need to get that huge, I feel so bad for the dog.
[11681.91s -> 11682.87s]  All right, let's go.
[11683.75s -> 11689.91s]  Still, the hunger is still going up though.
[11690.55s -> 11693.61s]  So, eventually, the dog will be okay.
[11695.91s -> 11704.33s]  Let's go sleep somewhere.
[11704.33s -> 11706.26s]  You know what I mean?
[11706.26s -> 11708.71s]  What do we got?
[11708.71s -> 11709.59s]  This is armory.
[11710.79s -> 11712.55s]  I'm going to sell, I have to sell this.
[11712.55s -> 11718.65s]  I have to because I just don't, wait, it's, everything's locked.
[11723.26s -> 11724.06s]  That's a bar.
[11724.06s -> 11725.10s]  We've been in somewhere.
[11730.31s -> 11732.23s]  Sell that guy the water from across the street.
[11732.95s -> 11736.17s]  I mean, I can't really do that.
[11736.73s -> 11741.02s]  It's a lot of bars.
[11741.02s -> 11743.59s]  Yeah, it looks like a weapon shop.
[11745.54s -> 11746.10s]  Tools.
[11747.99s -> 11748.31s]  Bar.
[11749.11s -> 11752.26s]  Where can I sleep?
[11755.10s -> 11756.06s]  Traveler?
[11756.14s -> 11759.26s]  That's a guy with a backpack and a walking stick.
[11759.26s -> 11761.26s]  That's like, travelers, welcome, right?
[11761.26s -> 11762.30s]  Okay, let's try it.
[11762.86s -> 11772.90s]  The bar, bars have beds.
[11772.90s -> 11777.78s]  Okay, so let me talk to who's in charge here.
[11784.26s -> 11785.70s]  I don't think either one of you are in charge.
[11786.42s -> 11786.82s]  You are.
[11787.46s -> 11791.03s]  What's the percentage chance that I can sell to you?
[11791.75s -> 11795.38s]  Why am I going this far around?
[11796.10s -> 11800.06s]  John, what you got?
[11801.61s -> 11802.25s]  Backpack.
[11803.93s -> 11804.97s]  Robotic arms.
[11806.01s -> 11807.05s]  Skeleton legs.
[11807.05s -> 11807.93s]  Skeleton arms.
[11809.34s -> 11810.06s]  Fencing chance.
[11810.06s -> 11810.38s]  20%.
[11810.94s -> 11811.82s]  That's not going to work.
[11812.38s -> 11815.10s]  I got to go to a different town.
[11815.10s -> 11815.90s]  I need more money.
[11820.58s -> 11832.86s]  Poor dog.
[11832.86s -> 11834.54s]  It just keeps getting picked up.
[11837.46s -> 11837.94s]  Leather.
[11837.94s -> 11839.14s]  Leather, but I can't carry this.
[11839.14s -> 11840.02s]  I need a backpack.
[11842.26s -> 11843.30s]  Splint kit.
[11843.30s -> 11844.18s]  Chain mail sheets.
[11844.18s -> 11845.30s]  Wooden bowl.
[11845.30s -> 11847.78s]  No, I'm just going to have to...
[11848.66s -> 11849.62s]  Here's what's going to have to happen.
[11849.62s -> 11850.66s]  I'm just going to have to let the...
[11850.66s -> 11851.94s]  I'm going to have to sleep in the bar.
[11853.14s -> 11860.47s]  And then hopefully when we get up, I'll feel better.
[11861.19s -> 11863.13s]  How much is a room at the inn?
[11865.06s -> 11865.78s]  Is it expensive?
[11865.78s -> 11868.02s]  Can I afford it or can I just sleep in here?
[11873.03s -> 11874.55s]  Don't idle in times three speed.
[11875.27s -> 11875.67s]  Was I?
[11879.08s -> 11879.88s]  Sitting pillow.
[11882.38s -> 11885.02s]  Okay, well I can't sleep in this, but maybe I can go upstairs?
[11885.02s -> 11885.82s]  Are there beds upstairs?
[11886.54s -> 11895.34s]  Where's the dog?
[11896.68s -> 11897.24s]  Dog spine.
[11902.50s -> 11903.38s]  There are beds up here.
[11903.94s -> 11904.74s]  Are they usable?
[11905.38s -> 11907.86s]  Everyone just got up at the same time as if they're about to all shout like,
[11907.86s -> 11908.18s]  Stop!
[11913.37s -> 11915.37s]  200 fucking C for a bed.
[11928.78s -> 11929.66s]  I need more money.
[11932.06s -> 11934.22s]  This is why I needed to mine more shit.
[11940.17s -> 11942.89s]  You just had to have those expensive sausages.
[11942.89s -> 11944.49s]  I just didn't realize that they were...
[11945.74s -> 11947.26s]  Everything was so expensive.
[11949.05s -> 11954.73s]  Like, okay, the scale that I had there was sausages
[11954.73s -> 11957.29s]  and the bread was fucking 250 cents.
[11958.01s -> 11960.76s]  I already...
[11960.76s -> 11963.48s]  Look, I already fed the dog.
[11963.48s -> 11964.76s]  I can't feed him anymore.
[11965.48s -> 11974.07s]  This is just going to have to do for now.
[11974.63s -> 11979.11s]  Can I eat these?
[11983.10s -> 11984.46s]  I can feed the dog more.
[11991.98s -> 11993.18s]  Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[11994.78s -> 11995.82s]  No, you can't.
[11995.90s -> 11997.98s]  Oh my god, I'm gonna get caught for stealing this
[11997.98s -> 11999.10s]  because I just put it on the ground.
[11999.10s -> 12000.30s]  All right, I'm not gonna...
[12000.30s -> 12002.06s]  I know what's going on.
[12002.06s -> 12003.50s]  I know what's going on.
[12010.46s -> 12012.70s]  There is a cool down period when you eat.
[12014.84s -> 12041.69s]  So I just need to sit around.
[12042.81s -> 12044.97s]  I need to find a place to sleep or hang out
[12045.69s -> 12048.95s]  because I can't really go anywhere until this hunger thing wears off.
[12049.51s -> 12063.78s]  Yeah, I have to abandon the bread because I can't pick it up.
[12063.78s -> 12066.90s]  If I pick it up, this guy is going to see me do that and I stole it.
[12066.90s -> 12081.50s]  You don't need to sleep now, it's for recovery.
[12081.50s -> 12083.74s]  So that doesn't make hunger go up faster if you sleep.
[12083.74s -> 12084.78s]  Like it doesn't make it go up.
[12085.42s -> 12091.86s]  All right, I'm going to tell you just forget about all these jobs.
[12091.86s -> 12092.98s]  You need to hang out somewhere.
[12093.93s -> 12095.61s]  Just like go sit over here and relax.
[12096.50s -> 12099.22s]  I'm going to go out and I'm going to mine a few more times
[12099.22s -> 12100.02s]  and I'm going to bring them.
[12100.02s -> 12101.70s]  I'm going to just you hang out over here.
[12102.26s -> 12103.58s]  Just you stay.
[12107.37s -> 12109.69s]  I'm going to go and I'm going to take care of this.
[12110.49s -> 12113.45s]  Just throw the...
[12113.45s -> 12114.25s]  This thing's huge.
[12114.25s -> 12114.81s]  I don't want it.
[12115.37s -> 12117.13s]  I need room for fucking mining things.
[12118.57s -> 12119.29s]  Back to the mines.
[12119.29s -> 12119.69s]  Let's go.
[12120.41s -> 12129.58s]  He's going to starve?
[12129.58s -> 12130.06s]  No, he's not.
[12132.14s -> 12133.34s]  There was a mine right out here.
[12138.60s -> 12139.40s]  It was like right...
[12139.40s -> 12139.88s]  Where was it?
[12139.88s -> 12140.20s]  Out here?
[12143.56s -> 12144.36s]  Like the back door?
[12144.36s -> 12144.76s]  Side door?
[12144.76s -> 12146.36s]  Where was that mining thing?
[12147.08s -> 12151.45s]  There might be another vein just sitting over here somewhere.
[12154.14s -> 12155.18s]  Why do I walk so slowly?
[12155.18s -> 12156.94s]  Because I'm building up my strength right now.
[12159.75s -> 12161.03s]  The heavier shit that I wear.
[12163.35s -> 12166.54s]  So if I go over here, let's see strength.
[12167.18s -> 12169.00s]  Is that 17 right now?
[12169.56s -> 12171.56s]  It's because I keep wearing this heavy ass armor.
[12172.20s -> 12180.78s]  So let me take a look and see where that vein is.
[12182.65s -> 12184.89s]  There is the other side.
[12184.89s -> 12185.85s]  Wasn't it like down here?
[12186.49s -> 12191.29s]  Where was that vein?
[12192.49s -> 12202.07s]  On the side?
[12208.49s -> 12209.21s]  What the hell is this?
[12210.17s -> 12211.64s]  That's like where he is.
[12211.64s -> 12211.96s]  Okay.
[12213.64s -> 12216.49s]  I wish I could pull the camera out a little bit further.
[12217.21s -> 12219.91s]  Because it's kind of hard to see anything.
[12221.77s -> 12222.49s]  See how like the...
[12222.49s -> 12223.61s]  See what's happening here?
[12223.61s -> 12224.41s]  Just like...
[12224.41s -> 12226.57s]  The camera's like freaking out every time I get to like a divot.
[12228.01s -> 12228.33s]  All right.
[12228.97s -> 12238.33s]  I can't go any further.
[12238.33s -> 12239.21s]  Was it down here?
[12239.93s -> 12245.08s]  I think it was down here, right?
[12246.04s -> 12256.39s]  I hope that I'm...
[12256.39s -> 12257.43s]  I hope I'm clicking on this.
[12258.15s -> 12265.74s]  I'm not sure if I'm actually clicking here.
[12266.30s -> 12268.20s]  Or if I'm getting blocked by the...
[12269.32s -> 12271.00s]  No, it looks like I am.
[12271.00s -> 12271.48s]  Yeah, I got it.
[12271.48s -> 12271.72s]  Okay.
[12276.09s -> 12277.62s]  All right.
[12277.62s -> 12280.66s]  I need to mine at that vein that's down here somewhere.
[12284.30s -> 12289.59s]  The hell is it?
[12289.59s -> 12294.28s]  I feel like it was right here.
[12294.84s -> 12296.17s]  Maybe a little further back?
[12296.81s -> 12298.86s]  There it is.
[12299.42s -> 12299.74s]  All right.
[12299.74s -> 12300.62s]  Just let me mine here.
[12301.34s -> 12310.60s]  So give information on the richness of resources.
[12310.60s -> 12311.16s]  Prospect.
[12314.47s -> 12316.39s]  Zone arm of a green environment.
[12316.39s -> 12316.87s]  Wait, what?
[12317.99s -> 12323.08s]  Resources of water, iron, fertility, copper.
[12323.64s -> 12324.68s]  So this is just...
[12324.68s -> 12326.04s]  That's what prospecting does.
[12326.04s -> 12326.60s]  Just shows it.
[12326.60s -> 12326.84s]  Okay.
[12330.18s -> 12331.38s]  I'll get over there and mine it.
[12331.94s -> 12335.42s]  How's the dog doing?
[12336.14s -> 12336.86s]  Oh, god damn it.
[12336.86s -> 12337.58s]  The dog needs to eat.
[12338.62s -> 12341.82s]  What if I run the dog over the bread while I just sit here and do this?
[12343.24s -> 12344.76s]  I drop the bread right here.
[12344.76s -> 12345.16s]  Ready?
[12345.72s -> 12347.30s]  Is he gonna get mad about this?
[12347.30s -> 12347.86s]  I'm just a...
[12347.86s -> 12348.74s]  I'm a fucking dog.
[12360.47s -> 12361.43s]  It's right in front of you.
[12361.43s -> 12361.91s]  Just eat it.
[12367.58s -> 12368.62s]  Dogs don't eat bread.
[12369.26s -> 12374.86s]  Give me this.
[12380.22s -> 12381.34s]  I'm filling my whole bag.
[12387.14s -> 12388.74s]  Dogs absolutely eat bread.
[12389.69s -> 12390.17s]  Don't worry.
[12390.17s -> 12393.29s]  I'm gonna buy a bunch of those beef jerkeys and we're gonna eat like kings.
[12396.50s -> 12397.54s]  Throw away the cactus.
[12401.30s -> 12402.74s]  That sells for a lot.
[12402.74s -> 12404.50s]  This thing's stupid.
[12412.41s -> 12412.97s]  You think I'm kidding?
[12412.97s -> 12413.77s]  I'm filling my whole bag.
[12414.41s -> 12418.01s]  I'll be back.
[12418.01s -> 12418.33s]  Don't worry.
[12418.33s -> 12418.81s]  He's gonna be fine.
[12428.17s -> 12428.89s]  Mining music?
[12430.42s -> 12431.38s]  Uh, fine.
[12431.38s -> 12432.50s]  I'll put on some mining music.
[12483.66s -> 12484.30s]  I'm coming.
[12485.74s -> 12486.78s]  I'll get you your food.
[12486.78s -> 12487.26s]  I'm coming.
[12487.98s -> 12496.82s]  Come on.
[12496.82s -> 12498.90s]  Just get a few more pieces of iron.
[12500.74s -> 12503.06s]  Just get a few more pieces of iron.
[12503.06s -> 12524.79s]  All right.
[12524.79s -> 12531.96s]  That's good.
[12531.96s -> 12532.68s]  All right.
[12532.68s -> 12533.16s]  Fuck off.
[12533.16s -> 12533.56s]  Let's go.
[12538.68s -> 12539.24s]  Go.
[12539.24s -> 12539.82s]  Hurry.
[12556.82s -> 12559.62s]  When I was doing this, somebody said you are so not funny.
[12560.66s -> 12564.02s]  That wasn't even my call.
[12564.02s -> 12564.66s]  That was...
[12564.66s -> 12565.86s]  People told me to do that.
[12565.86s -> 12567.38s]  That wasn't even my joke.
[12567.38s -> 12568.90s]  That wasn't even my call.
[12568.90s -> 12586.92s]  All right.
[12586.92s -> 12587.80s]  Get in there.
[12587.80s -> 12591.61s]  This should be enough for me to buy a bunch of food and then...
[12591.61s -> 12598.90s]  I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do then.
[12598.90s -> 12599.70s]  Dog.
[12599.70s -> 12603.38s]  It's all right.
[12603.38s -> 12614.07s]  This dog has passed out and woken up like 30 times.
[12614.07s -> 12615.43s]  Maybe 50 times.
[12615.43s -> 12618.26s]  How far away am I?
[12619.13s -> 12619.77s]  Hurry up.
[12623.85s -> 12624.65s]  Get in.
[12624.65s -> 12625.05s]  Get in.
[12625.05s -> 12625.45s]  Get in.
[12625.45s -> 12625.93s]  Get in.
[12625.93s -> 12626.33s]  All right.
[12626.33s -> 12626.57s]  Bar.
[12626.57s -> 12626.89s]  There it is.
[12626.89s -> 12627.13s]  Okay.
[12627.13s -> 12627.37s]  Quickly.
[12627.37s -> 12636.47s]  Come on.
[12636.47s -> 12646.81s]  Buy a shitload of those meat sticks.
[12646.81s -> 12647.61s]  Talk to.
[12647.61s -> 12648.09s]  Trade.
[12648.65s -> 12649.61s]  Show me what you got.
[12649.61s -> 12658.18s]  I got these rocks and I would like to buy from you dried meat.
[12661.80s -> 12669.88s]  And that's it.
[12669.88s -> 12671.16s]  That's all I can afford.
[12671.16s -> 12672.70s]  All right.
[12672.70s -> 12672.94s]  Dog.
[12672.94s -> 12673.74s]  Come on.
[12673.74s -> 12683.51s]  Where are you?
[12683.51s -> 12684.18s]  All right.
[12684.18s -> 12684.98s]  I need a reunion here.
[12684.98s -> 12685.62s]  Come on.
[12685.62s -> 12691.82s]  Come on.
[12691.82s -> 12693.18s]  Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[12693.18s -> 12695.82s]  I made it.
[12695.82s -> 12700.02s]  Okay.
[12700.02s -> 12701.26s]  Trade.
[12701.26s -> 12703.10s]  Here.
[12703.10s -> 12703.42s]  No.
[12703.42s -> 12704.14s]  Never mind.
[12704.14s -> 12713.18s]  Just gotta wait till you wake back up.
[12713.18s -> 12713.82s]  Eat that food.
[12735.61s -> 12739.38s]  Got it.
[12739.38s -> 12741.58s]  Okay.
[12741.58s -> 12742.46s]  Now, I'm gonna...
[12742.46s -> 12745.50s]  I'm gonna leave you with a piece of meat here.
[12745.50s -> 12748.76s]  So when you get hungry again, you eat that.
[12748.76s -> 12750.92s]  But I have to go back over there and I need to mine...
[12751.72s -> 12753.72s]  I need to mine again.
[12753.72s -> 12761.08s]  So you eat that when you're ready.
[12761.08s -> 12763.80s]  You just hang out there and eat that when you're ready.
[12763.80s -> 12767.48s]  Let me save.
[12768.12s -> 12775.22s]  This is just gonna be the rest of the stream.
[12775.22s -> 12776.66s]  But this is what you have to do.
[12777.22s -> 12778.26s]  It's about survival.
[12778.90s -> 12788.57s]  Where...
[12788.57s -> 12791.13s]  I just keep forgetting where the fuck I was going before.
[12791.85s -> 12793.21s]  All these rocks.
[12793.77s -> 12796.38s]  Where's the prospect?
[12797.18s -> 12800.14s]  Stone.
[12800.86s -> 12801.98s]  No, there is none.
[12801.98s -> 12802.62s]  Is there...
[12802.62s -> 12803.66s]  Is there none over there again?
[12804.54s -> 12809.90s]  There's so much more to the game.
[12809.90s -> 12810.22s]  There's more...
[12810.22s -> 12810.70s]  Oh, I know.
[12815.24s -> 12817.24s]  But you can't just go see it all.
[12817.24s -> 12821.72s]  You need to start from a piece of crap that can't even afford to bite dried meat leaves.
[12827.38s -> 12828.50s]  You can build your own cities.
[12829.14s -> 12831.24s]  Yeah, that's fucking awesome.
[12838.01s -> 12840.97s]  All right.
[12840.97s -> 12847.59s]  So while he's relaxing, I really do need to figure out where the hell I was gonna go.
[12848.47s -> 12851.27s]  Because I can't just run out into the wilderness again.
[12851.99s -> 12853.82s]  Let's go down here.
[12857.16s -> 12858.12s]  What is this?
[12858.12s -> 12859.00s]  Is there something over there?
[12866.36s -> 12867.08s]  Are you winning?
[12868.44s -> 12868.92s]  Not yet.
[12871.90s -> 12872.70s]  Strength is at...
[12873.50s -> 12874.31s]  Let's find out.
[12874.95s -> 12876.87s]  Strength is at 18.
[12886.78s -> 12887.42s]  Keep going.
[12888.06s -> 12888.94s]  Back down here.
[12889.90s -> 12891.70s]  Dog is still eating.
[12892.66s -> 12901.96s]  I don't know if mining is the best, most lucrative way to get money for your sick dog.
[12902.76s -> 12904.12s]  Well, it's the only thing I got right now.
[12904.84s -> 12917.05s]  Let's do it.
[12918.33s -> 12919.69s]  Now I can fill in my backpack.
[12928.18s -> 12929.78s]  Man and dog is secret hard mode.
[12929.78s -> 12931.94s]  You have to feed two mouths right away.
[12932.58s -> 12935.00s]  I didn't even think about it like that.
[12937.16s -> 12937.72s]  That's true.
[12937.72s -> 12938.60s]  I didn't even think about that.
[12939.24s -> 12947.75s]  Put on the mining music.
[12948.55s -> 12961.29s]  No, somebody didn't like that, so I'm not doing it.
[12961.29s -> 12962.65s]  One guy, yeah.
[12962.65s -> 12978.22s]  How much is in this vein?
[12978.22s -> 12982.92s]  I mean, condition...
[12982.92s -> 12984.52s]  The building is in good condition.
[12984.52s -> 12985.80s]  Iron quality, 100.
[12986.36s -> 12989.37s]  Can I have up to three workers here?
[12989.93s -> 12993.74s]  Efficiency, max efficiency.
[12994.30s -> 12999.10s]  I'm going to be iron rich.
[12999.10s -> 13009.62s]  Just build your shack next to the ore.
[13009.62s -> 13010.98s]  That's a pretty great idea.
[13010.98s -> 13022.70s]  Can I build my house right here?
[13022.70s -> 13024.46s]  Is the point of the game to be boring?
[13028.62s -> 13032.50s]  I don't think this is particularly boring.
[13032.50s -> 13039.80s]  I think the point of the game is you kind of have to very painfully start from zero.
[13054.06s -> 13055.66s]  You got to earn your place at the top.
[13057.05s -> 13060.20s]  By having your dog...
[13060.20s -> 13061.48s]  Did you eat the food that was here?
[13061.48s -> 13062.12s]  What happened to the food?
[13062.12s -> 13065.54s]  Did you already eat it?
[13065.54s -> 13067.38s]  What happened to the food that I put down here?
[13067.38s -> 13079.13s]  Did somebody take it?
[13079.13s -> 13083.02s]  Someone stole the food.
[13083.02s -> 13105.75s]  Well, I'll be back in a minute.
[13105.75s -> 13108.71s]  Why would you expect the game to have the dog auto eat the food?
[13108.71s -> 13109.11s]  I don't know.
[13109.11s -> 13110.87s]  I figured he would smell it and it would be in front of him.
[13122.33s -> 13123.45s]  I'm just going to get a few more.
[13124.18s -> 13126.89s]  Because I don't want to do this again.
[13126.89s -> 13131.40s]  I want to continue my journey going to where I wanted to go.
[13133.13s -> 13133.37s]  Hold on.
[13133.37s -> 13134.01s]  I can boot this.
[13134.57s -> 13139.96s]  I think that's full stack.
[13139.96s -> 13141.46s]  I can't even do a full stack.
[13147.96s -> 13149.56s]  It's like starving again.
[13149.56s -> 13150.68s]  I'm doing just fine.
[13161.05s -> 13162.33s]  Get a backpack before going.
[13162.33s -> 13163.05s]  Yeah, that's what I'll do.
[13163.61s -> 13165.94s]  I'm going to buy a few more pieces of jerky.
[13165.94s -> 13166.34s]  Give the...
[13166.34s -> 13167.62s]  The dog needs to eat again.
[13169.10s -> 13170.78s]  This really is just the...
[13170.78s -> 13171.90s]  The dog is becoming...
[13172.70s -> 13173.26s]  What is this?
[13177.61s -> 13178.73s]  Only two more and we're done.
[13182.87s -> 13184.55s]  The dog is draining you.
[13185.27s -> 13188.79s]  Look at the amount of work that I have to do to keep this dog around.
[13189.43s -> 13193.21s]  See how hard I work?
[13193.85s -> 13194.81s]  I don't want to lose him.
[13199.91s -> 13200.95s]  Abandon the dog.
[13200.95s -> 13202.39s]  I can't abandon the dog.
[13202.39s -> 13204.39s]  It's going to eat all my beef jerky but it's going to be...
[13204.39s -> 13204.87s]  Whatever.
[13213.86s -> 13214.98s]  I can't make the dog work.
[13214.98s -> 13216.50s]  The dog doesn't have any skills.
[13217.14s -> 13218.22s]  All right, let's go.
[13223.90s -> 13224.38s]  Get up there.
[13224.94s -> 13227.61s]  He actually did eat the food.
[13227.61s -> 13228.73s]  I'm at times three speed.
[13232.07s -> 13233.99s]  Let's go get it up there.
[13234.87s -> 13240.81s]  Make the dog have a job.
[13241.85s -> 13244.66s]  I'm not sure it's possible.
[13245.54s -> 13247.40s]  Hurry.
[13247.96s -> 13254.55s]  He's starting to pause the game while idling.
[13255.19s -> 13255.99s]  PogChamp.
[13260.46s -> 13261.18s]  Strike check.
[13261.18s -> 13261.82s]  Let's take a look.
[13263.99s -> 13264.63s]  19.
[13269.99s -> 13271.99s]  Look how terrible everything else is.
[13271.99s -> 13273.11s]  How do I get toughness?
[13275.30s -> 13275.78s]  I don't know.
[13284.54s -> 13285.82s]  26 and laboring.
[13287.48s -> 13289.40s]  I have to get beat up for toughness.
[13290.20s -> 13293.43s]  So people have to kick the shit out of me for me to...
[13293.43s -> 13293.67s]  Okay.
[13294.63s -> 13295.99s]  This should give me enough food.
[13296.87s -> 13299.98s]  This is going to be like one, two, three, four, five, six.
[13299.98s -> 13300.86s]  This should be about...
[13300.86s -> 13301.26s]  All right.
[13301.26s -> 13302.06s]  How much is a backpack?
[13318.58s -> 13321.22s]  Alt F4 from this awful MMO.
[13322.34s -> 13323.22s]  No, that's...
[13323.22s -> 13324.50s]  You got the wrong idea.
[13324.50s -> 13324.74s]  Look.
[13325.88s -> 13330.92s]  Just because I'm mining ore to feed my starving dog that's passing out every 30 seconds.
[13331.48s -> 13331.72s]  No.
[13332.36s -> 13333.00s]  There's not...
[13333.00s -> 13333.40s]  There's like...
[13334.36s -> 13335.88s]  Just wait till I build my own city.
[13336.44s -> 13338.68s]  Didn't you see the back of the box?
[13339.32s -> 13342.70s]  Where am I going?
[13342.70s -> 13343.58s]  I'm going the wrong way.
[13344.30s -> 13352.22s]  All right.
[13352.22s -> 13352.94s]  Buy more food.
[13352.94s -> 13353.82s]  Actually, I don't...
[13353.82s -> 13354.46s]  Yeah, I do.
[13354.46s -> 13355.02s]  Do I have any...
[13355.74s -> 13356.62s]  I've been eating it.
[13357.18s -> 13359.54s]  So food.
[13360.18s -> 13362.90s]  Get on in.
[13363.46s -> 13370.57s]  Let's do business.
[13371.21s -> 13372.33s]  All right.
[13372.33s -> 13375.29s]  I'm going to get 97 for these.
[13376.25s -> 13379.66s]  All right.
[13379.66s -> 13380.14s]  Give me.
[13380.86s -> 13382.06s]  So this is dried meat.
[13382.70s -> 13385.93s]  Is there anything else cheaper here?
[13385.93s -> 13387.85s]  Am I about to buy up the whole entire place?
[13391.34s -> 13392.06s]  737.
[13392.06s -> 13392.94s]  I need a backpack.
[13393.50s -> 13394.38s]  Full backpack.
[13394.94s -> 13399.75s]  I can't afford that one.
[13399.75s -> 13410.07s]  I'm going to buy up every bar of their fucking slim gems.
[13410.79s -> 13412.04s]  All right.
[13412.04s -> 13412.52s]  Come here, you.
[13413.88s -> 13414.36s]  Come with me.
[13415.00s -> 13430.89s]  Unconscious of 20 seconds and then eat that.
[13431.53s -> 13435.93s]  All right.
[13435.93s -> 13436.73s]  Ate the dried meat.
[13436.73s -> 13436.97s]  Good.
[13437.77s -> 13438.57s]  Now relax.
[13439.21s -> 13439.69s]  I keep...
[13439.69s -> 13441.69s]  I'm just treading water with this dog.
[13449.98s -> 13450.54s]  Okay.
[13450.54s -> 13452.81s]  Let's go to the other bar.
[13452.81s -> 13463.32s]  Do you have a backpack I can buy that's cheaper?
[13466.06s -> 13466.86s]  Sleeping bag.
[13467.58s -> 13470.07s]  You got like dried meat.
[13470.07s -> 13470.55s]  Should I just...
[13473.94s -> 13474.82s]  I don't know.
[13474.82s -> 13475.06s]  Okay.
[13475.06s -> 13479.18s]  Should I just buy a bunch more meat and then...
[13480.30s -> 13483.74s]  Or should I get a backpack?
[13483.74s -> 13489.03s]  There's a cheap backpack right here.
[13494.22s -> 13495.90s]  Sell pants and armor.
[13495.90s -> 13497.18s]  Buy traders backpack.
[13497.99s -> 13498.39s]  I did it.
[13498.39s -> 13498.63s]  All right.
[13498.63s -> 13499.03s]  I did it.
[13499.03s -> 13500.47s]  Somebody said to do it and I did it.
[13500.47s -> 13508.79s]  I need the money.
[13511.80s -> 13513.80s]  I desperately need this money.
[13513.80s -> 13521.08s]  All right.
[13521.08s -> 13523.67s]  So I stole that shit anyways.
[13523.67s -> 13524.95s]  I can steal it again.
[13524.95s -> 13531.51s]  So I can get a sleeping bag, a scavenger's basket,
[13533.10s -> 13537.26s]  a cheap and useful backpack commonly associated with peasants and scavengers.
[13537.90s -> 13538.78s]  Get it.
[13538.78s -> 13542.15s]  You didn't need to sell the pants.
[13542.87s -> 13546.90s]  I'm going to buy some more meat.
[13546.90s -> 13556.81s]  Okay.
[13557.37s -> 13559.69s]  I'm going to save some money.
[13566.38s -> 13567.74s]  Don't sell the chest piece.
[13567.74s -> 13569.82s]  Well, I can't.
[13569.82s -> 13570.22s]  I did it.
[13570.78s -> 13571.74s]  I bought the shitty one.
[13571.74s -> 13572.54s]  Well, that's...
[13573.74s -> 13575.10s]  What's wrong with the shitty one?
[13575.10s -> 13576.06s]  It still works.
[13576.06s -> 13576.94s]  You put stuff in it.
[13584.71s -> 13585.03s]  All right.
[13586.55s -> 13589.27s]  It's actually a drum on my back.
[13589.91s -> 13593.64s]  I just turned into a different character.
[13597.22s -> 13601.90s]  Look at this.
[13601.90s -> 13603.66s]  We're just getting started with this game.
[13603.66s -> 13604.22s]  You see this?
[13605.48s -> 13605.80s]  Look.
[13607.40s -> 13608.92s]  Are you looking?
[13608.92s -> 13609.56s]  Are you looking?
[13610.28s -> 13619.91s]  All right.
[13619.91s -> 13620.23s]  Let's go.
[13621.69s -> 13622.01s]  Dog.
[13622.01s -> 13623.13s]  I'm going to carry the dog.
[13623.93s -> 13627.45s]  You can stack in backpacks.
[13628.01s -> 13637.32s]  Let's go to the adventure shop.
[13637.88s -> 13642.92s]  I'm going to take a mechanic.
[13643.56s -> 13644.28s]  Let's go over here.
[13644.92s -> 13647.05s]  What's this?
[13647.61s -> 13648.17s]  Armorer.
[13649.67s -> 13649.99s]  Here.
[13650.71s -> 13654.01s]  You can stack in the trader's backpack.
[13655.18s -> 13656.94s]  Well, that's not the trader's backpack.
[13657.50s -> 13661.37s]  Are you looking at this?
[13673.77s -> 13678.47s]  Medium backpack.
[13678.47s -> 13680.23s]  Glorious holy map.
[13680.23s -> 13681.11s]  Small backpack.
[13686.70s -> 13692.78s]  Do you have any no trader backpacks?
[13692.78s -> 13693.26s]  That's fine.
[13693.26s -> 13695.50s]  I'm okay with my drum.
[13695.50s -> 13696.46s]  Cheap, useful backpack.
[13696.46s -> 13697.90s]  I'm just getting started.
[13697.90s -> 13698.86s]  I've just started the game.
[13699.42s -> 13701.05s]  All right.
[13701.05s -> 13702.57s]  What about standard first aid kits?
[13703.59s -> 13705.19s]  I have a basic first aid kit.
[13705.83s -> 13706.79s]  Do you sell basics?
[13707.43s -> 13708.23s]  Who ate that?
[13708.23s -> 13709.35s]  Did she just eat that out of my...
[13710.15s -> 13711.11s]  Who just ate that?
[13711.75s -> 13712.31s]  Somebody did.
[13712.31s -> 13712.63s]  I did.
[13714.98s -> 13715.22s]  Okay.
[13715.22s -> 13717.06s]  I'm going to say let's get some basic first aid kits.
[13720.20s -> 13721.72s]  What's happening right now?
[13721.72s -> 13723.08s]  Did the dog just eat?
[13727.11s -> 13728.23s]  Give the dog a backpack.
[13733.45s -> 13734.25s]  Small backpack.
[13734.25s -> 13735.05s]  I don't have enough money.
[13737.21s -> 13738.09s]  I need first aid.
[13738.09s -> 13739.29s]  I got to keep myself.
[13739.29s -> 13739.61s]  Okay.
[13742.17s -> 13743.13s]  Doggy backpack.
[13743.13s -> 13744.17s]  I can't afford it.
[13751.05s -> 13752.25s]  I have a 21% chance.
[13752.81s -> 13756.02s]  Why is there a bird inside of this building?
[13758.12s -> 13759.16s]  No, I can't do it.
[13759.80s -> 13780.95s]  I'm not selling the dog.
[13784.04s -> 13784.76s]  The bird.
[13785.32s -> 13786.33s]  What's in here?
[13803.90s -> 13805.02s]  Oh, come on.
[13805.02s -> 13812.98s]  Is there nothing in here?
[13812.98s -> 13814.52s]  Oh, fuck.
[13815.08s -> 13818.58s]  You give me...
[13818.58s -> 13819.22s]  What happened?
[13819.22s -> 13819.86s]  What?
[13819.86s -> 13825.56s]  Did that just burp?
[13837.03s -> 13839.11s]  I let out like a huge belt.
[13844.90s -> 13850.06s]  33%.
[13850.06s -> 13851.72s]  Come on, that's a third.
[13851.72s -> 13853.32s]  If I gave you a $100 bill and said,
[13853.64s -> 13856.12s]  there's a 33% chance that that's going to turn into $300.
[13857.16s -> 13860.44s]  But there's also a 66% chance that it's going to go to zero.
[13860.44s -> 13861.48s]  You're going to take that bet.
[13862.60s -> 13863.48s]  You are.
[13863.48s -> 13875.74s]  What is up here?
[13875.74s -> 13877.02s]  Look at all this stuff.
[13877.02s -> 13880.66s]  There's so many machines in here.
[13880.66s -> 13881.14s]  Gears.
[13884.39s -> 13887.64s]  What?
[13887.64s -> 13890.68s]  800 cents to skeletal repair the dog.
[13890.68s -> 13920.12s]  I need all the food I can get.
[13920.12s -> 13921.08s]  All right, let's go.
[13921.08s -> 13924.07s]  The dog's out of food.
[13924.63s -> 13926.58s]  Am I already actually out of food?
[13926.58s -> 13927.70s]  No, I got lots.
[13927.70s -> 13928.26s]  I got plenty.
[13928.90s -> 13931.91s]  Dog can be just fine.
[13932.55s -> 13935.11s]  I'm going to take a stroll.
[13935.11s -> 13936.71s]  I don't need to sneak anymore.
[13936.71s -> 13943.75s]  Very stealthy with a drum on your back.
[13945.78s -> 13946.26s]  I'm fine.
[13947.08s -> 13947.40s]  Okay.
[13948.68s -> 13951.16s]  Now, I got to pee.
[13951.16s -> 13953.24s]  It's been like four hours that I haven't peed once.
[13953.24s -> 13953.88s]  I'm going to piss.
[13954.44s -> 13955.16s]  I'll be right back.
[13955.88s -> 13961.56s]  We will continue the mission to survive.
[13961.56s -> 13962.92s]  That's the only thing we're trying to do.
[13963.56s -> 13964.60s]  I'll be right back.
[13964.60s -> 13965.94s]  See you in two seconds.
[13966.50s -> 14109.35s]  Ow!
[14109.35s -> 14116.17s]  Is he still a slave?
[14116.17s -> 14119.61s]  No, I changed because it was too hard.
[14119.61s -> 14124.07s]  It was like it was at the extreme of you start as nothing.
[14124.07s -> 14127.19s]  Maybe one day.
[14127.19s -> 14128.79s]  That'd be fun for me to do.
[14128.79s -> 14136.57s]  That's good.
[14136.57s -> 14138.57s]  Okay, I like this game.
[14141.18s -> 14149.58s]  Whoa, that's $100 from Flimflam.
[14152.42s -> 14155.19s]  Thank you, Flimflam, for the 100 bucks.
[14155.19s -> 14156.15s]  Aw, snap.
[14156.15s -> 14157.67s]  Is that a streamer that I hear?
[14161.38s -> 14162.74s]  It is.
[14162.74s -> 14163.06s]  It is.
[14163.06s -> 14164.98s]  Thank you so much for the $100.
[14167.88s -> 14169.32s]  That's five or six pizzas?
[14169.32s -> 14171.72s]  Well, no, that's five or six like double, triple deals
[14172.28s -> 14175.22s]  from Pizza Hut or Domino's or something.
[14175.78s -> 14177.78s]  It's like 20 bucks for two or three large pizzas.
[14178.42s -> 14180.60s]  That's pretty great.
[14186.49s -> 14188.63s]  But thank you so much.
[14189.45s -> 14190.25s]  That's a lot of money.
[14190.81s -> 14194.76s]  What was I doing?
[14195.32s -> 14197.77s]  But it is a streamer.
[14198.49s -> 14200.25s]  Or I don't know.
[14200.25s -> 14202.81s]  Just kind of a guy right here.
[14202.81s -> 14203.85s]  You found a blueprint.
[14204.57s -> 14206.49s]  Blueprints allow you to learn tech instantly.
[14206.49s -> 14208.01s]  To learn a blueprint, open your inventory
[14208.01s -> 14209.21s]  and right click it to learn it.
[14209.93s -> 14212.54s]  If you're wearing a backpack, make sure to close it first
[14212.54s -> 14214.38s]  so that the blueprint doesn't switch between your inventory
[14214.38s -> 14215.26s]  and your backpack, okay?
[14216.71s -> 14217.21s]  What?
[14219.67s -> 14220.31s]  Chew sticks.
[14220.95s -> 14227.11s]  I can learn how to chew on sticks.
[14227.75s -> 14232.66s]  Cool it with the slurping.
[14234.14s -> 14235.74s]  I know people like hate that shit up.
[14235.74s -> 14239.02s]  So I think just do it because it sounds fun to me.
[14239.02s -> 14246.54s]  What's the dog doing?
[14246.54s -> 14248.25s]  Almost okay.
[14252.94s -> 14253.66s]  Stop slurping.
[14253.66s -> 14254.22s]  It's rude.
[14255.56s -> 14258.36s]  Well, you know, there are some cultures
[14258.92s -> 14262.68s]  where slurping is actually a sign of happiness
[14262.68s -> 14265.48s]  and being well taken care of,
[14265.48s -> 14266.68s]  especially if you have like a restaurant.
[14266.68s -> 14269.08s]  It's actually seen as a sign of respect.
[14280.65s -> 14281.29s]  That's soup.
[14285.59s -> 14286.07s]  What?
[14286.07s -> 14287.91s]  No, I just know that information.
[14289.30s -> 14292.50s]  Well, I'm not saying that I'm going to do it.
[14293.46s -> 14294.34s]  Look, can I just carry?
[14296.12s -> 14298.04s]  I know that's true because I do what?
[14299.27s -> 14315.08s]  I'm not just making it up.
[14315.08s -> 14316.36s]  Noodles equals soup.
[14326.47s -> 14327.99s]  Where am I going to take my fucking dog?
[14330.02s -> 14331.14s]  Why am I still carrying the dog?
[14331.14s -> 14333.14s]  Because I want the dog to be able to rest
[14333.14s -> 14336.82s]  because the dog is currently starving and unconscious.
[14338.49s -> 14339.93s]  So I'm trying to do my best.
[14341.61s -> 14342.89s]  I'm not supposed to be idling like that.
[14342.89s -> 14343.39s]  All right.
[14344.62s -> 14345.26s]  Open up the map.
[14346.33s -> 14347.77s]  Continue with what I was going to do.
[14347.77s -> 14353.58s]  Remember this town exists because I'm going to keep...
[14353.58s -> 14354.46s]  I want to go to the river.
[14355.54s -> 14356.02s]  All right.
[14356.02s -> 14358.50s]  On the way to the river, I got some food.
[14359.30s -> 14367.38s]  The dog has just been suffering this whole time.
[14368.98s -> 14369.38s]  It's okay.
[14369.38s -> 14370.82s]  I got a box full of food.
[14373.13s -> 14377.69s]  I have a big college laundry bag full of snacks to eat.
[14381.13s -> 14384.65s]  So he can just rest on my shoulder and eat out of the bag.
[14391.14s -> 14392.10s]  Let's move.
[14392.10s -> 14395.45s]  I think I just break his neck.
[14396.34s -> 14396.74s]  Let's just...
[14396.74s -> 14397.46s]  Okay, hold on.
[14398.26s -> 14404.55s]  I thought I just went too fast and snapped his neck.
[14405.19s -> 14405.99s]  Holy shit.
[14406.55s -> 14407.03s]  All right.
[14410.55s -> 14412.47s]  I am no longer hungry.
[14415.13s -> 14416.97s]  Let's go back to running.
[14420.71s -> 14421.11s]  Okay.
[14422.54s -> 14424.30s]  Dog is still on cooldown.
[14424.94s -> 14430.47s]  Can I do anything else?
[14431.03s -> 14432.71s]  Anybody else that wants to trade?
[14432.71s -> 14436.87s]  Do I have any other people who want to join my cause here of surviving?
[14439.70s -> 14441.70s]  I don't think so, but I'm ready to go out into the wilderness.
[14441.70s -> 14442.66s]  He'll heal eventually.
[14442.66s -> 14444.02s]  I'm going to keep him up here hanging out.
[14444.90s -> 14445.70s]  Let's go to the river.
[14446.34s -> 14457.61s]  We got to save.
[14457.61s -> 14458.57s]  Auto-save is right here.
[14474.74s -> 14476.10s]  The backpack is bigger than me.
[14477.32s -> 14478.68s]  Yes, it kind of is.
[14479.32s -> 14483.58s]  Now, I'm starting to learn the ropes a little.
[14483.58s -> 14483.98s]  I'm this...
[14483.98s -> 14484.54s]  I'm...
[14484.54s -> 14485.10s]  This is going to...
[14485.10s -> 14485.82s]  I'm enjoying this.
[14486.46s -> 14496.81s]  I feel like this is the kind of game that you could just dunk 500 hours in.
[14497.45s -> 14509.05s]  Yeah, you put a lot of time into this game.
[14510.71s -> 14511.67s]  Can you train the dog?
[14512.31s -> 14512.95s]  I have no idea.
[14513.83s -> 14517.99s]  But the dog is just barely now able to not be unconscious.
[14518.71s -> 14525.22s]  Is the game worth it?
[14529.69s -> 14532.71s]  That depends on what you want out of it, you know?
[14533.43s -> 14534.47s]  Because take a look, right?
[14535.19s -> 14537.03s]  If you just want to walk around and...
[14537.75s -> 14539.51s]  There are no rules to the game.
[14539.51s -> 14540.63s]  It says it on the back of the box.
[14542.84s -> 14547.50s]  If you just want to play a game where your character sucks
[14548.14s -> 14552.89s]  and you can walk around anywhere on the map and there are no rules,
[14555.96s -> 14556.44s]  then sure.
[14557.16s -> 14558.97s]  Some people probably say,
[14558.97s -> 14559.85s]  I don't want to do that.
[14559.85s -> 14560.89s]  That sounds kind of boring.
[14560.89s -> 14564.89s]  And I don't want to just be like a useless idiot the whole game.
[14565.53s -> 14569.54s]  Well, I mean, then this game is not for you.
[14569.54s -> 14577.43s]  Would a fan of Fallout like this game?
[14578.15s -> 14579.70s]  The original?
[14579.70s -> 14580.74s]  Like Fallout 1 and 2?
[14580.74s -> 14581.14s]  Probably.
[14593.11s -> 14595.19s]  I would say that would make some sense.
[14600.33s -> 14602.09s]  Playing an NPC in a big world.
[14602.09s -> 14603.45s]  Yeah, that kind of is what this is.
[14605.37s -> 14605.93s]  How's the dog?
[14606.65s -> 14607.29s]  Doing all right.
[14607.93s -> 14612.02s]  It's like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld.
[14612.02s -> 14612.52s]  Yeah.
[14613.38s -> 14615.62s]  Because you can build cities.
[14615.62s -> 14617.14s]  You don't have to do anything.
[14618.89s -> 14620.81s]  You can walk around with an unconscious dog
[14620.81s -> 14622.89s]  and look for weird shit to stare at.
[14622.89s -> 14624.49s]  Or you can build a city.
[14626.97s -> 14628.09s]  It's kind of just up to you.
[14628.73s -> 14633.53s]  You could go searching for demons in the northwest.
[14633.53s -> 14640.07s]  Well, you're now turned into a rug of a dog somehow.
[14640.79s -> 14643.83s]  Which is terrible.
[14644.47s -> 14648.92s]  Because look at them.
[14654.42s -> 14655.14s]  Breed the dog.
[14663.72s -> 14665.16s]  Let's take a second here.
[14665.80s -> 14667.02s]  All right, who just ate?
[14667.02s -> 14667.66s]  105.
[14668.30s -> 14669.34s]  How much more food do I have?
[14671.10s -> 14671.66s]  Not enough.
[14671.66s -> 14673.74s]  But it's probably enough to get to the next area.
[14675.91s -> 14677.67s]  You could be a slave for two hours, yeah?
[14678.31s -> 14680.90s]  That's exactly what happened to the very forgetting.
[14684.66s -> 14686.18s]  That character didn't even have an arm.
[14686.82s -> 14688.63s]  So it was even harder.
[14688.63s -> 14691.21s]  All right, let me prospect here.
[14691.21s -> 14694.10s]  What do we got?
[14694.10s -> 14694.60s]  Stone.
[14698.50s -> 14699.00s]  Hmm.
[14702.60s -> 14703.10s]  Stone.
[14703.72s -> 14706.14s]  You guys see any stone?
[14709.53s -> 14710.17s]  Water.
[14710.17s -> 14710.67s]  Stone.
[14713.72s -> 14719.42s]  Hmm.
[14719.42s -> 14721.34s]  I mean, there's stones all around me,
[14721.34s -> 14723.66s]  but I don't know if it's worth stopping for.
[14731.48s -> 14735.61s]  Well, all right, we're going all the way up this discovered holy farm.
[14736.25s -> 14739.74s]  Can you fall off?
[14740.46s -> 14743.35s]  I should probably be really careful here.
[14744.07s -> 14749.00s]  Where am I now?
[14749.56s -> 14751.93s]  I'm up on the mountain.
[14758.71s -> 14760.55s]  Put on a chill OST.
[14760.55s -> 14761.19s]  All right, fine.
[14761.83s -> 14763.58s]  That sounds like a good idea.
[14763.58s -> 14768.33s]  How about, uh, what's a good, like, chill?
[14769.67s -> 14770.31s]  Not doom.
[14779.29s -> 14780.01s]  Earthbound?
[14781.40s -> 14782.92s]  Earthbound OST doesn't sound bad.
[14790.94s -> 14791.44s]  What?
[14791.58s -> 14792.30s]  That was not me.
[14792.30s -> 14792.78s]  I didn't do that.
[14792.78s -> 14793.58s]  That was the soundtrack.
[14793.58s -> 14795.10s]  That was the earthbound soundtrack.
[14795.10s -> 14805.93s]  All right, this looks good.
[14806.49s -> 14810.57s]  What do you mean sure?
[14810.57s -> 14811.13s]  Look, listen.
[14813.99s -> 14814.71s]  See?
[14814.71s -> 14818.41s]  Different things that I'm doing that.
[14818.41s -> 14827.53s]  I think I just crashed my browser by doing that too.
[14827.53s -> 14828.81s]  Oh, what the fuck am I doing?
[14829.45s -> 14833.05s]  Hey, there we go.
[14833.05s -> 14833.55s]  Let's go.
[14841.99s -> 14851.58s]  How you doing, dog?
[14860.06s -> 14880.65s]  Is this earthbound or is this toe jamming, Earl?
[14880.65s -> 14881.37s]  Nowhere.
[14881.37s -> 14885.85s]  Holy shit.
[14885.85s -> 14886.33s]  Where am I?
[14886.33s -> 14887.05s]  Where do I go?
[14887.05s -> 14888.41s]  I don't have much food.
[14888.41s -> 14889.98s]  I only have like three.
[14889.98s -> 14891.26s]  Oh, no, two.
[14891.26s -> 14894.28s]  And the dog's not even ready.
[14894.28s -> 14896.89s]  Oh, what's this?
[14896.89s -> 14905.64s]  Materials?
[14905.64s -> 14906.92s]  What can I do with this?
[14906.92s -> 14916.38s]  I don't think I can do anything with this.
[14916.38s -> 14918.22s]  I don't think I have the necessary tool for this.
[14918.22s -> 14925.82s]  No, nothing here.
[14927.53s -> 14929.69s]  Dog's not ready to walk on his own.
[14933.98s -> 14935.74s]  Oh, got to camp.
[14935.74s -> 14939.88s]  That will take me to Wizard, Wizard.
[14939.88s -> 14942.36s]  It was the river.
[14948.09s -> 14948.81s]  Let's head that way.
[14950.41s -> 14951.13s]  Kill the dog.
[14954.71s -> 14956.15s]  I can't just kill the dog.
[14957.21s -> 14959.69s]  You understand the last three hours or no,
[14959.69s -> 14960.97s]  probably like two hours of this game,
[14961.53s -> 14963.62s]  has been making sure this dog stays alive.
[14970.41s -> 14972.25s]  Let the dog go on a spy mission to camp.
[14972.25s -> 14973.85s]  The dog can't even walk.
[14976.46s -> 14980.78s]  So, that's not going to happen.
[14980.78s -> 14988.98s]  That's a long way down.
[14989.62s -> 14993.35s]  I'm going to get jumped over here or something, aren't I?
[14995.62s -> 14996.18s]  What?
[14996.18s -> 14998.25s]  What the hell was that?
[14998.89s -> 15000.62s]  That was weird.
[15000.62s -> 15001.12s]  Okay.
[15004.62s -> 15005.58s]  Some more materials.
[15006.46s -> 15010.79s]  He can walk now, but I don't want him to.
[15010.79s -> 15013.37s]  I want him to get to at least halfway.
[15013.37s -> 15014.33s]  I don't want him to use energy.
[15015.21s -> 15016.97s]  Let me use the energy for him.
[15016.97s -> 15023.03s]  Okay, a few more things to look at up here.
[15025.86s -> 15026.50s]  Prospect.
[15035.08s -> 15035.56s]  Never mind.
[15037.98s -> 15038.86s]  Ooh, what's that?
[15044.76s -> 15045.56s]  Something over here.
[15046.12s -> 15051.75s]  I wish I could just throw him in the basket.
[15053.08s -> 15054.20s]  No, I kind of do too.
[15062.01s -> 15063.29s]  How am I going to get down here?
[15063.29s -> 15065.29s]  I went up so far all the way to the top.
[15066.33s -> 15067.69s]  Why did I go on the mountain?
[15067.69s -> 15068.81s]  I'm not even ready for this.
[15074.82s -> 15077.06s]  I have to drop the dog to interact with things.
[15077.06s -> 15077.70s]  Oh god.
[15078.58s -> 15084.55s]  You're going to be okay?
[15097.08s -> 15098.04s]  Are you all right?
[15098.04s -> 15099.66s]  How come you're not walking with me?
[15102.90s -> 15103.30s]  With me.
[15103.30s -> 15103.70s]  Come on.
[15103.70s -> 15104.10s]  Let's go.
[15104.66s -> 15115.26s]  No, this is material.
[15115.26s -> 15117.54s]  Is it copper?
[15120.28s -> 15120.60s]  Copper.
[15121.16s -> 15127.59s]  The dog passed out again.
[15127.59s -> 15127.99s]  No.
[15127.99s -> 15129.11s]  Why are you not staying with me?
[15137.46s -> 15138.26s]  Get me a copper.
[15142.22s -> 15143.42s]  We consider any...
[15146.07s -> 15146.63s]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[15146.63s -> 15148.23s]  It doesn't have the job anymore, right?
[15148.23s -> 15151.27s]  I need to do a sign.
[15152.47s -> 15152.87s]  Follow.
[15158.12s -> 15158.52s]  Jobs.
[15167.70s -> 15168.50s]  Answer the door.
[15169.14s -> 15169.99s]  What door?
[15171.42s -> 15171.66s]  Okay.
[15177.02s -> 15177.66s]  Okay, good.
[15178.30s -> 15186.89s]  I actually remember this part of the game.
[15186.89s -> 15189.45s]  It scared the shit out of me when I first played it.
[15189.45s -> 15195.14s]  This copper is shitty quality.
[15196.34s -> 15197.22s]  The other one was too.
[15197.94s -> 15202.28s]  I don't have enough food to mine here.
[15204.33s -> 15205.05s]  Oh, fuck.
[15205.69s -> 15208.57s]  The dog ate the last piece of bread.
[15208.57s -> 15210.02s]  Or whatever the hell it was.
[15210.02s -> 15210.98s]  I gotta get out of here, you're right.
[15210.98s -> 15211.46s]  I gotta go.
[15213.19s -> 15214.47s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[15215.11s -> 15216.15s]  I guess I'll get one.
[15216.15s -> 15216.31s]  Go.
[15219.78s -> 15221.62s]  There's gotta be the kind of town here.
[15221.62s -> 15222.26s]  There has to be.
[15223.06s -> 15226.22s]  Come on.
[15226.86s -> 15232.34s]  Go, go, go, go.
[15233.14s -> 15235.88s]  All right.
[15235.88s -> 15236.28s]  We're out.
[15240.74s -> 15243.85s]  Take a town or something.
[15244.65s -> 15248.15s]  I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere.
[15248.87s -> 15250.92s]  I'm in the middle of nowhere.
[15251.80s -> 15260.54s]  The dog is so slow.
[15262.20s -> 15262.60s]  All right.
[15262.60s -> 15263.64s]  Pick up the dog again.
[15263.88s -> 15264.68s]  I'm sorry.
[15264.68s -> 15265.48s]  I gotta pick you up.
[15267.72s -> 15268.52s]  I gotta run.
[15268.52s -> 15270.04s]  Look at how much faster I am than you.
[15270.04s -> 15270.44s]  Let's go.
[15271.16s -> 15277.27s]  I'm not stopping for anything.
[15278.42s -> 15280.82s]  I just gotta make it down the other side of the mountain.
[15283.69s -> 15284.57s]  Is this early access?
[15284.57s -> 15284.81s]  Nope.
[15285.88s -> 15287.08s]  Game is out.
[15287.08s -> 15287.80s]  It has released.
[15288.36s -> 15293.10s]  This is a released video game.
[15300.46s -> 15302.84s]  Can I even get down from here?
[15303.48s -> 15306.28s]  Yep, I can.
[15306.28s -> 15306.68s]  Right here.
[15310.04s -> 15312.52s]  Down, around, and then come on.
[15312.52s -> 15313.48s]  Is this a house over here?
[15315.75s -> 15316.15s]  Something.
[15316.15s -> 15316.63s]  A house.
[15316.63s -> 15317.11s]  A hut.
[15317.11s -> 15317.67s]  A village.
[15318.87s -> 15319.75s]  A small group.
[15320.31s -> 15328.25s]  When did it get released?
[15328.25s -> 15329.13s]  10 years ago.
[15331.85s -> 15332.57s]  I don't think so.
[15333.13s -> 15337.53s]  Okay.
[15337.53s -> 15338.65s]  Dog's hungry again.
[15339.45s -> 15340.25s]  Although so am I.
[15341.05s -> 15343.42s]  Let's go.
[15343.42s -> 15343.98s]  Pick up pace.
[15344.78s -> 15357.75s]  We didn't even scratch the surface of this area, too.
[15358.55s -> 15361.29s]  It's been in development for 10 years.
[15363.61s -> 15363.85s]  Wow.
[15370.44s -> 15372.12s]  That's a passion project, for sure.
[15377.43s -> 15378.55s]  There was a camp over here.
[15382.34s -> 15383.46s]  Give me some points of interest.
[15383.46s -> 15384.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[15384.18s -> 15384.66s]  Who are you?
[15385.54s -> 15387.21s]  Holy servants.
[15387.21s -> 15387.85s]  Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[15387.85s -> 15388.49s]  Maybe they'll help me.
[15389.05s -> 15394.57s]  Do you guys have anything?
[15394.57s -> 15395.37s]  You need rations?
[15396.09s -> 15397.72s]  I got a sick dog.
[15400.73s -> 15401.93s]  Anybody here I can talk to?
[15402.57s -> 15410.23s]  No, I'm going the wrong way.
[15410.23s -> 15410.95s]  I gotta go this way.
[15411.51s -> 15414.07s]  Past the river.
[15419.93s -> 15420.41s]  But okay.
[15421.54s -> 15422.26s]  I got...
[15422.26s -> 15423.46s]  I'm not starving.
[15423.46s -> 15424.42s]  I'm normal.
[15424.42s -> 15431.91s]  Supplies and stuff I can't stop for.
[15432.55s -> 15436.42s]  I was gonna make it to the other side of the river and I'll be fine.
[15443.88s -> 15444.92s]  No discoveries.
[15445.48s -> 15447.98s]  The hat...
[15447.98s -> 15448.70s]  Look at the...
[15448.70s -> 15449.58s]  What could be right here?
[15449.58s -> 15450.46s]  There has to be some...
[15450.46s -> 15451.26s]  Wend, okay?
[15452.14s -> 15454.17s]  The city of Wend.
[15454.73s -> 15469.18s]  Where's the dog?
[15469.74s -> 15476.15s]  Did I lose the dog?
[15485.90s -> 15486.38s]  Bounty.
[15487.72s -> 15487.96s]  What?
[15491.80s -> 15492.28s]  Knife.
[15492.28s -> 15493.00s]  Skeletons.
[15494.49s -> 15494.97s]  Heart.
[15494.97s -> 15495.61s]  Skeletons.
[15503.53s -> 15504.25s]  Uh...
[15504.25s -> 15507.51s]  I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[15508.47s -> 15511.94s]  I know the music is clashing.
[15512.82s -> 15523.24s]  I'm in good spirits and I do have a weapon.
[15523.24s -> 15523.88s]  So I'm not...
[15524.44s -> 15525.16s]  I'm not afraid.
[15531.70s -> 15532.42s]  Something up here.
[15533.30s -> 15536.28s]  We're just gonna go right into the crater.
[15537.08s -> 15550.68s]  You wanna play Mongolian throat singing?
[15550.68s -> 15554.55s]  No, we got earthbound on right now.
[15554.55s -> 15555.75s]  I love this OST.
[15555.75s -> 15556.39s]  O-S-T.
[15560.36s -> 15561.24s]  This is soundtrack.
[15562.12s -> 15569.24s]  Is there a town?
[15569.24s -> 15569.56s]  Camp?
[15571.14s -> 15572.34s]  Discovered holy farm.

[25582.04s -> 25588.65s]  of turned into this i'm probably going to change this by the way well i fucked it up
[25589.69s -> 25595.02s]  uh so that by the way in case you're wondering germa expensive is going to
[25595.02s -> 25609.67s]  become a base emote and it's going to be changed into a germa one guy that fits more as one guy
[25609.67s -> 25622.65s]  than it does as expensive in my opinion so that'll be that's going to become a base emote and
[25622.65s -> 25629.58s]  then i don't know what i'm going to do for the 20 the 25 sub is just like it's that's
[25629.58s -> 25640.66s]  a that's so much i'll put like i'm gonna put like an x there which one guy told you to do
[25640.66s -> 25646.18s]  that um it might even been in the discord maybe this maybe one guy said it in the discord that
[25646.18s -> 25656.17s]  it would be like good i don't know i'm sure one guy told me to do that don't worry hey duke duke
[25656.17s -> 25661.93s]  what's going on thanks for the ten dollars uh not gone yet and what the hell was i watching
[25661.93s -> 25669.37s]  germa just show auto and you'll get thousands of bits no i don't i don't need to that's
[25669.37s -> 25673.29s]  all right you guys know autos around he's he actually was behind me the whole time
[25674.09s -> 25680.34s]  sleeping in a little bed that i made for him but uh you were watching kenshi
[25682.02s -> 25689.70s]  it is a pretty wild game but one that i currently think is fun to do uh thank you so much duke i'm
[25689.70s -> 25697.38s]  not sure when you leave but good luck when you do i'm not sure what the date you're leaving
[25702.58s -> 25711.83s]  the link i sent broke well that's not good show us the dog no he's eating but thank you

[25723.91s -> 25730.79s]  incredibly kind of you smelly but we demand the dog vessel no i he's down there he's get
[25730.79s -> 25735.99s]  there's a piece of meat in front of him when he gets up from no now that's like a bad
[25735.99s -> 25739.67s]  never mind because i was that implies that he's like down there lying down
[25740.23s -> 25744.23s]  no because i was making a reference to the stream dog i told you i didn't want that
[25744.23s -> 25749.72s]  dog to be auto i don't want that dog connected to auto at all so that's not what's going to
[25749.72s -> 25758.71s]  happen the auto is doing just fine downstairs eating his dinner dog food thank you smelly
[25758.71s -> 25763.99s]  boy for the one dollar even given uh ever given thought to playing any of those combat strategy
[25763.99s -> 25773.37s]  games like total war sieve nice try or mountain blade uh would be fun to watch you try those
[25773.37s -> 25787.77s]  um not really not really mountain blade is something that's requested a lot total war
[25787.77s -> 25792.33s]  seems cool because you have 10 000 units on the screen at the same time might be fun to make a
[25792.33s -> 25801.61s]  custom map or something no those are not for germa those are not nice try he tried he wrote
[25802.33s -> 25810.71s]  of word here and he thought i was going to stumble over and just say it almost you need
[25810.71s -> 25815.27s]  fast paced games for this boomer what about the game we've played to the one that i was
[25815.27s -> 25821.06s]  just on tonight that's a fast paced game people were screaming at me when i was mining
[25826.84s -> 25832.36s]  i was trying to slow it down and everybody in chat is like excuse me sir would you please step
[25832.36s -> 25849.22s]  on the gas and hold it down until you touch the floor no i i look listen this this game
[25849.22s -> 25853.22s]  i know has like a lot of people that are big fans and that probably spent a lot of time in
[25853.22s -> 25861.42s]  it and it's fucking awesome because it seems like a great game i i get it i understand
[25862.22s -> 25870.97s]  but i need to like mine the dumb ore to make enough money to buy the dog food
[25871.77s -> 25882.49s]  you know what i'm saying but thank you smelly boy thank you keldos for the one dollar italics
[25882.49s -> 25902.42s]  did a great job with the effects hashtag charity oh yeah it's fucking i loved it so if
[25902.42s -> 25909.24s]  you're curious about that um i loaded up a shitload of sound effects and music files
[25911.14s -> 25916.82s]  and they were just on a button press and i'm like hey dude you have full just creative control
[25917.70s -> 25922.10s]  he's like you're gonna give me full creative he's like i have full creative control i'm like dude
[25922.10s -> 25929.24s]  yeah do whatever the fuck you want except obviously like the the voice changer was there
[25929.24s -> 25934.50s]  for bugleberry i mean both like voice changer as in like you know that's his real voice
[25936.70s -> 25945.46s]  what software is it it's a stream deck yeah the placement on a lot of those sound clips
[25945.94s -> 25953.08s]  fucking perfect explain that clip what's wrong with this one
[25962.33s -> 25966.41s]  i mean it's a voice changer so i'm sorry he pressed a button that was called like distortion
[25966.41s -> 25974.57s]  effect i would if you look closely we look at my mouth i say i say hey and for some reason
[25974.57s -> 25977.93s]  he pressed the button at the right exact time to distort it and added like a monster effect
[25977.93s -> 25993.10s]  to it i would hey yeah so i mean that's the explanation for that but if you remember
[25993.10s -> 26000.41s]  what the first time bugleberry was on stream that i didn't have a like stream deck i was
[26000.41s -> 26004.89s]  opening up random tabs to have scream noises and stuff so it was so much more seamless
[26004.89s -> 26010.17s]  for him just to have a fully loaded board with sound effects for him just to do it
[26010.17s -> 26017.91s]  whenever he wanted to so no i i watched that stream back and i had a lot of fun it was kind
[26017.91s -> 26025.53s]  of hectic though because we had to build up and take down essentially a random bunch of stuff
[26025.53s -> 26033.13s]  that we put in the way and we had to be out out at the lock out of the studio no ifs
[26033.13s -> 26040.01s]  ands or buts we had to be out at 9 p.m so there was no oh can we like stay no we had
[26040.01s -> 26045.46s]  to clean up and shit so if you're wondering why that stream had to be kind of done after three
[26045.46s -> 26056.12s]  hours is because of that boomer watches his own streams well i wanted to make i wanted to make
[26056.12s -> 26068.09s]  sure it went all right i mean that was you know it was kind of an ordeal how long did
[26068.09s -> 26077.03s]  it take to clean uh we cleaned up real real quick it took about three or four straight
[26077.11s -> 26082.55s]  hours to put it all up and then it took about when you get locked in just disassemble put
[26082.55s -> 26087.99s]  everything in boxes get it out it's probably like an hour and a half maybe hour right when
[26087.99s -> 26094.46s]  the stream turned off we got going but i'm glad people thought it was fun i had a lot of fun
[26095.94s -> 26100.10s]  i have a lot of uh because i wanted to see the chat too you know i didn't get to see
[26100.10s -> 26105.10s]  the chat for the most of the entire stream and it's fun to kind of go back and see what
[26105.10s -> 26108.14s]  you know i wanted to see what you guys are saying i think it's fun you guys are saying
[26108.14s -> 26118.54s]  some funny shit so but that's uh that's that uh thank you soup said again for the 50 dollars

[26166.28s -> 26179.06s]  bad about dabbing god i don't i don't feel bad about dabbing because i never did it
[26181.38s -> 26185.22s]  stop dodging the question what my favorite thing to press is off stream uh i got a nice
[26185.22s -> 26193.26s]  mug my mother sent me these great gold foil playing cards because oh you moved to vegas
[26193.26s -> 26197.50s]  here let's go and they're really really nice really cool really sentimental kind of thing
[26197.50s -> 26214.94s]  from my mother that was really nice of her and oh wait listen to this whoa here this one guys
[26215.50s -> 26221.18s]  remember when i talked about tile and i went off on like a four hour long rant about how i
[26221.18s -> 26225.66s]  hated tile so much the little beep things for your phone so you can find your keys and stuff
[26226.38s -> 26229.82s]  and i talked about how shitty they were and how it was the worst product ever because
[26229.82s -> 26233.26s]  you can't replace the battery you have to like get you have to like sign up for their
[26233.26s -> 26238.36s]  subscription program because when they die you can't replace a battery you have to like hey
[26238.36s -> 26247.74s]  give me some new ones send but i need to buy new ones now right uh um they have batteries
[26247.74s -> 26258.07s]  now tile now has batteries that you can replace i wonder who got that to happen
[26267.29s -> 26274.41s]  now i had like i probably had fucking nothing to do with it but uh tile now has a battery of
[26274.41s -> 26289.80s]  a replaceable battery so i got new tile for christmas you were the only person to ever
[26289.80s -> 26299.24s]  complain about that i i know right imagine if i was that much of like a fucking eagle maniac
[26299.96s -> 26313.66s]  that i really thought that that was why there are 60 billion people in america and like one
[26313.66s -> 26328.14s]  person that just has like you know a few thousand people hanging out no what if the president of
[26328.14s -> 26334.17s]  tile tweeted at you i'd be like um that your products are great they're really like i just
[26334.17s -> 26339.61s]  like flew off the handle one night because like i might i lost my keys and i couldn't find them
[26339.61s -> 26344.17s]  and the tile was dead and they say they have a one year oh up to one it's a one year
[26344.17s -> 26350.30s]  lifespan it was like six and a half months it was just bullshit two of the tiles that
[26350.38s -> 26355.58s]  me and kim both bought them and i think two of them would just gone dead after like seven months
[26356.54s -> 26369.05s]  and the other two lasted for a year but i digress i got new ones let's see i get i am
[26369.05s -> 26380.74s]  not gonna look i'm gonna hold my judgment i will amend my statement 750 of the world's
[26380.74s -> 26390.63s]  population is in america yeah there's four billion people in alaska there's i think i
[26390.63s -> 26400.94s]  think there's like 11 billion people in la 25 billion people in new york city and then because
[26400.94s -> 26405.18s]  like the you know that the heartland of america like the big there's only like 60 000 people

[26583.74s -> 26587.98s]  that whole this that was there was like six or seven dark souls 2 streams but i thought
[26587.98s -> 26597.14s]  that was like such a funny moment when i like rolled off the edge but thank you hydra for
[26597.14s -> 26600.34s]  the one dollar thank you i am monk for the one dollar they say hi hashtag charity thank you

[26628.57s -> 26639.06s]  ppps haha you said the it's the the board the letter comes after oh twice but that's okay
[26639.70s -> 26650.54s]  favorite stream of the year very too many um i don't i can't tell you i have too many streams
[26650.54s -> 26657.58s]  this year that i really really was like holy shit that i had a lot of fun i can't really
[26657.58s -> 26661.80s]  single any out what's the worst streams of the year i could probably tell you um
[26662.60s -> 26674.70s]  so what even what's the worst stream of the year don't sit labo no labo would be like in
[26674.70s -> 26693.74s]  the top five for me sorry uh this one carazam was not even this year the second hotline miami
[26693.74s -> 26708.95s]  2 stream no i it stressed us all out too much but that's the point of that game
[26709.51s -> 26712.47s]  the bird house would that would be i liked that stream i had a lot of fun
[26714.09s -> 26731.96s]  bird house was pretty bad what was wrong with the bird house bird house was easily the worst
[26732.76s -> 26745.11s]  yeah but that was too recent what about okay but besides the bird house
[26751.86s -> 26756.42s]  vampire was the worst stream yeah but was that because that was the worst stream or was because
[26756.42s -> 26768.34s]  that was like the worst game you know do am i at fault for that when a game is not that
[26768.34s -> 26785.82s]  great yes game okay all right all right i'm gonna have to tell you game review portable
[26786.54s -> 26794.66s]  uh dalek says i don't know if i agree with you the game review portable stream was i mean
[26794.66s -> 26809.40s]  awful but i liked it everyone forgot about immortal unchanged because it was so bad
[26810.20s -> 26821.67s]  i'll give you game review portable though because like that was so the whole i couldn't
[26821.67s -> 26827.26s]  get it captured yeah i'll say game review portable is probably the worst stream i did
[26827.26s -> 26834.23s]  all year i own it in a technical sense just like technically speaking that was probably
[26834.23s -> 26849.58s]  the worst stream i've ever done i thought that's true i liked that stream that's why i'm not sure
[26849.58s -> 26857.43s]  i agree with the game review portable pick here for worst stream of the year the minecraft stream
[26857.43s -> 26861.61s]  was bad yeah but does it count well it does it count if i was drunk you know what i mean
[26862.84s -> 26867.24s]  like if i'm like drunk and gonna play a game like does that count as like that was like a
[26867.24s -> 26876.47s]  10 minute drunk guy joke because that doesn't count as a stream that doesn't count you can't
[26876.47s -> 26881.67s]  okay you can't take a portion of one stream where like drunk guy plays minecraft for 20
[26881.67s -> 26894.25s]  minutes that's naughty that's that's a portion of a bigger stream the labo streams were
[26894.25s -> 26916.98s]  torture local streams stays drunk to excuse bad streams i've been drunk on stream like
[26916.98s -> 26936.34s]  four times ever in three years come on that's bullshit what like drunk on stream
[26938.41s -> 26947.45s]  that i what you did three labo streams that got drunk during all of them no what are you talking
