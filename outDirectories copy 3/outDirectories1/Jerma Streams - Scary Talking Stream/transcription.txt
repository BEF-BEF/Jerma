[1.21s -> 9.43s]  Hi guys. Throw, throw, throw, get the rocks out of here. No rocks today. It's supposed to be a
[9.43s -> 15.91s]  chill out, hang out, the veg out stream. That means when you like eat a shitload of vegetables,
[15.91s -> 22.58s]  right? When you're a bodybuilder. You don't understand. The reason why it took me like
[22.58s -> 30.26s]  20 minutes or so, I got carrots, I've got tomatoes, I've got fresh, some fresh garden roots,
[30.26s -> 41.32s]  all sitting right here. And my coffee's still too hot to drink. I hate when that happens.
[41.32s -> 50.70s]  When am I going to do a cooking stream? That you'll maybe. But today we're going to do something
[50.70s -> 67.85s]  a little different today. Hang out and have a little fun. We're going to just play plain. Okay.
[68.74s -> 77.66s]  We're going to. Yeah, that's a nice scripted joke. Because I've been doing some more intense video
[77.66s -> 83.94s]  games for the last three or four screens besides Viscera, but that was intense too. Not today.
[85.00s -> 93.46s]  We're just going to sit here like this. I'm sorry. Like this. Hi. Welcome to an in real life stream
[93.46s -> 98.71s]  where I sit here and drink coffee and we talk about topics. You know what I mean? I'm not going to
[98.71s -> 106.49s]  shave. I'm not doing it. You know, what, what, what topic are we going to talk about today?
[106.49s -> 118.25s]  I think we're going to talk about what's the current state of magical wizard board. What's the
[118.25s -> 130.20s]  current state of that game? Does it even still fucking exist? I got this free mouse pad in 2012
[130.20s -> 140.82s]  and I've, I've never not used another mouse pad. I'm also a little tired today. Your audio sounds
[140.82s -> 155.38s]  bad. Wait, we've got some fun things to try today in our IRL stream. Now that I pulled that out,
[155.38s -> 161.86s]  I just fucked up my whole desk though. Kenshi won the poll. I'm probably going to play Kenshi.
[161.86s -> 168.55s]  We need to start. I need to just relax for a little bit. Okay. Just chill out. Why do I have
[168.55s -> 175.08s]  villain hair? Because I just do. I have to accept it at some point that I'm just, I'm a fucking bad
[175.08s -> 181.43s]  guy, right? You can't be a good guy with this kind of hair drinking out of this kind of cup.
[181.43s -> 192.50s]  Like this, this is a bad, this is a bad guy sitting here. Uh, anyways, uh, give me one second.
[192.50s -> 197.13s]  I wanted to try something today because I have this thing. I know the audio doesn't sound very
[197.13s -> 201.69s]  good, but that's for very specific reasons because the voice changer is currently as you can see,
[201.69s -> 209.24s]  turning the fuck off. No, uh, I have a bunch of different presets here that probably sound a little
[209.24s -> 218.07s]  fucking strange. I want to do this a bit. This is a bit coming up. Just if you're serious.
[221.78s -> 227.03s]  The thing is, I don't know what this sounds like. Oh, it sounds like this. That sounds fucking
[227.03s -> 246.07s]  horrible. Ow! What is this one? Hello? I don't know what this is supposed to be for. This is
[246.07s -> 254.10s]  called romantic Paris. I think this is just background noise. Yeah. I don't think that does
[254.10s -> 262.17s]  anything. Uh, but yeah, welcome. How many, how many, how many, do I have chat in the right place?
[262.17s -> 271.86s]  No, chat's in the wrong place today. I forgot. Dude, just do a date. Can I have two going at
[271.86s -> 282.47s]  once? No, we're not doing a fucking virtual date. I want to do a singing stream where I put, I was
[282.47s -> 290.18s]  going to get an elaborate costume. I didn't have any time though. And turn on this and sing and
[290.18s -> 296.68s]  like put like, like fuck up the video for a little bit and pretend like this is a real singing stream
[296.68s -> 308.54s]  and have people come in and yell at me that I have a like auto tune on. What is sword? Sword. I,
[308.54s -> 313.19s]  oh, it's because it's, it's because it's going like round round round. I get it. I get it.
[313.19s -> 326.31s]  The lightsaber sound. But is it really though? This is called zombie. Zombie. Same with this song.
[326.31s -> 349.32s]  This is not even the rap. You're layering. Let me tell you guys something. This is this kind of stream
[349.32s -> 356.90s]  where we talk about topics and I mean like Jesus. What's going on in the industry right now?
[356.90s -> 364.09s]  You've got blizzard is acting all crazy. What the heck is that? What the heck is going on here?
[369.86s -> 376.76s]  I literally can't understand a single thing you're saying. Should I speak, should I speak, uh,
[376.76s -> 395.90s]  uh, uh, it's gonna be possible. They're layered. I'm going to try to speak from the closet as the
[395.90s -> 402.38s]  monster in your closet. Like they're talking about politics. I want, I'm going to get in there and
[402.38s -> 406.78s]  be the monster in the closet and talk, like talking about politics. We're going to have scary music.
[406.78s -> 424.07s]  Hold on. Is there ambience with this one? Hold on. Let me see. What the fuck is going on? Can you
[424.07s -> 434.98s]  guys hear, can you hear me now? Does this sound normal? I, I, I, I should sound completely normal
[434.98s -> 448.25s]  now. I'm, I'm, I'm doubled. Wait. Oh, okay. Now I should sound normal. Do I sound? Here we go. Okay.
[448.25s -> 454.60s]  So if you didn't catch the thing I said, uh, uh, I want, I'm going to go in the closet there with
[454.60s -> 459.32s]  that voice on and just start talking about like fucking politics and be, and be like monster in
[459.32s -> 470.34s]  closet stream. Like sleep tight. Uh, sticks renegade just gave $50. Thank you so much sticks for the
[470.34s -> 478.86s]  50 bucks. And I just got to tell you, uh, thank you so much. Uh, you say, Hey German, remember that,
[478.86s -> 485.10s]  uh, no, I don't, I don't want that to be on. That's probably not something I should have on
[485.10s -> 489.98s]  it because this is a big fucking money donation. I don't want to like fucking mock it or anything.
[489.98s -> 494.26s]  You know what I mean? Uh, thank you for the $50 though, for real. Uh, Hey German, remember that
[494.26s -> 498.66s]  abscess surgery I had, uh, thanks to Crohn's disease. Well, I just found out the hospital
[498.74s -> 505.88s]  didn't destroy my wallet. Insurance saved me 98% of almost 10 grand. So since I'm not broke,
[505.88s -> 512.89s]  I'll give some of those savings to you for being the best content creator ever here in my heart.
[512.89s -> 519.99s]  Best content creator ever. I can't even thank you, man. Like that's, uh, I'm really,
[519.99s -> 525.40s]  really happy to hear that you didn't have to spend a shitload of money to fix something that
[525.40s -> 535.75s]  your body decided to do on its own. Thank you so much. Swift, Swift recovery. Thank you for the
[535.75s -> 544.79s]  $50 fucking dollars. The voice is crackling. It's probably because I have too much going on. Let me
[544.79s -> 554.62s]  test it out. Voice crackling, crackling, crackling. Is it? Probably have to mess with some settings,
[554.62s -> 560.07s]  but, uh, I was going to do IRL today. I'm not even paying attention to anything else that's
[560.07s -> 565.58s]  going on over here. Uh, cause I have, I forgot I did my title correct. I did, I did my hair like
[565.58s -> 572.20s]  so fast and I don't even, it doesn't even look that good and the lights are all wrong, but, um,
[572.20s -> 579.94s]  I wanted just to hang out today. Speaking of lights, I can brighten it up a little bit in here.
[579.94s -> 587.37s]  Uh, where's my mouse? Cause, I don't know, I like to do little IRL streams. Sometimes we just dick
[587.37s -> 595.26s]  around and do nothing. You know, it's fun. Sometimes you just want to do that and we'll
[595.26s -> 601.29s]  probably end up, cause I mean, I'm not going to sit here for six hours doing this. We'll probably
[601.29s -> 614.68s]  end up going to Kenshi or, uh, what's the other one? I have an uneven receding hairline. No,
[614.68s -> 621.54s]  it's, it's pretty even. It's just over here because my hair is pushed this way. So like see,
[622.26s -> 628.74s]  the other hair is like, my hair is like combed this way. So it's actually like here, but it's,
[628.74s -> 638.06s]  it just looks that way because it's combed it that way. Simpsons 100% run. Well, hold on. First
[638.06s -> 646.81s]  things first, I gotta get my goddamn, I gotta check my words with friends. Onomatopoeia,
[646.81s -> 660.30s]  that's a triple word score. Uh, I need to change the lights for one. Why do I give a shit if you
[660.30s -> 665.85s]  can see the screen or not? I don't understand. That's like not a big deal. I don't know. There's
[665.85s -> 683.50s]  nothing on here that's like that important. I'm like, wait a minute. Where is it? Try to change
[683.50s -> 687.67s]  this a little because this needs to be a little bit brighter. It's not bright enough for me.
[687.67s -> 709.02s]  I need more brightness. I don't know. I think, okay, I, I'm going to, I'll do this in chat
[709.02s -> 714.10s]  because I'm going to go in there and I'm going to hang out in there and be in chat and just
[714.10s -> 718.54s]  talk. And then I'm going to, I'm going to open the fucking door in like five minutes and there
[718.54s -> 724.12s]  are people that are just going to be, just pretend like I didn't start the stream yet.
[724.12s -> 732.39s]  Please fix the crackles. Does that fix it? Is that fixing crackles? Is it still crackling? Hey,
[732.39s -> 742.63s]  hey, hey, hey, yo, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, fixed. Okay. Good. So, uh, just give me a second.
[742.63s -> 746.23s]  Well, I'm going to, I'm going to go in the chat and just hang out for like five minutes.
[746.87s -> 759.13s]  So I'm just going to be in there. Let me just do like, yeah. All right. Just give me a second.
[760.01s -> 766.12s]  I have to go to my own stream. I forgot about that. I got like fucking weird pants on too, man.
[766.84s -> 840.22s]  All right. That's enough of that. I'm done with that. Uh, that was practice for later
[840.22s -> 846.94s]  because I'm going to draw, I'm going to make it red. Wow. That was really funny.
[847.50s -> 857.05s]  I thought in my head, it played out a little funnier. Scared of the dark. No, I was just in
[857.05s -> 863.16s]  there. I can't be scared of the dark. I'm just sitting in there. Uh, beer me, user name,
[864.65s -> 868.09s]  beer me a user name. Just gave five community subs. Thanks a lot beer.
[869.96s -> 881.02s]  He faced his fear. He can't stand chat that much. That's not true. That's completely untrue.
[883.18s -> 888.86s]  We're still crackling. What the fuck is happening? Hold on. I'm crackling. Why would it be
[888.86s -> 898.26s]  crackling? Cause I'm listening to it. Hold on. Is it crackling right now? What? Like when you hear
[898.26s -> 915.08s]  it through here, it's not right. So what the heck is going on here? It's just, it's well,
[915.08s -> 924.74s]  the voice changer is on right now. You know what I mean? It's on right now. He listened to one guy.
[926.58s -> 945.53s]  Oh, turn up the game. I unplugged something from my neck right now. I did not. I didn't know such
[945.53s -> 956.97s]  thing. Did the voice change that guy driving by? Oh shit. Still on the weird one. All right. So
[956.97s -> 994.87s]  here's what we're going to do. I want to try this. Set it up. Uh, go. I wonder how this is actually
[994.87s -> 1006.09s]  going to sound. Now let's get the, uh, this might be very embarrassing. I got to make sure the voice
[1006.09s -> 1013.18s]  changer is on and working as fucking intended. No, don't worry. We're going to do demon in the
[1013.18s -> 1020.97s]  closet. We'll get, this is going to be a lot. I was just hanging out from it. It isn't already.
[1024.50s -> 1029.06s]  We can just reverse voice change it. No, you can't. Only like three people in here know how to do
[1029.06s -> 1039.51s]  that. Do you know how to do that? You know how to do that. There's people, people in here know how
[1039.51s -> 1052.04s]  to do that. I gotta be careful then. All right. So let's say I get, let's get it ambient in here.
[1061.30s -> 1071.56s]  Oh my God. It's still crackling. Here's what I'm going to do above that. Here's what's going to
[1071.56s -> 1083.93s]  happen. Ready? Turn off. Turn this off. That sounded any better? Is it still happening?
[1086.14s -> 1087.18s]  Tell me if it's still happening.
[1090.30s -> 1093.34s]  Cause that, that's the only other outliers to why that would be happening.
[1093.34s -> 1102.63s]  Cause that I had a compressor on, maybe the compressor was like, was fucking with it.
[1107.91s -> 1115.48s]  Let's, uh, still happening. Probably a loose mic now. It's nothing to do with the mic.
[1115.48s -> 1118.20s]  It's to do with the software pulling through. But I had this running during the Christmas
[1118.20s -> 1121.72s]  stream and it wasn't a problem. So I don't understand why the fuck did like 1500 people
[1121.72s -> 1129.40s]  just show up in a second. What happened? They were like 3500 people in it. It was like five,
[1129.40s -> 1144.71s]  5,000. Did I just get braided by Dr. Phil? Nice. Got braided. Well, welcome. Hey,
[1144.71s -> 1152.78s]  welcome to the setup of the joke that's not going to pay off. Rated by Robaz. Oh,
[1153.50s -> 1158.62s]  fuck. Yeah. What's up? It's like two raids in a row or two streams in a row.
[1159.42s -> 1169.98s]  It's like two or 3000 people. Damn. Well, thank you. Welcome guys. Uh, what's that?
[1175.90s -> 1178.62s]  Oh, it's an emo. I thought like, I thought something was wrong.
[1178.70s -> 1183.58s]  One mod spam. Turn up your mic. I'm so scared about the crackles. Okay, here we go.
[1184.94s -> 1190.46s]  I gotta, I gotta hear these first. Has it been like this the whole time? Why has it been on this?
[1191.50s -> 1211.64s]  That's not what I wanted. Oh my, this whole thing. Is it crackling now during this one,
[1211.64s -> 1219.93s]  this particular? Cause that would be a pain in the ass. Yes. Fuck. I don't get it.
[1219.93s -> 1232.01s]  Let me try something here real quick. Give me a second. I'm going to reboot this whole thing.
[1232.01s -> 1238.41s]  Not the screen like this program. I'm going to mute everything. So it should not be happening now.
[1239.53s -> 1262.90s]  Are we still, are we cracking? It shouldn't be at all. No, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[1262.90s -> 1267.51s]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
[1267.51s -> 1277.33s]  right? It's because of God damn it. Okay. Hi guys. Welcome everyone to the
[1277.33s -> 1286.61s]  mic should work fucking properly because this is the mic that's actually plugged in over here.
[1287.41s -> 1292.93s]  First time singing on stream by the way. Now that that's settled, we're fine. There's no crackles.
[1294.91s -> 1303.42s]  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, V, W, X, Y, and Z, right? We're fine.
[1303.42s -> 1334.72s]  Everything sounds good. Now. Hold on. Now. How do we sound now? I just rebooted it all.
[1335.68s -> 1350.67s]  I know it's a little quiet, but is it going cracking? That's the problem. No, no cracking,
[1350.67s -> 1356.83s]  no cracking, cracking, no cracking. I know there's a, yeah, the reverb is on because it's on this
[1356.83s -> 1365.06s]  church one. All right. I'm ready. You ready? You ready for this? I need to have like a karaoke
[1365.06s -> 1380.10s]  website. Let's go to, I need to make sure I know what this sounds like. A, hello? A, A, A,
[1381.22s -> 1401.17s]  A, A, A, A. This is that, that's doing it right? Sam's voice. Is it, it's no auto-tune? This should
[1401.17s -> 1412.18s]  be auto-tune on this. Is it not auto-tune? I think it should be. I was going to go with it.
[1412.18s -> 1430.66s]  So we got auto-tune, changing our voice to sound good, right? Okay, good. Now I need a karaoke,
[1430.66s -> 1441.76s]  free karaoke website. I turned off the auto-tune because it probably sounds stupid. Hey, what's up?
[1441.76s -> 1454.35s]  It's me. So now let's go to, well, what's a good free karaoke website? Turn off the dry signal,
[1454.35s -> 1467.90s]  leave it 100% wet. Okay. Red, uh, is this, is this a real website? What's a good karaoke website?
[1467.90s -> 1490.37s]  And don't you dare. Just YouTube it. Oh yeah. All right. Okay. How about tonight's gonna be a good
[1490.37s -> 1505.22s]  night karaoke? I think that sounds pretty good. I got my auto-tune on the tonight's gonna be a
[1505.22s -> 1512.27s]  good night karaoke. They always sound so shitty too. It's always like somebody did it on a Casio
[1512.27s -> 1544.69s]  keyboard. Okay. Here we go. I can see it. You ready? I'm going to see some, here we go.
[1547.26s -> 1573.76s]  I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night, that tonight's gonna be a good night,
[1573.84s -> 1590.50s]  that tonight's gonna be a good, good night. Does that sound good? That tonight. Hello?
[1609.79s -> 1617.18s]  Come on. So this is not, uh, this is not an auto-tune. Right. That makes sense. Okay.
[1617.26s -> 1630.30s]  That's wrong. So, uh, all right. I can find the auto-tune. Hello. Hello. Hello. You can always
[1630.30s -> 1643.23s]  tell when it's an auto-tune because it sounds fine. Right. You got, I gotta go. I'm going to
[1643.23s -> 1663.58s]  rip through these octaves. Ready? This is auto-tune. It has to be. I'm ready. And in three, two, one,
[1664.78s -> 1689.06s]  let's bring it on.掌声 Come on, let's go. Clap it up. Clap it up.
[1689.06s -> 1703.07s]  Clap it up. Let's clap it up. I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night, that
[1703.07s -> 1711.39s]  tonight's gonna be a good night, that tonight's gonna be a good, good night. I got a feeling
[1711.39s -> 1717.47s]  Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[1717.47s -> 1721.62s]  Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[1721.62s -> 1725.34s]  Tonight's gonna be a good good night.
[1725.34s -> 1726.30s]  I got feeling.
[1726.30s -> 1729.60s]  Woo-hoo!
[1729.60s -> 1732.76s]  It's gonna be a good night.
[1732.76s -> 1736.40s]  That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[1736.40s -> 1739.26s]  That tonight's gonna be a good...
[1739.26s -> 1741.12s]  Oh, doesn't the song have lyrics?
[1741.12s -> 1742.82s]  I've got that feeling!
[1742.82s -> 1747.46s]  Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, no, that's it. How long does this go on for? How long?
[1748.66s -> 1754.67s]  Yeah, good night, but tonight's gonna be a good day
[1756.19s -> 1757.99s]  Tonight's the night
[1757.99s -> 1759.75s]  Let's live it up
[1759.75s -> 1761.67s]  I've got my money
[1761.67s -> 1763.59s]  Let's spend it all
[1763.59s -> 1766.67s]  Go out and smash it like oh my god
[1767.35s -> 1769.19s]  Jump off that sofa
[1769.19s -> 1771.19s]  Let's get it off. I
[1771.98s -> 1777.74s]  Know that we'll have a ball if we get down and go out and just lose it all
[1779.06s -> 1781.06s]  Way
[1782.06s -> 1784.06s]  Way
[1786.06s -> 1788.06s]  You fill up my cup
[1788.50s -> 1790.02s]  Shove it up

[2092.74s -> 2094.93s]  This thing's brand new
[2094.93s -> 2102.43s]  Hold on. I gotta like read I could have you gotta be kidding me
[2102.99s -> 2114.10s]  What broke it because I changed the white balance. That's a lot of bullshit. Oh, yeah, I don't even know this thing's plugged in
[2114.10s -> 2116.86s]  I gotta like unplug it. I might this is gonna like crash the whole stream
[2117.46s -> 2119.46s]  This is not good
[2119.46s -> 2126.90s]  What the hell what I was just getting started with like the oh
[2131.40s -> 2137.48s]  This is not good. All right, I'm gonna try to rip it out because it's no. What are you doing?
[2138.28s -> 2149.28s]  Use the mic as a webcam. What does that even mean?
[2150.02s -> 2154.34s]  Use my microphone as a webcam
[2156.89s -> 2159.35s]  What I'm so confused
[2160.19s -> 2165.94s]  Hold on. All right. Everybody say it fucking Hail Mary because I'm ripping the cord out
[2165.98s -> 2182.98s]  Let's see if it happened. We good. Am I still live? I'm good, right? I think we're good
[2183.22s -> 2204.84s]  We're good. What happened to the camera?
[2205.28s -> 2217.57s]  Am I still alive and I mean that it work land physically. It looks like a thermal camera now
[2217.93s -> 2227.62s]  This thing's broken. All right, what the fuck are we doing? Oh, yeah, I was gonna get in that closet and say a bunch of bullshit
[2234.05s -> 2242.54s]  Yeah, hello. Yeah, good. No now something's really fucked up. All right, so I got yeah
[2242.74s -> 2251.05s]  I got three monitors one two three. All right, so let's do a straw poll because I want I'm curious at what you guys think
[2256.05s -> 2275.02s]  Here you go, please vote if you haven't if you have even if you have it has not been even one one
[2275.02s -> 2277.02s]  You understand just here you go
[2277.22s -> 2280.14s]  All right. So what do you guys want me to do? What are you looking for today? No, I
[2280.78s -> 2306.02s]  Was I wanted to see how badly this was gonna lose. What is monster discussion? Well, I don't I haven't figured that out yet
[2306.34s -> 2310.25s]  Can I vote for neither? Yeah
[2310.93s -> 2312.13s]  Just go like this
[2312.13s -> 2314.88s]  Oh already really I
[2315.52s -> 2317.70s]  Didn't do anything yet
[2317.90s -> 2351.56s]  Okay. So what do you what are we looking out here? That's a fantastic cup. It was a gift. It was a gift from my girlfriend
[2351.56s -> 2356.48s]  I don't know. I noticed you got it at some store. Probably get it on
[2357.00s -> 2360.10s]  Probably get on an Amazon if I were to guess maybe
[2360.78s -> 2368.99s]  Alright, so it looks like I wanted to see how badly karaoke was gonna get destroyed and didn't really get destroyed that badly
[2368.99s -> 2370.99s]  Which is kind of a shock
[2372.38s -> 2377.06s]  that clip that clip of me got will go around and it'll be like
[2377.98s -> 2381.57s]  What an embarrassment, but I know it will
[2382.09s -> 2387.21s]  And I'm gonna be lying there in bed just with my fucking iPad looking at clips of like good night
[2387.21s -> 2389.41s]  No, I'm gonna be like, oh fuck me. What have I done myself?
[2390.61s -> 2394.06s]  alright, so let's uh, let's go ahead and
[2394.98s -> 2406.97s]  Get some scary music. I'm gonna turn the light down. I don't know why I was going that high
[2407.69s -> 2415.28s]  Okay. So here we go. I got a loop this
[2415.86s -> 2424.31s]  This is
[2424.31s -> 2431.27s]  Why my computer is fucked up. Did I like sing so poorly and with a fucking voice changer on that it broke the computer
[2431.71s -> 2441.86s]  Let's see how this one sounds. That's pretty good
[2442.30s -> 2452.52s]  Now I'm gonna drop the light a lot and then I'm gonna have a light in the closet and I don't even know if you're gonna
[2452.52s -> 2454.00s]  Be able to hear me
[2454.00s -> 2464.62s]  The last time I fucked with the light on this thing. We had a huge problem
[2465.30s -> 2485.78s]  That's fine. A little more. That looks good. That looks good. That looks weird
[2486.26s -> 2493.60s]  Like my my lips never let my lips this big and red
[2494.28s -> 2502.92s]  Holy shit. This is not sweat on my shoulders. You can't do that one to me. Don't do me like this. That's not sweat
[2502.96s -> 2505.96s]  That's a light casting. I look like
[2507.84s -> 2509.76s]  No, it's my beard I
[2509.76s -> 2513.34s]  Look pretty fucking evil. All right, you ready?
[2513.94s -> 2519.26s]  This is gonna be awful this whole don't worry that let me let me like keep doing awful shit
[2519.34s -> 2524.82s]  So you forget how awful the karaoke portion of this stream was and that wasn't even karaoke it was just a joke
[2524.82s -> 2531.58s]  But forget it. Let's keep doing terrible shit. So like well look when there's like ten terrible bits in a row
[2532.10s -> 2535.86s]  What I what was the worst one? I don't remember what he what was the first one he did
[2535.86s -> 2538.34s]  Oh, he did like the carry. Well, that was other one
[2538.34s -> 2543.46s]  That one he like fucking went outside his window and screamed. I was fucking stupid too. All right, let's go
[2559.58s -> 2561.58s]  About the good climate
[2576.23s -> 2578.39s]  Monsters are real that's the tagline for this one
[2650.22s -> 2652.22s]  Oh
[2712.82s -> 2714.82s]  Oh
[2764.54s -> 2780.52s]  Was I incomprehensible we didn't hear anything no, just give me a clip
[2781.24s -> 2783.74s]  Show it to me I
[2783.82s -> 2786.02s]  Said some fucking good shit during that
[2791.71s -> 2806.28s]  Really? Oh god. Damn it. Oh, well, we got the gist of it. All right, can I turn off like the I'm gonna go back into here
[2806.52s -> 2823.42s]  All I heard is something about monsters being real. This is so fucked up. There we go. That looks that's better
[2823.78s -> 2826.79s]  Why does turning the brightness down fuck the whole thing up?
[2827.47s -> 2835.20s]  Something about the closet being too small. Yeah
[2836.04s -> 2840.70s]  That was part of it. I
[2840.70s -> 2849.07s]  Heard the word monsters ink. Yeah, I got my photos developing back there. That's what's over there. I
[2856.81s -> 2858.97s]  Heard don't call the police
[2872.86s -> 2874.02s]  anyways
[2874.02s -> 2876.26s]  So right now here's the funny story about that
[2878.30s -> 2883.03s]  Right there right there. I mean like I mean literally right there is
[2884.11s -> 2890.61s]  Probably where Kim's head is where she's lying down right now on the other side of that closet wall
[2891.25s -> 2893.05s]  so
[2893.05s -> 2895.03s]  She's probably just like
[2895.03s -> 2904.42s]  What the fuck is going on in that room? No, like she's on the other side of the she's on the other side of the wall
[2904.42s -> 2907.46s]  She's not in there. Look, you know what's in here
[2907.46s -> 2930.43s]  Oh
[2981.33s -> 2997.39s]  Eat your ass as a necklace. No, that's not what I said. All right, so
[2998.57s -> 3002.26s]  Have I been I've been sitting here for 51 minutes
[3002.86s -> 3008.62s]  It's been I felt like it's been like three
[3031.14s -> 3040.74s]  That doesn't even sound scary that sounds that sounds like shit
[3041.26s -> 3055.88s]  German shitting himself right now. No, I'm fine. All right, so we had our fun in IRL
[3071.01s -> 3075.53s]  You can see my face I
[3079.26s -> 3081.18s]  like my like human
[3081.18s -> 3090.45s]  Like boy face is just sitting right there. Like I said, we're gonna do I'm gonna change this from sitting around
[3094.76s -> 3099.90s]  Well knock not yet. Hold on. They cancel that not quite yet
[3110.34s -> 3118.34s]  All right. We're gonna do one more thing. What the hell is it?
[3129.78s -> 3136.31s]  There's also this one too
[3147.54s -> 3152.22s]  This just this just sounds like somebody punched me right here
[3152.86s -> 3160.06s]  Sounds like I'm something stuck in my throat. This is the chad voice
[3160.70s -> 3164.80s]  Yeah, I mean might as well just finish it up today
[3166.80s -> 3181.23s]  I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm not gonna do it. Don't worry
[3183.68s -> 3195.33s]  Where's the root? Did it take me this long to find it? This is it?
[3197.62s -> 3206.05s]  This is it. I found it. This is like a hundred and fifty ones to click on here. What about this one?
[3209.90s -> 3230.28s]  Magic this is it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh god. Damn it. This actually is the one. Okay, so I mean
[3230.40s -> 3251.06s]  What's the song with like that I want to sing before we move on the rats mixtape September. Yeah, it's a good one
[3251.06s -> 3264.50s]  How's the sun? It's pretty good
[3269.17s -> 3272.21s]  It's not fixing my teeth, it's not fixing it
[3272.77s -> 3278.52s]  But don't matter I can knock this out of the park. You can redo it. Do you remember?
[3279.64s -> 3282.37s]  The 21st night of September
[3283.25s -> 3286.37s]  Love was changing the minds of pretenders
[3287.01s -> 3289.25s]  Pretender and this
[3291.03s -> 3293.27s]  It fucked up it did it wasn't even on the screen
[3293.83s -> 3299.12s]  Our hearts were ringing in the key that our souls were singing
[3299.68s -> 3302.74s]  As we danced in the night. I remember
[3303.54s -> 3306.59s]  How the stars stole the night away
[3308.59s -> 3315.35s]  Yeah, but did ya say that you remember but did ya
[3316.31s -> 3319.27s]  Dancing in September. Ah, did ya?
[3320.15s -> 3322.15s]  Never was a cloudy day
[3325.54s -> 3327.22s]  Oh, no, never mind
[3327.22s -> 3341.72s]  It's not that part over again. Bah, do do bah, do do bah, do bah, do do bah, do do bah, do
[3347.03s -> 3357.67s]  Bah, do do but oh that's I fucking hate this. I almost just clicked stop streaming. I was like hovering over and almost just clicked it
[3358.50s -> 3361.06s]  All right, so we're gonna move on
[3362.02s -> 3367.19s]  Thanks for hanging out for the irl
[3367.27s -> 3378.32s]  Uh, I don't know what I did. It was more than one to do this for like an hour. It's what we're linking
[3382.15s -> 3385.99s]  It's not fixing my teeth it's not fixing it it probably sounds all right
[3386.79s -> 3391.19s]  But don't matter I can I can knock this out of the park. You can redo it. Do you remember?
[3392.55s -> 3394.63s]  The 21st night of September
[3396.15s -> 3398.81s]  Love was changing the minds of pretenders
[3400.07s -> 3402.07s]  and this
[3402.15s -> 3406.82s]  Why is it off? I was doing this perfect. Why is it off beat?
[3407.70s -> 3414.48s]  Oh shit
[3414.48s -> 3416.48s]  Okay, it's off beat because
[3416.48s -> 3419.52s]  This takes like about 150 milliseconds to change the voice
[3420.48s -> 3421.92s]  There's a delay
[3421.92s -> 3423.92s]  on the actual voice changer
[3434.05s -> 3436.93s]  I thought you just had no rhythm. No, that's not what it is
[3439.51s -> 3442.63s]  Don't point change. Yeah, I I actually can fix that in here, but
[3443.43s -> 3445.94s]  I didn't think about that
[3445.94s -> 3449.20s]  Too busy doing another dumb shit
[3449.20s -> 3451.76s]  Prove it with video evidence
[3451.76s -> 3452.80s]  I mean
[3452.80s -> 3456.87s]  Hold on is is this coming out? Correct?
[3459.68s -> 3465.30s]  Is that synced up because I have the it's it's turned off right now. It should be like ready
[3468.68s -> 3470.68s]  So but now that it's on
[3476.63s -> 3482.90s]  The length is the same. So
[3483.60s -> 3486.00s]  It's because it doesn't matter. Hold on a second. I got an idea
[3491.40s -> 3495.40s]  Make it go 150 milliseconds. No, I can do this ready. I'm just gonna delay
[3496.52s -> 3502.84s]  The yeah, they'll just do this. It should be better. No, so you tell me did I fix it?
[3503.08s -> 3508.02s]  Oh
[3508.02s -> 3510.84s]  Love was changing the minds of pretenders
[3522.55s -> 3524.80s]  No, what
[3524.80s -> 3528.58s]  It's worse now. How is it worse?
[3531.43s -> 3532.87s]  Maybe I have to do this
[3532.87s -> 3541.24s]  How many respects is it ready?
[3549.40s -> 3551.40s]  Yeah
[3559.44s -> 3576.71s]  Whatever sorry, was that too loud? I have a limiter on the limiter doesn't work. The limiter doesn't work
[3580.82s -> 3610.10s]  All right. Thanks for watching this stream. We're gonna play against you now. Okay. Hey guys
[3610.74s -> 3613.57s]  Welcome back
[3613.57s -> 3617.51s]  Uh, wait, I peeked
[3617.51s -> 3619.99s]  Why is it mike mike's not fucking whatever. I'm sorry
[3626.24s -> 3631.04s]  Uh, what do I need the stream?
[3631.12s -> 3633.12s]  Our plane just landed
[3639.28s -> 3640.32s]  Did you
[3640.32s -> 3644.00s]  Wait, did you shit in my it? I I just changed the microphone source
[3646.39s -> 3649.27s]  I'm really i'm really actually fucking sorry like doing that
[3650.07s -> 3651.59s]  fucked up like
[3651.59s -> 3653.59s]  Made a loud noise or something. Sorry
[3653.83s -> 3655.99s]  That's not my intention at all. I promise
[3660.77s -> 3663.09s]  Now it's delayed. Well, it's because I have to do this now
[3665.52s -> 3670.60s]  All right, let's play catchy
[3670.60s -> 3672.36s]  I forgive you this time
[3672.36s -> 3675.96s]  Thank you
[3675.96s -> 3678.44s]  It's not still delayed. I could see it in real time right here
[3683.64s -> 3685.64s]  Uh, what was it called the band of?
[3687.49s -> 3689.49s]  the band of mary, uh
[3692.04s -> 3694.04s]  frog frog crew
[3698.45s -> 3703.25s]  Play geoguessr. Wait, why am I getting a huge play geoguess geoguessr geoguessr?
[3704.87s -> 3709.44s]  You want more of this shit?
[3709.44s -> 3716.36s]  What is going on in this chat right now?
[3716.44s -> 3717.88s]  Oh my god
[3717.88s -> 3732.60s]  Yeah, I mean wait. All right. Hold on. I'm gonna play kenshi for a little while because
[3733.83s -> 3735.83s]  I I planned on it anyways
[3739.91s -> 3744.63s]  So then after after kenshi maybe a few three four hours of kenshi. I'll
[3745.51s -> 3747.35s]  Pull out and we'll play some
[3747.35s -> 3749.67s]  I don't why would I I don't want to I all right, we'll see
[3751.62s -> 3753.64s]  And i'm i'm getting booed
[3753.64s -> 3755.00s]  Now i'm getting booed
[3755.00s -> 3756.20s]  It's okay
[3756.20s -> 3759.08s]  We'll just keep the fucking camera on who cares
[3759.56s -> 3764.12s]  Well, this will be it. This will be the one webcam stream every three months that you get on this stream
[3765.08s -> 3769.20s]  That's fine
[3769.20s -> 3771.20s]  And then I need to move over here
[3772.90s -> 3774.90s]  Uh, this is the frog crew, right?
[3781.91s -> 3785.51s]  You actually want to know what kenshi is. It's a great simulation
[3786.07s -> 3789.11s]  Frog simulating kind of game where you you start as a frog
[3789.83s -> 3793.35s]  and you start as a tadpole and then from tadpole you go to
[3794.23s -> 3798.47s]  Um adolescent and then from adolescent you go to frog and then from frog you go to adult frog
[3799.11s -> 3802.07s]  And you eat fish and you um
[3802.87s -> 3804.87s]  Eat flies and stuff. It's really cool
[3805.51s -> 3809.81s]  You get a dog
[3809.81s -> 3811.81s]  Now this needs to move this way
[3815.97s -> 3821.33s]  And let's open it up
[3821.33s -> 3823.33s]  Kenshi back to kenshi
[3823.97s -> 3829.27s]  I'm probably gonna mute this for a second just because it's probably gonna be pretty loud
[3829.91s -> 3836.00s]  Let's go with that
[3836.00s -> 3838.00s]  You should see it right now
