[1.66s -> 18.79s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? How you doing? I am doing good. I apologize for starting on time
[18.79s -> 27.43s]  today. I was gonna start like 20 minutes ago, but I got a text message that I had to respond to.
[28.23s -> 35.56s]  I had to talk to somebody really quickly. And what do you have it? How do you know? Here we are.
[38.30s -> 47.42s]  Well, I was texting for 20 minutes. I had to text and I had to do something
[48.86s -> 53.56s]  because of the text that I received. You understand what I'm saying here. Okay,
[54.68s -> 59.46s]  give me a second. I'm gonna play Hitman 2 tonight. I'm excited for this game because
[60.18s -> 64.10s]  the first one was my game of the year when it came out a couple years ago.
[65.06s -> 70.65s]  And I am so stoked to play this game. I'm so excited for it.
[73.80s -> 76.84s]  It's gonna be hard. Oh, sorry. It's gonna be a ton of fun.
[78.84s -> 85.34s]  As you can tell, I'm fucking excited for it. So, see you guys in a minute. Get a water.
[86.30s -> 142.81s]  Uh, another Labo stream. No, no, no. Kim and I built the, uh, Kim and I built the jet
[143.53s -> 147.69s]  with the plane and then I have the submarine that's gonna sit there for a rainy day.
[150.01s -> 160.74s]  So you might see the submarine built six months from now. You never actually go.
[160.74s -> 163.70s]  You're just sitting there silently watching chat like a creep. That's correct.
[164.90s -> 171.14s]  That's that's a 100% correct statement. Anytime I tell you guys, oh, I'll be right back in the
[171.14s -> 175.85s]  grab yourself some drink. I hit the mute button and I stand here. I just sit here and
[177.53s -> 190.46s]  uh-oh here it comes. Okay, there we go. Yeah, I just sit here and stare. First joke of the
[190.46s -> 197.51s]  night. It's weird because like you guys don't know what I'm doing. I could be doing
[197.51s -> 201.90s]  anything when I hit that mute button, but typically I'll sit there and make sure my
[201.90s -> 205.90s]  tweet went through and then I'll stare at chat for a little bit. Well, you know,
[206.62s -> 210.14s]  because it takes a while for people to realize that there's a stream going on or if they're
[210.14s -> 215.10s]  watching somebody else, maybe they stay there. Maybe they see the notification and get over
[215.10s -> 221.70s]  there quick. Uh, but you know, maybe like 10 minutes. I like to kind of just, just relax,
[221.70s -> 227.00s]  you know, you know, you could be, you could be watching anyone on Twitch. I don't listen.
[227.00s -> 231.80s]  You see that J that J nine eight five fucking pop up window in the top right corner
[232.44s -> 237.00s]  and you go like this and you can't, you do, you miss it like four times because you're like,
[237.00s -> 248.52s]  I can't, I have to go now. No, I'm just kidding. That's what I just did.
[250.28s -> 263.22s]  You think way too highly of yourself. I'm just kidding. That's a joke.
[264.17s -> 270.30s]  If you're new to the stream, we go back and forth both. Hey, if you're new to the stream,
[272.22s -> 281.74s]  welcome to one of the top 1000 Twitch broadcasters. No self-esteem allowed. No,
[281.74s -> 289.30s]  just a, just enough, just enough, right? Cause all my self-esteem is about to go off the window
[289.30s -> 294.02s]  when I can't find the guy I need to talk to in the first tutorial in the game. You know what
[294.02s -> 300.18s]  I mean? Oh man, like top 1000 Twitch streamer. Okay. Welcome. Okay guys. How are you? I'm
[300.18s -> 304.34s]  pretty great. And then I'm going to miss a blip and I'm going to drive by the same blip
[304.34s -> 310.95s]  like three times. So like that's probably that. And then I'll be like,
[310.95s -> 321.37s]  yeah. All the confidence just falls off the cliff. No, all jokes aside. Welcome. Have a great day.
[322.25s -> 334.46s]  That's not the button I wanted to press, but still whatever. I've got, I've got a,
[334.46s -> 338.22s]  I have a stream deck now and it's actually pretty interesting because I can do so much
[338.22s -> 347.91s]  weird shit with it. There we go. Oh, he's really scruffy. He's wearing a wig. Oh,
[347.91s -> 352.31s]  and by the way, I was able to pause it right at the opening cut scene. So take a look at
[352.31s -> 365.64s]  that. Wait, I got to make sure everyone's ready. Are you everybody ready? No, not yet. Okay.
[366.36s -> 377.58s]  Okay. I'll wait till you're ready. The story. Were you ready? You guys ready? Okay. So far
[378.79s -> 384.87s]  agent 47 and his handler, Diana Burnwood are the world's top assassins working for the ICA
[385.75s -> 390.47s]  when all of their recent missions turn out to be contracts at Sean Bean client,
[390.55s -> 396.39s]  things take an unexpected turn. There's revolver also have been operatives in an
[396.39s -> 402.87s]  invisible organization known as Providence. Providence has infiltrated the highest echelons
[402.87s -> 410.70s]  of power and secretly owns our world. The shadow of Sean Bean wages a silent war against
[410.70s -> 415.90s]  them. And so the constant Providence is enigmatic controller. You're going to
[415.90s -> 423.18s]  get sick. Track down and eliminate the shadow client. In return, he offers something
[423.18s -> 430.78s]  irresistible. The truth of 47 lost origins. We don't know where he's from. The man they hunt
[430.78s -> 437.74s]  is 47 childhood friend. It's gonna be really and unlike 47 normal, right? He remembers
[437.74s -> 445.94s]  everything. Oh, agent 47's past that we did not know before. Nice. He's from Ontario.
[447.22s -> 470.98s]  Whatever. Quebec, actually, but okay. Oh, this looks good. This looks slick. All right. I didn't
[470.98s -> 475.56s]  like relax. I've been looking forward to this game for a long time, though. Like the first
[475.56s -> 486.71s]  one was so fun. This is actually like runs beautifully. Hold on a second. I need to change
[486.71s -> 498.86s]  this. I'm also keyboard. You're gonna take it's always so high at fucking DPI. Wait,
[499.02s -> 503.22s]  wait a minute. Hold on. Can I press the DPI button? Oh, I can.
[503.94s -> 511.72s]  Understood. Reynard's house is just up the beach. Our intel indicates that she and her team
[511.72s -> 515.96s]  are laying low, most likely planning the militia's next strike. Reynard is one of the
[515.96s -> 521.72s]  shadow clients top lieutenants, and yet she's not a target. Not yet anyway. She's no doubt
[521.72s -> 527.64s]  high on our client's list. But for now, it's information we seek. Infiltrate the house.
[527.64s -> 532.04s]  I can't play in the water. I want to go like splash around in the water.
[532.12s -> 542.95s]  On my way. Search the house for Intel on the shadow client. Bones. Dinosaur bones. 47,
[542.95s -> 555.22s]  those are trekkie otopto bones. A land animal from the Jurassic period. This game looks
[555.22s -> 561.62s]  amazing. Like I'll say it again. Press C to sneak. The first Hitman was my favorite
[561.62s -> 566.58s]  game to come out a couple years ago. So you have to imagine that it's just more.
[568.54s -> 574.55s]  All right, so we get to sneak into the penthouse. I'm gonna get Intel. Is this how the UI is?
[578.06s -> 582.78s]  All right, I just sneak around in the grass. And if there's a brick, I'm throwing a brick
[582.78s -> 591.16s]  through the window. Control is the instinct. Okay, we've got a diaper up there, a diaper
[591.16s -> 603.93s]  over there. Depends on which diaper I want to use. Okay, I mean, that's a security camera.
[606.71s -> 612.84s]  I definitely don't want to walk in front of the security camera. Why go in here and
[613.48s -> 617.64s]  rob this guy or kill this guy or whatever? I could just come here every day and just watch
[617.64s -> 624.47s]  whatever movie he's watching. I could bring my whole family out here and we could just call
[624.47s -> 630.92s]  his house and inception shit into his head. If we wanted to watch Infinity War tonight,
[630.92s -> 636.20s]  bring the whole family out here. Just call them. Be like, oh yeah, sir, this is your
[636.20s -> 640.36s]  credit card company. We didn't want to make sure that we declined that purchase that you
[640.44s -> 647.24s]  made of the rental of Infinity War, one of the top movies of one of the top movies of 2018.
[647.24s -> 651.56s]  I just want to make sure and highly rated too. Do you want to accept those charges? Are you
[651.56s -> 655.88s]  sitting down tonight? Are you in front of your couch? Oh, fuck, dude, I want to accept those
[655.88s -> 670.44s]  charges. And then we like all sit down and we just watch. Okay, well, here's I guess I
[670.44s -> 680.92s]  can stop crouching. Equip your pistol. I and then enter. Sorry, I had to. All right,
[680.92s -> 700.04s]  destroy camera. I want to. There we go. It's broken. Oh, that feels clean.
[700.68s -> 710.50s]  That didn't destroy it. Got it. Good day. Now, according to the local home security provider,
[710.50s -> 715.70s]  the house is equipped with multiple cameras around the perimeter. I suggest you get rid of
[715.70s -> 746.33s]  them. But I can't. I don't want to do that. Oh, I guess. Come on. I got it. I think that
[746.33s -> 760.94s]  should be it. That's the that's the last camera, I think. Right. Got that one. Okay.
[760.94s -> 771.14s]  There's a couple of options. There's one over here. And I already saw them. I'm so excited
[771.14s -> 778.15s]  to play this game. Can you tell? Hey, can you tell guys? There's one over there too.
[778.15s -> 783.53s]  Can I get that long range? Check this to I'm so good at everything.
[792.12s -> 804.84s]  At everything. Okay, we got we got a screwdriver. In this case, we need it.
[811.70s -> 822.46s]  That's me. That's me. Okay. Yeah, guys. I'm so good at everything, even though I can't
[822.46s -> 829.30s]  even determine what my own reflection is. Alright, search the house into holstering,
[829.30s -> 848.20s]  holster an item. All right, you look at the Intel. Oh, you gotta love that noise.
[848.84s -> 863.94s]  They thought of everything. All right, open door G. I can't I'm actually able to go key
[863.94s -> 874.25s]  use the key missing. Okay, I need a key. We tend to keep looking around here for Intel.
[879.70s -> 890.04s]  Smash the door. Wait a minute Intel short circuit with the run over your garage.
[890.28s -> 902.23s]  You take your garage door opener. There we go. What's all this? What is aiming down here?
[903.61s -> 906.01s]  Is it a disco ball? Or is this something I need to pay attention to?
[923.66s -> 946.98s]  All right, G. Oh, 30s. Executed. I see them. Bastards. Looks like Reynard's grizzly
[946.98s -> 952.26s]  handiwork. All right. He was never shy about collateral damage. The owners don't think so.
[952.26s -> 957.46s]  The house is registered to a non-existing environmental NGO. This feels more like identity
[957.46s -> 963.46s]  theft. Like you, Reynard is known to use disguises. Toy, I'm dealing with another 47.
[964.18s -> 972.44s]  Nothing we can do for these people now. Okay, I got Intel f1. Murder victims. A deceased couple
[972.44s -> 976.52s]  of people have been discovered in the garage and the cause of death appears to be execution.
[976.52s -> 979.56s]  There it didn't. We just she just told us all these. She just told us everything.
[980.36s -> 988.26s]  All right, search the house for Intel. We've got some stuff to look at here. I don't like,
[988.26s -> 996.66s]  I don't like G. Masks, rope, chloroform. Looks like another kidnapping. I wouldn't put it past
[996.66s -> 1001.62s]  them. I think I'll test it to see if it works. If not industrious. Why is he doing this?
[1001.62s -> 1006.10s]  Clearly he has an axe to grind with Providence. Big enough to surround himself
[1006.10s -> 1010.74s]  with murderers and terrorists. Big enough not to care who gets hurt in the process.
[1011.38s -> 1016.26s]  He believes he's doing the right thing, I suppose. Just like everyone else. Diana,
[1017.30s -> 1031.30s]  if I stop talking, I drank too much chloroform. Tell my son his trush fund password is 1-1-1-1.
[1032.50s -> 1050.57s]  Why am I doing all this? Um, oh, these all work. I'm just a maintenance guy testing QA.
[1051.21s -> 1059.05s]  I can't unlock. Why am I holding a car battery? I don't know. I need a lockpick.
[1059.69s -> 1068.17s]  We got, uh, expired can of spaghetti sauce. And you can spaghetti sauce people. This might be
[1068.17s -> 1074.58s]  the best game ever. You know what I'm saying? Like, all I want is to be able to spaghetti sauce
[1074.58s -> 1077.62s]  people in the head. Like, that's all I want. It's the only thing I've ever wanted in a
[1077.62s -> 1095.51s]  video game. And apparently it's here. Do I need this? Ooh, what's on TV today?
[1096.23s -> 1107.46s]  Oh, we got, looks like the window blinds. Oh, yeah, turn them off. Make sure nobody can see in here.
[1109.96s -> 1125.32s]  Piano. Close them all. Oh, this is the other side of the window. What do we got? Intel.
[1129.05s -> 1157.24s]  Phone ringing. Bathroom ventilation system. What a weird sink. Oh god, it actually works!
[1158.76s -> 1167.27s]  What? Holy shit, your sink sucks. Uh, can you come and fix the sink instead? Because I just
[1167.27s -> 1173.46s]  turned my water on and within five seconds my whole bathroom flooded. The design of that
[1173.46s -> 1178.47s]  sink is not good. What about the shower? Is it actually going to fill the whole place?
[1181.27s -> 1208.90s]  Let's do it! What the fuck? Hold on, so you can, you can like throw a toaster and you...
[1210.55s -> 1217.51s]  Okay, that's fucking ridiculous. 47, I'm trying to find Intel. Diana,
[1218.39s -> 1224.74s]  Intel on the criminal. I don't know that throwing a car battery while standing in water
[1224.74s -> 1228.28s]  is a bad idea. Eat shit!
[1234.20s -> 1253.35s]  Wait, did somebody just say frame rate? Are we losing frames? It's fine? It's all right?
[1254.15s -> 1261.51s]  Okay, it should be somewhere close to 60. All right, let's go. Well, that's,
[1261.51s -> 1267.43s]  that's an indication of what's to come. This already is my favorite game of the year.
[1268.23s -> 1269.91s]  That's all it took. Seriously.
[1279.02s -> 1289.42s]  No, I can't, I can't just do this. No, I can't! I have to get out of here. Can I get in
[1289.42s -> 1314.41s]  the bathtub and turn the water on? I don't think I can. No, I can't get it now. Got it. I just have
[1314.41s -> 1323.54s]  to sneak and get it. All right, is there anything else? He says the bathroom ventilation system,
[1323.54s -> 1331.18s]  he said, was fucked up, right? I don't even, I need this key. I gotta go in like his bedroom.
[1331.74s -> 1344.36s]  It's a nice house. Curt, I can just, can I hide in here or is this... Okay. I'm sorry
[1344.36s -> 1351.10s]  I'm taking so long doing this. I'm just, I just love this game. Okay, found the bedroom.
[1351.66s -> 1360.25s]  I don't know, I think maybe I shouldn't close up blinds. There's a lot of places to,
[1360.25s -> 1369.70s]  holy shit. All right, settle down. What have we got? A drink, glass of whiskey.
[1370.34s -> 1391.22s]  I don't even know whose this is. Oh my god, really? Like, this, there's so many things. It's
[1391.22s -> 1397.64s]  like a dead rising, the amount of random things you can just pick up here. Okay, did I miss
[1397.64s -> 1414.89s]  anything? Let's go this way. All right, there's a computer over there. Wait, camera. No,
[1414.89s -> 1423.86s]  I already got it. I can't get through this door. All right, I need to get to that computer.
[1429.53s -> 1437.24s]  All right, this way. Uh, I didn't look over this way though. Let's check the other side.
[1438.58s -> 1442.42s]  Uh, there is a bench over here. I don't know what this has anything to do with Intel,
[1442.42s -> 1459.10s]  but I have it. Oh, what's this? Coin. Why is it all the way out here? Blend in.
[1461.62s -> 1465.38s]  All right, I'm sorry guys, but like, if somebody happens to be swimming in the
[1465.38s -> 1470.81s]  ocean right now, I'm sorry. You know what I'm saying? But it's going to happen. I'm sorry.
[1474.50s -> 1488.36s]  I just electrocuted everybody that was in the ocean. I'm playing Hitman though. I had to
[1488.36s -> 1494.60s]  test it. What's this? Fire poker. Oh, more tools to fucking go crazy with upstairs. Wait.
[1494.60s -> 1501.19s]  Yeah. Think of all the fish. That's like, that's like 600 million fish that I just
[1501.19s -> 1504.79s]  fried right there. So you can see even the bird, like all the fish coming out.
[1505.51s -> 1510.57s]  They're like getting fried and flying up in the air. See, those are those are fish
[1510.57s -> 1513.45s]  that are fucking flying out of the ocean. Cause the electricity is just everywhere.
[1514.09s -> 1537.58s]  This looks like something I can do here. Maybe not. What about with this? Can I like
[1537.58s -> 1553.51s]  break this thing? Poison. The panic room ventilation. Uh, I'm just fucking up this
[1553.51s -> 1561.21s]  guy's whole house. I'm poisoning every inch of this guy's house. Poisoning. Hey,
[1561.21s -> 1565.61s]  your panic room, your whiskey. Where is this person? All right. That's okay. Panic room
[1565.61s -> 1580.26s]  ventilation. That's, this is the bathroom up here. This is solar panels. Okay. So the real
[1580.26s -> 1588.14s]  question is how do I get to the room with the computer? Cause this brings me back here. I need
[1588.14s -> 1601.43s]  to get in there. I think it wasn't already in there. Unlock the door. Come on. Can't pick the
[1601.43s -> 1617.34s]  lock. Crowbar. Can't break it open. Where's my quick like weapon wheel? Go into the panic
[1617.34s -> 1631.99s]  room and breathe heavily. God damn it. Do I not? I don't know. I thought I had a crowbar.
[1631.99s -> 1645.11s]  I did before. Where is it? No, it's a lead pipe wrench screwdriver. I can't unlock the
[1645.11s -> 1658.68s]  screwdriver. Did I lock myself out of the house? How did I lock myself out of the house?
[1662.33s -> 1681.16s]  Did I press a button and lock the doors? All right. Well, this is, I was already here.
[1683.83s -> 1690.90s]  I like went through this whole house already. Go to the garage. What the hell is their garage?
[1697.06s -> 1711.22s]  How did I, how did I do this? What do you mean the garage? What, what's in the garage?
[1711.86s -> 1723.19s]  The most, yeah, I, I know the moment the dead people, but did I like fuck up the whole
[1723.19s -> 1772.66s]  house? I can't unlock this either. Stop. Stop it. All right. Computer. This thing's got
[1772.66s -> 1786.62s]  to drive me crazy. I'm going to go upstairs. This is going to drive me crazy. 47, that computer.
[1786.62s -> 1795.78s]  Got the computer. Can't access it. Encrypted. Assuming there's a key,
[1795.78s -> 1802.10s]  Reina wouldn't just leave it lying around. Wait, according to the floor plan,
[1802.10s -> 1806.66s]  the room you're in should be a lot bigger. Okay. Might be a concealed space behind the wall.
[1806.66s -> 1824.95s]  Check the hidden panels. 47. She's still talking out there. Alexa. Alexa. Alexa, stop. Alexa.
[1825.59s -> 1846.06s]  Play season one of house. MD. Got it. This should be interesting. Panic room. Oh, oh,
[1846.06s -> 1865.62s]  wait, hold on. This is the panic room. Should I not be in there? All right. I'm ready.
[1876.78s -> 1881.83s]  Nicely done. 47. Password dongle. To move more freely. Here we go.
[1882.55s -> 1891.93s]  For the office computer, no doubt. What about this one? Okay. See, I unlocked the shortcut.
[1896.49s -> 1902.17s]  Kidnapping plan. It appears Reynald's cell is launching another strike. There's a sewer
[1902.17s -> 1906.81s]  house of a residential area in Wellington. Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
[1906.81s -> 1912.97s]  Our priority is the shadow client. I got it. I got it. I got it. Everyone just relax.
[1913.93s -> 1933.18s]  Okay. Back up to the... I'm sorry, Alexa, but you made me do this.
[1934.14s -> 1959.90s]  Where are you, Alexa? Thank God. Until they work the bugs out. They'll send me another one.
[1959.90s -> 1965.34s]  I'm detecting movement up the road. A motorcade. Possibly Reynald's. Uploading the data. Hold on.
[1966.54s -> 1973.90s]  Receiving it now. Nothing on the shadow client or the other cells. No names. No aliases.
[1974.54s -> 1978.76s]  I doubt she even knows whom she's working for. Wait. Here's something.
[1979.56s -> 1984.20s]  A message from Robert Knox of Cronstadt Industries. And by the sound of it...
[1984.20s -> 1990.12s]  Crunk. Crunk. Crunk. A defector. Well, well, well. Client won't like this one bit.
[1990.12s -> 1997.88s]  And you can't wait to tell him. They're back. Hostiles. I see them. Damn. Here we go.
[1997.88s -> 2002.68s]  Okay. We've got all we're going to get. Go to stage two, 47. Stage two. Eliminate Reynald,
[2002.68s -> 2005.96s]  and preferably without raising suspicion. One step ahead of the shadow client.
[2005.96s -> 2008.36s]  What about the grenade I threw in his living room? Let's keep it that way.
[2009.24s -> 2015.21s]  Oh. This guy walks in. Alexa. Alexa two and Alexa three.
[2016.33s -> 2018.81s]  What a snob. Where's my trio of Alexas?
[2018.81s -> 2023.51s]  You didn't even miss out on the action. I'm sorry you had to endure all that free
[2023.51s -> 2028.47s]  champagne and cello music, Orson. What can I say? You really took one for the team.
[2028.47s -> 2030.79s]  Well, I say stick to what you know.
[2048.25s -> 2053.14s]  Drag me out into the street and shoot me.
[2057.19s -> 2060.95s]  I'm equalizing, guys. I want to make it like it's like John Wick 3. That's going to happen.
[2061.75s -> 2071.30s]  There's going to be a huge fight and John Wick is going to run out of bullets. And then the
[2072.18s -> 2075.94s]  antagonist is going to run out of bullets. And then there's going to be like a pipe on
[2075.94s -> 2080.26s]  the ground and like a butter knife on the like right next to him. He's like a restaurant.
[2080.34s -> 2087.98s]  And he's going to be like, hey, you out? Yeah, I'm out. Huh. What do you say we do this
[2088.87s -> 2091.51s]  the old fashioned way? He's going to throw the butter knife over like this.
[2092.23s -> 2106.15s]  How do you throw harder? Go and see what it is.
[2109.59s -> 2126.15s]  How do you? I want to throw it harder. Oh, come on. Oh, that don't work.
[2126.23s -> 2167.24s]  All right. All right. Okay. Still one of their cars. Silent takedown for that. What? Oh,
[2170.01s -> 2190.70s]  this isn't this is not the simulator. I'm currently concealed. What's with that blur?
[2195.32s -> 2201.21s]  Game really does not want me to be over here. That was a really good silent explosion.
[2201.85s -> 2218.95s]  Body found. Oh, no. Come on. I got silent kill. What's this blurry shit? Am I game broken?
[2219.75s -> 2231.00s]  How do I like? Oh, oh, fuck. Oh, I shouldn't have done that. I didn't even need to do that.
[2231.72s -> 2242.79s]  This is so far away. Have discovered your boat 47. They're on high alert,
[2242.79s -> 2264.17s]  combing the beach for intruders. I skipped this whole mission. Well, I did it. Wait,
[2264.25s -> 2267.77s]  this guy turns around. Should I squeak? Should I kill this guy with a squeaky toy?
[2279.98s -> 2284.01s]  Can I squeak it? I wish I could just press a button and have it go like,
[2284.97s -> 2304.01s]  oh, man, my game's actually kind of running like shit. Oh, right. Squeaky toy assassin
[2304.01s -> 2310.41s]  kill here. Squeaky toy kill. I'm going to stuff it down his throat. See it's in his mouth.
[2310.97s -> 2330.76s]  Still got it in my hands. No way to get past them unnoticed. I suggest you cause a
[2330.76s -> 2336.12s]  distraction. 47. I'm gonna have to like turn something off. A distraction. Okay. I can do
[2336.12s -> 2355.35s]  that. No, I can't. Right. Loud. Squeaky toys a lot. The thing just exploded. Shit. All right.
[2355.35s -> 2373.74s]  Hold on. Let me like turn off a couple of settings. I don't think I can. Super sampling.
[2373.74s -> 2384.42s]  Level of detail. Texture quality. 1080. Let's turn that off. Ambient occlusion.
[2385.14s -> 2397.00s]  How's that do? That feels a lot better. Holy shit. This game with the ambient occlusion
[2397.00s -> 2403.05s]  on just, just kills my frames. Well, nevermind. It's back. All right. Here we go.
[2404.17s -> 2408.89s]  Uh, I, I'm just going to throw a coin. Does it, will it make a loud noise on the,
[2408.89s -> 2414.28s]  no, hold on a minute. It's like, dude, I'm not doing something over there. Watch this.
[2418.65s -> 2423.66s]  Okay. Here we go. Got one. Well, he looked like he was about to look.
[2423.66s -> 2430.94s]  What if I just go over here? Will they see me if I do this?
[2431.42s -> 2499.14s]  Hey, you'll want to have a look. Guys. All right. Well, there it is. Flawless.
[2501.58s -> 2515.03s]  Hey, they said make a loud distraction. Excellent work. 47. Ooh. Suit only. Mastermind.
[2515.67s -> 2520.50s]  Don't tread on me. Discover a hawks Bay. So that's interesting. You can see, you could do
[2522.97s -> 2526.81s]  I saw. Okay. There's a lot of things I could do there besides the role of grenade in front
[2526.81s -> 2553.98s]  of her. All right. Well, that was funny. That was fun. I just got to, I'm, I'm streaming it
[2553.98s -> 2558.78s]  at 60 FPS right now and playing at 60 FPS. That might not, that might not be a good idea.
[2558.78s -> 2568.46s]  I might have to tone it down a little. I got one star on the tutorial. Yeah. Cause
[2568.46s -> 2588.71s]  I threw a grenade three times in somebody's living room. So here's the interesting thing
[2588.71s -> 2593.99s]  about, uh, numbering your games and redoing them and redoing them and making new sequels
[2593.99s -> 2599.61s]  and sequels and sequels. The client has given us carte blanche hunt down the militia
[2599.61s -> 2604.33s]  30 years from now. How many hitman twos in the building? Providence was a threat.
[2605.05s -> 2610.57s]  How did you swing the board? The board of practical people. 47, a blank check.
[2611.29s -> 2616.09s]  What are the four hitman twos? The shadow clients war on Providence is causing a global
[2616.09s -> 2622.41s]  panic. Someone will need to stop the militia might as well be us. And the man on the
[2622.41s -> 2633.06s]  train taking a contract for personal gain is against ICA regulations. She's supposed
[2633.06s -> 2638.02s]  to be targeting sodas would have been proud. Oh no, I thought I had a broken game. It's just
[2638.02s -> 2646.06s]  a whatever next crying at the movies. Why are you doing this? I know what it's like to have
[2646.06s -> 2652.49s]  everything. I know what it's like to lose claims to know about your past, your childhood,
[2652.49s -> 2658.70s]  your memories, everything. Old Maya stole from you and you trust him about as far as I can
[2658.70s -> 2665.50s]  throw him. But this is our best lead in 20 years. I say it's time we break a few rules.
[2667.50s -> 2676.73s]  I mean, I'm not going to give deduct points for that. I mean, honestly, in a game like
[2676.73s -> 2682.17s]  this, do you really matter if it's like a cinematic kind of like comic book style
[2682.25s -> 2688.30s]  cinematic? Like that's a lot of development times, a lot of animation, like spend the money on like
[2688.30s -> 2697.54s]  throwing bricks at people. You know what I mean? Like they did. We can see you haven't
[2697.54s -> 2700.50s]  completed your training. We recommend that you complete advanced agent training before
[2700.50s -> 2708.14s]  continuing the story. Okay, fine. I'll do my homework. I also have to walk around a
[2708.14s -> 2719.43s]  little bit and make sure that I can stream this at 60. But it's just the training from
[2719.43s -> 2727.78s]  the first game. Oh, is it really? Oh, damn it is. But let me just make sure it wasn't
[2728.66s -> 2733.54s]  just that level. Welcome to the agent program. This is running fine. I'll be waiting for you
[2733.54s -> 2753.93s]  inside. Follow the lines. Okay, how do I leave? What the hell is going on right now?
[2755.11s -> 2759.51s]  Pro tip it hit man and then hit man too. Is it? Do they have the other game in here?
[2765.48s -> 2772.74s]  Really? Hold on a second. So you get the first all the episodes from the first game,
[2772.74s -> 2776.26s]  the second game and then this other little campaign for one for the same price.
[2783.24s -> 2787.80s]  Oh, okay. If you own it already. Okay. All right. Like I was gonna say, holy shit.
[2788.92s -> 2793.24s]  All right. So we got blank check and then here's the first mission finish line.
[2794.28s -> 2803.00s]  Good afternoon, 47. Your destination is the annual global innovation motor race in Miami,
[2803.00s -> 2807.16s]  Florida. That would've been crazy. After analyzing the data from Reynard's computer,
[2807.16s -> 2812.12s]  the case is clear. The providence defectors are Robert and Sierra Knox,
[2812.12s -> 2819.88s]  head of robotics, developer Cronstadt industries, a visionary inventor and technological innovator.
[2819.88s -> 2823.08s]  Robert Knox has spearheaded Cronstadt. That's not a very good food for him.
[2825.96s -> 2831.88s]  Where's the whole grain is equally. Not only a financial wizard, but also
[2831.88s -> 2835.96s]  a fiercely competitive race car driver with a fiery temper to match
[2835.96s -> 2837.76s]  it.
[2837.76s -> 2839.19s]  Cronstadt.
[2839.19s -> 2841.19s]  BBA.
[2850.39s -> 2857.93s]  Last year, despotic ruler Jin Po employed prototype Cronstadt drones against peaceful
[2857.93s -> 2863.45s]  civilian protesters in the now infamous Tungan Valley incident. And although it has yet to be
[2863.45s -> 2869.93s]  proven, there is little doubt that the Knox's personally broke the deal, making them complicit
[2869.93s -> 2878.62s]  in a war crime. It is unclear why the Knox's would betray their masters, but likely the fear
[2878.62s -> 2883.26s]  of being next on the shadow clients hit list has pressured them to cut a deal with the enemy.
[2884.14s -> 2888.94s]  Undoubtedly with Cronstadt industries on their side, the militia will increase their attacks
[2888.94s -> 2895.10s]  tenfold. And so our contract obligates us to retire Robert and Sierra Knox and contain
[2895.10s -> 2899.58s]  the damage they may inflict on Providence. I believe you.
[2911.18s -> 2920.18s]  So let's take a look. Objectives. Let's just see. Target Sierra Knox. Eliminate using any
[2920.18s -> 2924.98s]  method and you can wear any disguise. Kill conditions and intel. We don't really have much.
[2925.86s -> 2933.06s]  She suffers from inferiority conflicts in relation to her father. Highly invested in the Cronstadt
[2933.06s -> 2938.98s]  racing team and is the company's lead driver. Okay, so this is the driver. And then we got
[2938.98s -> 2948.14s]  Robert Knox. Any method, any disguise. Let's see, let's pick out one because technical
[2948.14s -> 2952.54s]  skills and reputation catch the attention of a powerful group of people. The race's CEO
[2952.54s -> 2955.82s]  killings Knox feels the ground burning beneath his feet and so makes another bold
[2955.82s -> 2959.50s]  life decision. He contacts the terrorists through a dark web connection and offers him a deal.
[2960.54s -> 2967.99s]  And you spare him to get the digital keys to his Warcraft account. All right, planning.
[2967.99s -> 2973.91s]  Smuggled item. What do we got? Complete additional challenges to unlock. So this
[2973.91s -> 2979.13s]  is the only place I can put it and I don't, do I have anything? What do I want to put
[2979.13s -> 2990.39s]  in here? Pistols. I mean, the pale duck. There's an explosive duck in the game. Suit.
[2990.39s -> 2997.54s]  Florida suit. All right, yeah. And start of the event. We're just gonna do it the
[2998.18s -> 3005.88s]  way that it's supposed to be done. So difficulty. Professional. Assassination is serious business.
[3005.88s -> 3009.08s]  You plan, you execute, you escape, and your handler is right there giving you the guidance
[3009.08s -> 3013.16s]  you need to succeed. Unlimited saves. All mission story guides available. Surveillance
[3013.16s -> 3017.16s]  cameras active. Cameras alert. Guards have illegal activity. Spotted combat is challenging
[3017.16s -> 3026.60s]  but fair. That's fine. I'm not doing master. The missions in Hitman can be solved in
[3026.60s -> 3029.80s]  countless ways. One approach is to uncover some of the many missions stories and follow
[3029.80s -> 3033.24s]  them through. When you uncover a mission story, you will have an opportunity to get
[3033.24s -> 3036.92s]  help and guidance. Since this is your first time in Miami, you may choose to have a
[3036.92s -> 3046.87s]  guide active from the get-go. I don't think I'm, I don't think I need to do that. No,
[3046.87s -> 3060.58s]  it's uncovered. I don't want a guide. This is how the other game worked. You kind of
[3060.58s -> 3064.90s]  stumble upon objectives and intel and you can choose to act on it or not, right?
[3065.70s -> 3076.65s]  You kind of just have to walk around and look at stuff. This is a great intro
[3077.37s -> 3081.85s]  to like a real estate infomercial. The innovation race is on its last day
[3081.85s -> 3087.66s]  and it is down to the wire. Thousands of eager fans are gathered for the final
[3087.66s -> 3094.22s]  lapse of this unexpectedly close race. Sierra Knox is expertly piloting her red
[3094.22s -> 3100.78s]  Kronstadt car. Her father, Robert Knox, roams the nearby Expo building where Kronstadt
[3100.86s -> 3106.62s]  is showcasing its new prototype car. Cool balloons. The Kronstadt RK Mark III has
[3106.62s -> 3111.26s]  seen fierce competition from the Chinese Kaowoon Heavy Industries new racer.
[3112.46s -> 3117.26s]  Moses Lee, CEO of Kaowoon, has taken a dominant lead. Can I drive?
[3119.26s -> 3125.62s]  There's like endless amounts of things I want to do here.
[3128.02s -> 3155.67s]  Is this just a CEO race? Oh man. Eliminate Sierra Knox, eliminate Robert Knox.
[3157.27s -> 3160.30s]  What are you doing, Otto? What's the matter?
[3163.05s -> 3188.18s]  Okay, so I mean I see the guy in the mascot suit. I'm out of here. Who is that?
[3190.84s -> 3195.86s]  Don't ever hand me a pantslet again. All right, hold on. Otto, what's the matter?
[3201.51s -> 3212.44s]  No, don't load that. Just replay. Here, please go throw away this card.
[3213.72s -> 3218.68s]  Yeah, I know. I understand. It's like just, you know, have a big sign with all your info
[3218.68s -> 3223.48s]  on it, right? People hand out pamphlets and, how do I skip this? There you go.
[3224.12s -> 3229.32s]  Like people hand out pamphlets and, oh here's this. Take this. No, just stand next to a
[3229.32s -> 3234.36s]  giant sign and have it say, add a funny Snapchat filter if you take a picture in
[3234.36s -> 3246.65s]  front of the sign. Pamphlets, people just throw them away. What do we got here? Wire.
[3249.50s -> 3256.23s]  So the Global Innovation Race is a major sporting event taking place in Miami every year
[3256.23s -> 3260.23s]  besides the endurance race itself, which runs over the course of two days. The social aspect
[3260.23s -> 3263.83s]  of the race has exploded over the years, going from being mostly an enthusiast event,
[3264.55s -> 3268.07s]  it's now a major public event complete with exclusive areas for VIPs.
[3268.87s -> 3273.03s]  Okay, the exclusive driver's lounge features nightly parties and often sees the attendance
[3273.03s -> 3277.50s]  of various celebrities. So here's the driver's lounge and here's the entrance. So the
[3277.50s -> 3282.30s]  driver's lounge is to the right. Okay, interesting intel. Give me a second. I have
[3282.30s -> 3286.46s]  bring Otto downstairs because I think he might have to pee. So give me one second, I'll be right
[3286.46s -> 3473.64s]  back. All right, I'm gonna need to run back down there in just a minute. Let's grab something.
[3474.44s -> 3485.53s]  But anyways, okay, so here's the entrance. Welcome. Oh, no, I have no items. Okay,
[3487.42s -> 3490.47s]  that's fine. Why do I have to, I don't have to wait in line.
[3490.47s -> 3495.86s]  Okay, thank you, sir. This will be over in no time. Why do I have to wait in line?
[3498.28s -> 3502.22s]  Okay, let's go, sir. Thank you. All right.
[3506.44s -> 3518.62s]  Oh, man, this is wild. Can I take this car? Free photo shoot. Blending into the crowd. Yeah,
[3518.62s -> 3528.10s]  I mean, this is so accurate. This is just too accurate. They have those like monster
[3528.18s -> 3540.57s]  boots. Goodbye, man. Grab a can. Photo. Intel item. Let's see it. Flamingo mascot Polaroid. A
[3540.57s -> 3551.86s]  Polaroid picture of one of the race mascots dressed as a flamingo. Okay, just blending in.
[3552.66s -> 3561.24s]  So where are they? Well, there's the flamingo. Hold on. Let me see the flamingo. I have to
[3561.24s -> 3567.32s]  do the flamingo thing. You know what I mean? How could I not do the like Mario
[3567.40s -> 3582.47s]  card character? I need to like follow this guy around. He's all the way over there. She's
[3582.47s -> 3590.70s]  in the race, right? She's in the car. Hold on. I'm going to save it. Let's start a new slot
[3590.70s -> 3597.34s]  here because I'm not starting from the very beginning. I just want to look. So here's the
[3597.34s -> 3614.14s]  track. My god, this is so much. I want to get a good view. French fries, hamburgers.
[3616.01s -> 3624.38s]  How can I not do the Mario card character? I know. How much more is there? These outhouses.
[3625.78s -> 3631.53s]  Can I actually go see the track? Her car's out there.
[3632.57s -> 3636.02s]  Where does it come across? It comes across right here. Holy shit.
[3643.94s -> 3650.04s]  Wow. Wow. Can I be a crazy fan and like rush to like go run over there?
[3654.95s -> 3673.13s]  This race sucks. I can't jump over that. I can see. Hold on. There's a way over here.
[3673.13s -> 3686.09s]  Oh, there's a. Hold on. Let me just get a look. Police car down here. Exit. There's
[3686.09s -> 3698.70s]  got to be a way to get on the track, right? Okay. I'm not supposed to be in here.
[3700.15s -> 3704.82s]  All right. Parking. No, it's definitely not down here. It might be though.
[3707.35s -> 3716.09s]  Parking is the exit. No, let's try this way. I'm going to have to sneak through here up
[3716.09s -> 3727.27s]  and around. Yeah, I'm going to start over and do it again. I just need to see if I
[3727.27s -> 3741.83s]  can get over there. Oh, Jesus. No, I can't push them. All right. I'm going to put this on.
[3745.94s -> 3755.53s]  No, there's no cars to push them to do. Oh, they knew you were going to try to do it,
[3755.53s -> 3763.26s]  didn't they? They knew it. They put these barriers up here. Bastards. They put the
[3763.26s -> 3775.48s]  barriers. Oh, that's too bad. Dump. No, I want to dump them. If I'm going to dump
[3775.48s -> 3793.45s]  them, I'm dumping them like into the road. I might be able to do it. That's pretty close.
[3793.45s -> 3804.57s]  If it gets done correctly, I seem to wait for the one. Psycho. All right. Can I throw
[3804.57s -> 3812.58s]  them over though? That's the question. Nobody else on the other side here. There's people up
[3812.58s -> 3835.86s]  there. Dump. Okay. I'm going to wait for the next pass. And how about right now? Shit.

[7484.49s -> 7489.21s]  to get the overall story of the finish line we recommend that you complete the following
[7489.21s -> 7502.57s]  mission stories so i did this one play mission story or skip that's cool that's awesome well

[7582.42s -> 7588.50s]  shadow boxing we need to know who we are up against that's like every was getting to that
[7588.50s -> 7595.06s]  that's every like young anime villain in every anime you've ever watched is lucas gray the late
[7595.06s -> 7601.62s]  mr. cobbs head of security cob was ground zero first of our operatives to die
[7602.66s -> 7609.54s]  it had to be one of the staff someone with military training and access to the plane i think
[7609.54s -> 7619.14s]  it was 47 grasping at straws gray is a mercenary a veteran of every backwater tragedy you've
[7619.14s -> 7627.70s]  ever ignored on the five o'clock news chechnya sierra leone the list goes on but before 89
[7628.26s -> 7637.54s]  nothing no records of any kind event three cia kg scenes funniest spies went dark after the
[7637.54s -> 7644.36s]  curtain was lifted there uh i cast a very wide net lucas gray what's the in-between between

[7663.54s -> 7674.44s]  oh this is from the first game this hearts and flowers crap will get us both killed
[7675.69s -> 7681.29s]  can't you see your so-called friend is working for them now he's not the man you knew
[7681.37s -> 7690.95s]  this is his fight too even if he doesn't realize it like it or not 47 is our last and only lead on
[7690.95s -> 7697.51s]  the partners so he wasn't even a bad guy was he a good guy all the time he's coming for us

[7869.70s -> 7872.58s]  is not completely on their own with wonder brothers that was that was surprising actually
[7872.66s -> 7877.54s]  when the i saw the splash screen when i first turned it on wonder brothers i was like okay
[7878.58s -> 7888.84s]  so it was finally the wonder brothers game division was doing pretty well recently although
[7888.84s -> 7899.29s]  i mean i can't really say that for some of their movies is it still an episodic game or
[7899.29s -> 7908.65s]  did they release it all at once it is released all at once i believe or am i wrong no it's
[7908.65s -> 7919.69s]  here wait is it is it is it is it a swedish i thought they didn't do that this time no
[7919.69s -> 7928.15s]  because i can't well how would i be able to play this next mission all at once same format
[7928.15s -> 7933.83s]  of season one contact has shared the identity of the shadow client a former mercenary and
[7933.83s -> 7939.43s]  bodyguard that's good i'm glad they did it like this gray his past is a black void but
[7939.43s -> 7944.95s]  our analysts are digging deep meanwhile we've had a breakthrough of our own comparing the
[7944.95s -> 7950.15s]  malicious attack patterns with global shipping and transportation routes we figured out how mr
[7950.15s -> 7954.15s]  gray and his paramilitaries move around the world how's the frame rates in by the way
[7954.15s -> 7959.59s]  they're using the distribution network gotten more stable columbia's big you might be pushing
[7959.59s -> 7965.03s]  it here clearly gray must have struck a deal with it all good good consequently if we can
[7965.03s -> 7970.87s]  cripple the cartel we can severely limit the malicious strike range but to do so we need to
[7970.87s -> 7978.63s]  slay a three-headed serpent sociopathic cartel head rico delgado and his two closest lieutenants
[7978.63s -> 7986.31s]  pr guru andrea martinez and servant chemist for rey franco with equal parts guts and guile
[7986.31s -> 7992.23s]  rico delgado runs a thriving billion dollar criminal empire the word is the brutal and
[7992.23s -> 7998.15s]  volatile cartel head is hell bent on becoming the number one drug lord in the world drugs
[7998.23s -> 8003.83s]  to achieve this drug lord a childhood friend of delgado's has been buttering up state leaders
[8003.83s -> 8008.79s]  and decision makers paving the way for an expansion of the delgado logistics network
[8008.79s -> 8013.99s]  while the brilliant but aloof and anti-social franco has been hard at work developing a new
[8013.99s -> 8019.91s]  type of new candy recipe super cocaine columbia's most infamous crime lords
[8019.91s -> 8028.98s]  inhabiting a decidedly hostile environment i would leave you to prepare super cocaine
[8032.41s -> 8042.15s]  all right so we need to get rid of rico uh or hey and andrea andrea all three of them

[17503.26s -> 17512.62s]  back and see the story twice this game's fucking fun what a great game what a fun video game
[17513.26s -> 17520.50s]  i need to go up there uh can i cross through a demon you keep telling all the good stories
[17520.50s -> 17539.38s]  about him a freedom fighter straight this way across the beam or do i need to go across the
[17539.38s -> 17550.42s]  beam i need to get over there is there no other way for me to jump over there can i climb up
[17550.42s -> 17571.00s]  of that no really come on i can't get up there i can't traverse that damn it all right well i'm
[17571.00s -> 17582.90s]  just i'm gonna go the other way maybe it's a ladder this way what about right there i gotta
[17582.90s -> 17590.90s]  go up from here somehow there we go got it 47 this is one of the mumbai tools my records
[17590.90s -> 17595.70s]  show a few residential complaints about a new tenant in the building okay something related
[17595.70s -> 17608.02s]  to strange behavior might be worth looking into let's go pay him a visit strange tenant
[17609.14s -> 17621.80s]  i'm currently trespassing so you know how do you trespass in an apartment building
[17621.80s -> 17627.96s]  how could they not well well it appears we have a rival assassin in mumbai and he's training
[17627.96s -> 17633.72s]  his sights on darwood rangin by the looks of it i'd say we're dealing with a local operator
[17633.72s -> 17645.75s]  known as the cashmereian i'll never make the shot a local hitman known as the cashmereian
[17645.75s -> 17650.95s]  is in mumbai on business he set up a sniper nest in a tower above a stairwell in the local
[17650.95s -> 17664.54s]  tool it appears he's targeting okay good thinking 47 now if we could only make rangin
[17664.54s -> 17676.25s]  appear in that window somehow that scope adjusted with this quarter of viewfinder
[17677.21s -> 17707.53s]  why don't i why don't i just get a better view myself right i guess i'll just go over there
[17708.33s -> 17713.59s]  and then aim up into the window oh the scope isn't adjusted that's right
[17714.39s -> 17723.29s]  maybe i should take his clothes he's got a dongle laptop dongle apartment key
[17724.41s -> 17739.21s]  and he lives here not trespassing anymore all right so let me say this again so i need to
[17739.29s -> 17746.81s]  find a way to get his attention to get him to the window how do i get his attention
[17757.56s -> 17774.02s]  a coin a coin doesn't reach that far throw a soda can across the city i think they hit
[17774.02s -> 17786.78s]  somebody right in the head shoot the window to make him check the window why am i shooting
[17786.78s -> 17793.86s]  at him anyways what why don't i just take this who cares about that guy where's the guy i need
[17793.86s -> 17804.87s]  to kill he's like up there where's the other person i need to kill is it just two well there's
[17804.87s -> 17835.37s]  no okay i gotta he's inside the building just get his attention i mean i could shoot i could
[17835.37s -> 17843.72s]  shoot the window but that kind of defeats the purpose of being down here i have to
[17843.72s -> 17865.64s]  go all the way down i'm gonna try and shoot the window just to see what happens i can't
[17865.64s -> 17870.20s]  shoot it won't shoot until he's there so let's shoot with this and put it back
[17871.08s -> 17890.25s]  did you hear it shoot through his open window
[17917.51s -> 17974.94s]  and again he's here he comes shoot him what it didn't fire uh this is obviously not correct
[17974.94s -> 17979.10s]  backflip pogchamp all right well i'm gonna restart it and i'm gonna go into the apartment
[17979.10s -> 18003.77s]  building what is it shaking so violently if only you had a tripod this would go so much
[18003.77s -> 18021.80s]  more smoothly all right you all right so i'm gonna go to the apartment i have an apartment
[18021.80s -> 18031.58s]  key now i didn't shoot yet right no okay let's take a look i got a key let's examine see if i
[18031.58s -> 18036.54s]  can scream at him what maybe this probably maybe there's a megaphone in this apartment
[18036.54s -> 18052.63s]  somewhere those are some nice trees adjust the scope i did i adjusted the scope and he was like
[18052.63s -> 18064.65s]  good okay here we go apartment key 47 it appears the cashmereian is using this room as a base of
[18064.65s -> 18083.99s]  operations let's see what he's up to in here what the hell is he watching okay
[18087.02s -> 18096.01s]  we got oh lethal poison pills luggage gonna do anything with the luggage no okay pick up
[18096.01s -> 18104.79s]  picture of what picture of vanya surveillance image of vanya
[18106.15s -> 18110.95s]  overlooking the mumbai laundry business a note on the back says excellent position
[18110.95s -> 18119.35s]  meeting with foreman a surveillance image of toad rang in his tower it looks like he's
[18119.35s -> 18124.71s]  posing in front of a large canvas of some sort a note says in the back perfect shot painter
[18125.51s -> 18143.26s]  okay it's an old computer okay well that he i get that's different places i can
[18144.22s -> 18157.21s]  perch up interesting all right well it's giving me locations to where i can
[18165.69s -> 18175.88s]  nothing else open the fridge that's not the fridge that's not a fridge either this is a
[18175.88s -> 18182.50s]  fridge i can't open the fridge i can't open the fridge all right i'm going back up
[18183.61s -> 18201.08s]  i'm taking the sniper rifle i'm saying what is that an iron oh boy get and get people
[18201.08s -> 18209.26s]  out of my way good luck hiding it i'll just like drop it in trash cans and shit
[18209.98s -> 18235.37s]  let me look at the sniper rifle again so this can't be adjusted how am i going to get his
[18235.37s -> 18256.07s]  attention i don't get it i mean i i guess i can like i can use the sniper to shoot the other guy
[18266.70s -> 18301.96s]  wait a minute i can't do this oh he he is supposed to right so i can't do this well
[18305.53s -> 18361.00s]  don't tell me i can't do something um i was what i can't hide there
[18400.55s -> 18403.35s]  the gun doesn't fire i can't the gun doesn't fire
[18408.46s -> 18410.46s]  did i kill him in both scenarios
[18410.86s -> 18421.32s]  is he dead in both scenarios oh he's dead in both scenarios i saved it and saved it
[18421.32s -> 18436.26s]  fucking hell no i'm not i'm not going back all the way there it's gonna scare the
[18436.26s -> 18450.97s]  shit out of people watch i want this though okay what if i i don't want this guy's disguise
[18450.97s -> 18481.75s]  anymore i'm gonna put on the bodyguard costume wait what got it right okay
[18481.83s -> 18489.29s]  he's a traveling salesman or something 47 this is one of the mumbai chores my records show a
[18489.29s -> 18493.61s]  few residential complaints i was sitting there trying to figure out the whole time how to like
[18493.61s -> 18501.45s]  distract the guy might be worth looking into it turns out i killed the whole story mission
[18501.45s -> 18505.93s]  because i shot the guy with his own rifle that's how i'm understanding this right that's
[18505.93s -> 18535.75s]  correct did i miss the stairs okay here we go well well it appears we have a rival assassin
[18535.75s -> 18541.19s]  in mumbai and he's training his sights on darwood rangin by the looks of it i'd say
[18541.19s -> 18545.43s]  we're dealing with a local operator known as the cashmere i was wondering why the other
[18545.43s -> 18549.75s]  the hints stopped a local hitman known as the cashmereian
[18550.71s -> 18556.10s]  damn broken viewfinder if i can't adjust this good thinking 47
[18557.54s -> 18564.09s]  now if we could only make rangin appear in that window somehow oh my god this is
[18567.90s -> 18574.54s]  karen dar aka the cashmereian was born in the u.s but fled to his mother's native land india
[18574.54s -> 18579.82s]  20 years ago following an fbi investigation into a string of syrian killings in texas
[18580.62s -> 18584.78s]  he adopted a new identity here talk to the assassin as a gun for hire for local
[18584.78s -> 18592.30s]  mobsters no i'm not going to talk to who would want rangin dead how does a professional assassin
[18592.30s -> 18602.46s]  not know how to focus a scope i have no idea that's like the equivalent of knowing how to
[18602.46s -> 18612.06s]  draw with crayons as a child a toddler all right so now we have to make him go in the window
[18614.39s -> 18624.14s]  and then we have to find the maelstrom so how do i i'm going to distract him
[18626.58s -> 18639.96s]  infiltrate the apartment infiltrate the lounge save it okay so we're going to get up there
[18641.37s -> 18644.97s]  uh i could take a one of the worker outfits but not really necessary
[18645.69s -> 18654.34s]  at the moment at least any of the guards there's a security camera i don't have any fish
[18654.34s -> 18669.43s]  how am i supposed to do this oh thank god oh if that was a fish it would have happened
[18696.39s -> 18698.31s]  that's it you're mine

[19740.12s -> 19748.81s]  magnificent use of colors and form if the new piece catches my forceful nature like this

[19769.53s -> 19789.77s]  brushstrokes mr hosam i'm a busy man you're not painting are you having a heart attack
[19789.77s -> 19802.33s]  get on with it all right 47 let's see if the aim of our cashmereian friend is true
[19803.13s -> 19825.13s]  the word done already huh i told you it was close excellent yes yes look at those
[19825.21s -> 19832.01s]  cheekbones and my manly jaw you've captured everything beautifully i know i did a good
[19832.01s -> 19838.09s]  job thank you a modern masterpiece masterpiece you should feel honored to be allowed to
[19838.09s -> 19842.97s]  contribute to something like no he's gonna drink the champagne he's gonna drink champagne
[19842.97s -> 19850.17s]  kind words from a true connoisseur of the fine parts mr rangan oh that's so lame
[19852.65s -> 19860.73s]  oh my god is confirmed killed just one target left let's get out of here
[19861.77s -> 19876.02s]  just standing in the way i was thinking maybe he would shoot and would shoot through my head
[19883.10s -> 19887.53s]  all right let's see the way it's supposed to be played out all right 47
[19887.53s -> 19890.81s]  let's see if the aim of our cashmereian friend is true
[19892.23s -> 19898.07s]  once the word gets out and my art appreciating friends see it your phone will be ringing off
[19898.07s -> 19904.15s]  the hook i can't wait hold your breath for a moment mr rangan that's the reason i told
[19904.15s -> 19908.95s]  you i wouldn't pay for the commission by the way hold your breath stingy no no not at all
[19908.95s -> 19916.89s]  but if i'm already paying you in exposure let's not overdo it you know i prefer cash
[19919.21s -> 19925.05s]  clench your fist please clench your fist who doesn't but he's a pretty good painter exposure
[19925.05s -> 19935.26s]  can be worth more than just money look in this case it's the gift that keeps on giving
[19936.22s -> 19942.06s]  just wait and see when you're done with this job the contracts will be rolling in that
[19942.06s -> 19948.70s]  sounds wonderful mr rangan here it comes okay so look up a bit that shot came from the
[19948.70s -> 19954.70s]  tools it looks like the cashmere and finally got a clear line of fire okay darwood rangan is dead
[19955.26s -> 19961.74s]  just wait hold on a second maybe we had to activate that first i just want to check just
[19961.74s -> 19974.98s]  and i want to see i'm just curious i want to just see if i can get shot in the head
[19978.10s -> 19983.24s]  because if it if he have it activates right just wait and see hold on when you're done
[19983.24s -> 19988.25s]  with this job the tracks will be rolling in that sounds wonderful mr rangan
[19988.97s -> 20001.40s]  can you look up a bit damn it short earlier than that one second earlier i gotta literally
[20001.40s -> 20015.94s]  just put it down right when he says his last line here so i'm giving when you're done with
[20015.94s -> 20026.39s]  this job the contracts will be rolling in that sound i told you it was close excellent okay
[20026.47s -> 20040.36s]  so you can't you can't do it it stops the whole thing oh well worth a try the painter just does
[20040.36s -> 20050.25s]  it so i'm giving just wait and see no fun allowed i just want to see the contracts will
[20050.25s -> 20058.33s]  be rolling in that sounds wonderful mr rangan can you look up a bit that shot came from the

[20064.01s -> 20074.09s]  dead and not even by your hand 47 how long will you think next that's a great ending pose
[20074.97s -> 20104.89s]  nice work no just leave them leave them i'm done all right so here's the real question
[20106.66s -> 20116.73s]  where is the last bit of the barber in the maelstrom okay target already eliminated

[20265.78s -> 20271.38s]  industrial strength fan normally used for clearing smoke from construction tunnels
[20271.38s -> 20277.14s]  that's a beast of a machine 47 the crew have put some sort of limiter on the fan output

[20719.13s -> 20724.33s]  picking him out in a crowd should be possible you could also investigate the barbershop
[20724.33s -> 20730.10s]  and see what is going on there all right time to get out of here let me take a look at the photo

[22111.24s -> 22120.41s]  six is your name it's definitely larry all right so everybody the reason why we're gonna
[22120.49s -> 22131.34s]  shop here is because that was three areas just over six hours here so well so tomorrow by the
[22131.34s -> 22136.30s]  way tomorrow the green screen is not tomorrow the green screen is gonna be friday so tomorrow
[22136.94s -> 22143.90s]  we're gonna pick up exactly at this moment right here exactly halfway so if it's been
[22143.90s -> 22147.43s]  about you know we've been fucking around a little bit we've been doing some story missions
[22147.43s -> 22152.39s]  we figure six hours six hours six hours seven hours something like that at the halfway point
[22152.39s -> 22163.56s]  here so i will see you guys tomorrow probably around the same time around five to six p.m
[22163.56s -> 22170.82s]  eastern two three p.m maybe pacific the green screen is not tomorrow why not tomorrow
[22171.46s -> 22175.38s]  because i'd rather put it on friday where more people could probably watch
[22176.18s -> 22185.74s]  and with that thanks for sticking around i had a lot of fun this is this game as hilarious
[22185.74s -> 22192.71s]  and amazing as i expected it to be so it's just more of the if you liked hitman from a couple
[22192.71s -> 22198.86s]  years ago this just they just did more it's just more stuff it's just more missions and
[22199.58s -> 22210.87s]  more scenarios which is kind of what everybody wanted in the first place so it's good anyways
[22210.87s -> 22216.90s]  uh i'll see you guys soon see you tomorrow and i'm gonna hit the escape button then i'm
[22216.90s -> 22224.47s]  gonna exit the menu and then i'm gonna put up this thing and we'll do the bits
[22226.15s -> 22232.79s]  plus there's other things to do maybe maybe we'll do two more streams of this game i would
[22232.79s -> 22238.42s]  assume there's still lots to do so it's not like i'm gonna blow through all the story
[22238.42s -> 22242.66s]  missions and never do anything else so we'll do another we'll do probably three streams
[22242.66s -> 22245.86s]  at hitman tomorrow we'll complete the story missions we'll go through the areas
[22245.86s -> 22260.02s]  and after that we'll see but anyways let us go back to way earlier this evening have you taken
[22260.02s -> 22267.11s]  off see you soon and if you're sticking around hey thanks uh elizabeth thanks for the one dollar
[22267.11s -> 22273.53s]  well that was yesterday but thank you anyways uh thank you also to six hours ago here we go
[22273.53s -> 22281.30s]  uh uh zolnog thank you zolnog for the one zero zero zero the ten bucks
[22282.98s -> 22290.25s]  ten dollars here appreciated zol that was the first bit that came in peaceful hailey thanks
[22290.25s -> 22294.90s]  for the one dollar hey germa just want to say thanks uh say how much i love what you do
[22295.46s -> 22299.62s]  also but having trouble lately with job troubles like i don't have one right now
[22299.62s -> 22302.82s]  and i want to make a career out of voice acting and it's harder than i thought but
[22302.82s -> 22307.94s]  it's what i love and i also love what you do i really hope i can be successful i keep having
[22307.94s -> 22312.58s]  doubts about it just because i feel pathetic not having a shitty part-time job right now hope i
[22312.58s -> 22321.32s]  can do what i've always wanted to do thanks my best advice i can give you is always have
[22322.49s -> 22327.50s]  always have two or three things you're interested in that you like that you care
[22327.50s -> 22333.18s]  about so you have things that you're always cool doing you know what i mean have like
[22333.26s -> 22337.90s]  at least two or three passions things that you really love so then if one works out and the
[22337.90s -> 22344.92s]  other two don't then you're still doing something that you really like to do right uh voice acting
[22344.92s -> 22351.62s]  is it's a tough gig it's a hard business to get into it's um i've been kind of out of it
[22351.62s -> 22358.76s]  for a long time but the best resource is available for you you just have to kind of
[22358.84s -> 22366.04s]  work on a demo get out there be try to uh put yourself into online cartoons try to audition for
[22366.04s -> 22373.46s]  online cartoons they still do them that's what i did and make sure you have three things that
[22373.46s -> 22378.28s]  you like to do because you'll never be disappointed like i think a lot of times people just
[22379.08s -> 22384.60s]  have the one thing that they want to do one thing and they go for it go for it go for
[22384.60s -> 22388.28s]  it go for it and if it doesn't work out it's like oh well fuck man it didn't work out but
[22388.28s -> 22393.02s]  if you still have other things that you know that you like you won't feel that way
[22395.03s -> 22401.51s]  i knew i i here's the three things that i've always always wanted to do one uh i love
[22401.51s -> 22405.75s]  computers i've always wanted to be somewhere in the field of computers whether it's with
[22405.75s -> 22410.63s]  customer support with com with uh you know computer software or and this is by the way
[22410.63s -> 22415.11s]  this is before um even like i started college so i would have obviously done more
[22415.11s -> 22422.71s]  into this if i did uh love computers love animals i volunteered at an animal shelter free like
[22422.71s -> 22427.19s]  just over a year just maybe it was like 11 months 12 months or something i really wanted
[22427.19s -> 22432.31s]  to work with animals because i fucking love animals i love dogs uh like a veterinary vet
[22432.31s -> 22435.59s]  tech or something like that is something that i always like i would be completely fine with
[22435.59s -> 22441.83s]  doing you know what i mean uh then there was like voice acting and videos and big comedies
[22441.83s -> 22445.91s]  shit you know what i mean like that was another thing try to spread out your passions
[22446.71s -> 22456.92s]  that way you're never disappointed your computer breaks every other stream you made the right
[22456.92s -> 22462.52s]  choice not going into it well but that's what i mean like but that's something i wanted to do
[22463.40s -> 22472.62s]  if just because like my computer breaks doesn't mean i what is that even components break my
[22472.62s -> 22479.46s]  ram died a stick of ram died that's not because i like peed on it but that's really
[22479.46s -> 22485.02s]  the best advice i can give i wish you the best of luck hopefully you end up doing something
[22485.02s -> 22493.72s]  that you like to do good luck to you uh div usp thanks for the three bucks no message thank you
[22494.36s -> 22501.26s]  for the three dollars uh after smath thanks to the one dollar hey germa i can't wait to

[22573.30s -> 22578.46s]  it just it's everything that i want in a video game the only thing it does not have
[22579.26s -> 22585.74s]  is cars if you could drive around and hitman actually just commandeer vehicles and drive
[22585.74s -> 22591.90s]  around and it was like an actual like open open world game with vehicles i don't think you would
[22591.90s -> 22596.62s]  ever make another video game that i would ever play ever again that's the only game i would
[22596.62s -> 22607.37s]  play i would only play that game it would go up a letter grade to to an s spider-man is was

[23233.29s -> 23240.41s]  let the credits scroll on by of all the subs and resubs they should be making their way by
[23240.41s -> 23247.24s]  right now what's tomorrow more hitman we got halfway through so we're gonna go from the
[23247.24s -> 23254.09s]  halfway point probably to the end and see where we are after that because then the day after
[23254.09s -> 23260.70s]  that is green screen unless anything major happens which i don't think it will if there's
[23260.70s -> 23265.34s]  some kind of technical problem where i have to push it to saturday i don't think i will though
[23265.34s -> 23275.74s]  i think it's pretty locked in that it's gonna happen friday have you been following the
[23275.74s -> 23286.63s]  hitman 2 story yes i guess a little a little make it a star wars scroll what do i think of
[23286.63s -> 23300.34s]  hitman 2 so far i think it's great i think it is summarize it uh so last game the bad guy
[23301.78s -> 23311.94s]  was actually your uh like a shared of bunk beds with you and you're both subjects of
[23311.94s -> 23320.30s]  assassin of an assassin program and diana um diana's uh that way i don't know what spoiler
[23320.30s -> 23328.52s]  but diana had an issue something happened to diana when she was younger that's it that's all
[23328.52s -> 23340.52s]  i know well yeah pretty much you got two opposing forces you know you got a red and a blue
[23341.24s -> 23344.52s]  and you know that there's a thing this entity that this it's a big circle
[23348.23s -> 23353.27s]  spoiler now i know something happens with diana's in every single one of these games
[23354.23s -> 23370.74s]  they're in every she's in every game spark notes for hitman 2 but for real thank you all you guys
[23370.74s -> 23386.55s]  here all the resubs all the new subs spoilers we know she's in the game uh except for most of
[23386.55s -> 23391.66s]  absolution we don't talk about absolution absolution really is such a weird game
[23392.46s -> 23401.38s]  because it sits right in the middle of absolute perfection of video games you know what i mean
[23402.02s -> 23408.10s]  you've got like the first few hitmans were just you know genre defining pieces of video game
[23408.10s -> 23417.14s]  media right and then you have absolution which was just what the hell is this it was like
[23417.14s -> 23420.90s]  good but it was like an action game it was it was kind of linear and then you got like
[23420.90s -> 23429.70s]  these two which are fucking fantastic absolution is a vine game but it's just
[23429.70s -> 23435.06s]  like it just doesn't it just sits right in the middle in a weird place in hitman
[23435.86s -> 23452.42s]  lore and hitman gameplay because the thing that predate it and i think that succeeds it
[23453.14s -> 23459.34s]  is just so much better it's just odd but i will see you tomorrow we will talk more about hitman
[23459.34s -> 23467.37s]  because we're gonna play it again tomorrow is absolution a good starting game no i think you
[23467.37s -> 23471.13s]  should only play absolution if you really really love hitman and it's one of your
[23471.13s -> 23478.17s]  favorite franchises if you want to start somewhere it's just i mean it's just hard
[23478.17s -> 23491.13s]  at the just start at the first hitman from 2016 you'll get it or hitman 2 i would just
[23491.13s -> 23499.14s]  start with the one that came out in 2016 blood money is the best one so far or the best one
[23499.14s -> 23505.54s]  in that originals yeah it is but i would just start with just get a good taste of it start
[23505.54s -> 23520.81s]  with the best you can play blood money on browser that's kind of weird but with that
[23521.53s -> 23528.97s]  see you all tomorrow have a great rest of your night take care sleep well goodbye
