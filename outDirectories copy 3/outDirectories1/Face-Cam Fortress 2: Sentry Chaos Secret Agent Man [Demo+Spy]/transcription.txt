[0.31s -> 13.67s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Mondays edition.
[13.67s -> 21.65s]  Playing as the Demoman. Hold on. Needed to kill somebody.
[21.65s -> 30.19s]  Playing as the Demoman on King of the Hill Badlands. This place is bad. Bad, bad, bad.
[30.19s -> 34.19s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, okay. Don't freak out here. It's just a sentry.
[34.19s -> 50.04s]  And it's gone. Oh, oh, oh my god. Thank you, my goodness. That was... What the hell is going on?
[50.04s -> 65.33s]  Oh my god. I'm speechless right now. There was just three big sentries, I think. One up there, one down, and one to the right.
[65.33s -> 80.20s]  Holy crap. That jar lag. Wow. Oh my god. Okay, good to know. Good to know. We're getting beat. Help me.
[80.20s -> 90.78s]  Oh man, I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna burn out. This is gonna be a sad death. Where's the health?
[90.78s -> 104.09s]  I'll thank every single god that exists for this medic. Get that guy. Where is this sentry now?
[104.09s -> 117.42s]  Is it still over here? It's right there. That thing's going away right now. See you later, sentry.
[117.42s -> 123.73s]  Another one. You guys are relentless with the sentry guns. At least I got the point.
[123.73s -> 127.86s]  Oh, by the way, everyone was telling me in the last couple videos, they said,
[127.86s -> 133.86s]  Jerma, your room is an absolute mess. So I do agree with you, so I'm gonna clean it for you right now.
[133.86s -> 150.14s]  Just a pair of scissors. We don't need those. Let's see. Some kind of disc. This is an expensive camera.
[150.14s -> 157.62s]  Oh! You see, I just made somebody gasp. Somebody just went, Jerma! Okay, we just lost.
[157.62s -> 162.67s]  You know what happens when you lose? You do it again, and you win this time.
[162.67s -> 177.29s]  Should I stay, Demoman? That's the real question. Hmm. How many Demo- What do we have? I'm staying. We only have one. It's me.
[177.29s -> 183.19s]  Hiya, where ya doin'? Oh, I'm gonna take that sentry out!
[183.19s -> 191.51s]  Alright, let's actually win this time. Gotta get a victory under our belts. Come on, dudes.
[191.51s -> 200.83s]  How did I miss you? You slippery bastard! Oh my- Get the hell over here!
[200.83s -> 209.10s]  Somebody, you know what? Someone's getting crushed with this. I'm going to crush someone.
[209.10s -> 214.10s]  I'm mad right now. I'm mad. Bro.
[214.10s -> 217.10s]  Wow, this is- I can't believe I'm actually still standing here.
[217.10s -> 223.86s]  Not this time! Alright, at least I got the point. At least we got the point.
[223.86s -> 230.94s]  Oh, this engineer. No, let me kill him! I need to get the kill! No!
[230.94s -> 237.78s]  God, okay. Oh, and welcome to FaceCamp Fortress 2, where Jerma runs around in circles with the-
[237.78s -> 242.86s]  Okay, there we go. Good, good, good. Good. Get that kill.
[242.86s -> 249.94s]  That engineer's not gonna build anything in that room. Not while I'm on my watch.
[249.94s -> 254.24s]  I try to say, not on my watch, and I say, not while I'm on my watch.
[254.24s -> 260.94s]  Not exactly sure what those words would mean together. That was actually like a literal phrase.
[260.94s -> 264.69s]  Not while I'm on my watch. Oh, you bastard.
[264.69s -> 271.51s]  Finally. I landed a shot on somebody.
[271.51s -> 278.15s]  Ugh! Alrighty. Get outta here.
[278.15s -> 282.71s]  Let's get a long range shot right there. That would've been sick. Too bad I didn't get it.
[282.71s -> 289.41s]  Oh! Baby!
[289.41s -> 295.57s]  Come on, somebody stumble outta there. Somebody stumble on outta there.
[295.57s -> 305.17s]  Oh, that's how you smash!
[305.17s -> 309.90s]  That guy turned the corner and just got absolutely decimated.
[309.90s -> 315.96s]  Oh, that's one way to lose.
[315.96s -> 319.33s]  Anything up here? No. Spy, though.
[319.33s -> 323.17s]  Perfect opportunity right here for one of these.
[323.17s -> 328.06s]  Oh, never mind!
[328.06s -> 330.06s]  Everything in that room is going down right now.
[330.06s -> 336.23s]  I'm just going to lob stickies into that window and just absolutely kill everything.
[336.23s -> 340.90s]  You ready? Are you ready for this? I hope you're ready for this.
[340.90s -> 348.48s]  Oh, that medic is a brave soul. What a brave bastard.
[348.48s -> 352.48s]  Swinging away with his bone saw. In a room full of people and a sentry.
[352.48s -> 356.48s]  I commend you, good sir. But you, on the other hand, whatever.
[356.48s -> 361.68s]  You know what? He can keep his pride. It's time to destroy everything in that room.
[361.68s -> 371.09s]  Oh, I got one guy. Oh, come on. Get in that room. Get in that room.
[371.09s -> 374.26s]  Oh, there it is. Sentry down.
[374.26s -> 379.34s]  And big heavy up. Big heavy dead.
[379.34s -> 383.86s]  Anything else in this room that I should be aware of? Yes, there is.
[383.86s -> 387.86s]  Anything else I should be aware of here? Look at all this carnage.
[387.86s -> 392.22s]  I wonder what happened in there.
[392.22s -> 396.63s]  Keep him closed off. Keep him closed off.
[396.63s -> 400.07s]  Yeah! That's going to be it.
[400.07s -> 402.44s]  Cool. Top rack.
[402.44s -> 405.44s]  13 points as a demo, man. Blink.
[405.44s -> 407.44s]  I promise I'm not going to kill you. I promise.
[407.44s -> 411.06s]  Oh, you walked away from one taunt kill into another one.
[411.06s -> 415.44s]  But I didn't get it.
[415.44s -> 418.44s]  Alright, we'll do one more life and then I'm going to close it up.
[418.44s -> 421.00s]  One more life as a spy.
[421.00s -> 424.56s]  And what we're going to do here is actually very, very important.
[424.56s -> 427.93s]  Alright? I'm going to try to not kill anybody.
[427.93s -> 429.93s]  I just want to blend in.
[429.93s -> 433.23s]  I just want to be on blue team. That's all I want.
[433.23s -> 435.60s]  But first I want to kill this medic.
[435.60s -> 436.60s]  Okay, now I want to just blend in.
[436.60s -> 438.74s]  Alright, here we go. Ready?
[438.74s -> 441.36s]  Not going to try not to kill anybody.
[441.36s -> 443.86s]  Just want to pretend that I'm on blue team.
[443.86s -> 447.67s]  Alright, guys. We got to get on that point.
[447.67s -> 451.30s]  Alright, yeah. We got it. Sweet deal. Awesome, dudes.
[451.30s -> 454.24s]  Alright, we got to cap this. Come on, guys.
[454.24s -> 455.93s]  Cap it.
[455.93s -> 458.74s]  Alright, nice job, you guys. We did a good job here.
[458.74s -> 460.74s]  I commend both of you guys.
[460.74s -> 462.92s]  Got to get that sentry up, man.
[462.92s -> 465.92s]  I don't want to get backstabbed by any spies because I'm a sniper, you know.
[465.92s -> 467.48s]  Aw, I got to snipe.
[467.48s -> 469.94s]  Get that stuff up.
[469.94s -> 472.56s]  Come on, let me zoom in here.
[472.56s -> 473.56s]  Got to be careful.
[473.56s -> 475.99s]  All kinds of things can happen right now.
[475.99s -> 478.55s]  You know, this guy...
[478.55s -> 479.73s]  If I...
[479.73s -> 481.35s]  You know what?
[481.35s -> 483.66s]  I'll see you guys all next time.
[483.66s -> 484.66s]  Of course.
[484.66s -> 485.66s]  And...
[497.29s -> 499.29s]  Oh, well.
[499.29s -> 501.29s]  I was going to end it by...
[501.29s -> 502.29s]  That was funny.
[502.29s -> 505.91s]  But you know what? I guess I'll end it from right this.
[505.91s -> 506.91s]  From right this, yeah.
[506.91s -> 507.91s]  One.
[507.91s -> 508.91s]  And...
[509.91s -> 510.91s]  Two.
[510.91s -> 511.91s]  And...
[511.91s -> 512.91s]  Three.
[512.91s -> 515.41s]  Come on. Who wants to kill me?
[515.41s -> 517.29s]  Somebody kill me.
[517.29s -> 518.29s]  Somebody please kill me.
[518.29s -> 522.79s]  Oh my god.
[526.40s -> 527.40s]  You got me.
[528.40s -> 529.70s]  Alright, guys.
[529.70s -> 530.70s]  That's going to be it.
[530.70s -> 531.70s]  I will see you guys all next time.
[531.70s -> 534.70s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[534.70s -> 535.70s]  Time to clean my room.
[535.70s -> 536.88s]  Let's go.
