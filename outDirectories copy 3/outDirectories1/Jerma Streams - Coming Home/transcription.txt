[5.88s -> 14.47s]  I told you guys I was gonna be early. I told you. I mean, I'm only five minutes early,
[14.47s -> 27.18s]  but I'm still early. Still counts. Well does. How you doing? Are we doing good?
[27.82s -> 42.55s]  I gotta tweet this. Today, we're gonna play some FMV games. One just came out that piqued my
[42.55s -> 54.30s]  interest. If we're gonna play the first one is not late. No, I'm not late. I'm precisely on
[54.30s -> 66.33s]  time. The first one is called American Hero and apparently this game is like 25 years old
[67.61s -> 76.94s]  and it was never released. So some company, I guess they like got 90% of the way through
[76.94s -> 82.92s]  development and they just didn't finish the game. So some random indie company, I don't
[84.28s -> 89.16s]  see what the name of the company is. I kind of forget. Got all the footage
[90.12s -> 98.38s]  and actually released it. So this is a very old game. I'm very interested in this one.
[98.38s -> 107.37s]  You're a hipster king. Well, not really. This thing's on the Nintendo Switch right now.
[107.37s -> 118.01s]  So not really. I didn't like go get this on some secret place. You can literally get this
[118.01s -> 130.42s]  on Switch right now. What about Monster Breeder? It's possible we play Monster Breeder later
[131.72s -> 137.54s]  today. It really depends on how long these take. Because with some FMV games, some of these games
[137.54s -> 144.14s]  are 40 minutes. Some of them are three hours. It really depends on how many. Maybe if we play
[144.14s -> 150.30s]  through it again, if we move on to the next one, I don't know. It depends. We'll see.
[150.94s -> 165.02s]  We can play among us. It's never gonna happen. It's gonna be awful or bad.
[168.06s -> 176.01s]  Is that what you said? Did I read that wrong? This is gonna be awful or bad. What about the
[176.01s -> 181.69s]  Goosebumps FMV with Jeff Goldblum? I did not even know that existed. But now that I know that
[181.69s -> 188.86s]  exists, I'm very interested. I'm like an FMV wine connoisseur. It doesn't matter how bad they are.
[188.86s -> 201.30s]  It doesn't matter how shitty they are. I have to play them. All of them, if I can. Also,
[201.30s -> 206.84s]  I want to make this really clear. There was a content warning on this game. Apparently,
[206.84s -> 212.68s]  it's pretty dated. I don't know exactly what that means. But like I said, it's on the
[212.68s -> 224.06s]  Switch. I don't exactly know what to be looking for. But we'll be on the ready.
[224.70s -> 241.05s]  Are you gonna stream bad mojo? Probably not. So if we do come across something that's
[241.05s -> 247.99s]  fucking shitty and bad, you know, you fucking behave yourselves. Come on. Come on, Gwen.
[247.99s -> 266.82s]  You know what I mean? Are you gonna stream crab game? No, I don't. Every one of these
[266.82s -> 275.69s]  games it takes off. I don't play them. I watch. Okay, this with like trends on Twitch.
[276.65s -> 281.37s]  It's kind of like how a lot of people jump into like the stock market and stuff.
[282.33s -> 286.41s]  It's like a game will come along and I'll go that looks kind of cool. I would like to
[286.41s -> 291.61s]  maybe try that out. That looks like a great experience. And then I don't play it. And then
[291.61s -> 297.61s]  two or three weeks later, it's it's incredibly popular and everyone's on it. Oh, that's
[297.61s -> 301.21s]  awesome. I probably should have maybe I could get in now. I don't think I'm gonna get it. I
[301.21s -> 305.45s]  you know, maybe it looks fun. Now it's like the biggest thing on Twitch, the biggest the
[305.45s -> 310.41s]  biggest thing in the world. I don't want to buy the top of the crab game meta.
[311.13s -> 316.31s]  You know what I mean? Stop calling me a hipster. Why are you saying that?
[325.00s -> 328.76s]  Why don't you stream McDonald's hamburger adventure? I don't even know what you're
[328.76s -> 338.76s]  talking about. All right, you guys ready? Apparently this is something else I read about
[338.76s -> 347.69s]  this too is the actor that's in this. They had to have him rerecord lines with the restoration.
[348.92s -> 355.16s]  And I mean, the guy's like almost 25 plus years older than he is. So I don't know how
[355.16s -> 365.38s]  that's gonna play out. But it might be pretty funny. But this is American hero. I am ready.
[366.34s -> 372.52s]  Our choices matter apparently. Are you gonna play Fortnite or should I just go?
[373.75s -> 380.62s]  You liar. Euro how many months up? You're a six month subscriber. You've been here for six months.
[381.64s -> 384.92s]  You know what happens on this channel. You're a liar. You're lying to everybody.
[385.48s -> 397.66s]  All right, you ready? Let's go. This is American hero. Viewer discretion is advised apparently.
[400.10s -> 410.62s]  And let's go. You ready? Oh, by the way, very important. That's the guy from That's My Bush
[410.62s -> 416.09s]  from Comedy Central. Yeah, I don't know if anyone remembers that show.
[422.92s -> 431.24s]  That was a really weird reference. But here we go. American hero. Yeah, okay. Well,
[431.96s -> 441.27s]  this right off the bat, right off the bat. I hope this I don't think there's any nudity.
[441.27s -> 457.03s]  I hope not. No, there's not. Oh, God. My home away from home. It's I crystals looking
[457.03s -> 461.43s]  good today. I think that's the I think that's the voiceover. I think that's a new line.
[463.75s -> 471.29s]  Relax. Just care. Asshole. There is nudity. No, there's not. It's on the switch. It can't be.
[472.09s -> 476.41s]  It's on the Nintendo Switch. It's impossible. They don't allow any nudity on the switch.
[476.41s -> 488.97s]  That's a lie. It can't be possible. Here's trouble. They were right. Now you can piss
[488.97s -> 496.31s]  off Sergeant. It's Colonel. BFD. The old man has a problem. Why does it sound like he's
[496.31s -> 505.29s]  in a bathroom? Not interested. It involves Laura in a dangerous mind control virus.
[505.29s -> 512.49s]  Dangerous. Okay. I think she's been kidnapped. Can't say more.
[512.49s -> 516.25s]  It looks like Borderlands characters. It looks weird. Why? You're interested.
[516.89s -> 524.81s]  Meet me somewhere a little more private. You're a big fucking dork. All right,
[524.81s -> 527.53s]  let me pay attention to the game. A rock in a hard place.
[531.06s -> 538.78s]  I have to make a decision here. What do I want to do? Bad news. Bad news or party?
[539.34s -> 544.70s]  Party. What? Bad news. What's going on? What do I do?
[551.74s -> 561.75s]  Did he leave? Oh shit. Am I going to get run over by a car? Why is there a truck?
[562.63s -> 577.21s]  Do I have to move the QTE? What do I do? What do I do?
[577.21s -> 583.13s]  A ledge. Run. A ledge. Run. A ledge. Run. Run.
[591.62s -> 596.26s]  Jump. I'm going to jump. I'm going to drop. I'm going to drop. He's going to get run over.
[601.30s -> 606.12s]  New item unlocked? Oh shit.
[620.81s -> 631.26s]  Wait, hold on a second. Hold on. So I was in a strip club and then I was either going to
[631.26s -> 634.62s]  go do this mission or stay in the strip club. And then he left the strip club,
[634.78s -> 643.46s]  running away from a somebody in a Mack truck that ran my whole body over lengthwise,
[643.46s -> 650.41s]  which is fucking crazy. I got steamrolled. Okay. All right. No, Jesus. We have to do this
[650.41s -> 657.45s]  again. I don't want to have to show this again. All right. What should I do? Should I?
[658.09s -> 661.85s]  I'm going to go get the bad news. I'm not clicking party on a game that has been
[661.85s -> 666.41s]  confirmed to have nudity in it. No way. Not going to happen. Nope. Not happening.
[667.37s -> 675.99s]  My home away from home. I could run up a lengthwise. That's fucking it ran up from
[675.99s -> 682.06s]  my heels. Looking good today. To the top of my head. That was insane. Hey, Sherlock,
[682.06s -> 689.80s]  you got something against me making a living? Relax. Pinhead. I missed that last time as
[689.80s -> 700.79s]  well. He's drinking carrot juice. I don't get it. I don't believe there's nudity on
[700.79s -> 709.66s]  the switch. Here's trouble. They were right. So now you can piss off. Oh, there's not.
[710.30s -> 719.13s]  It's Colonel. BFD. The old man has a problem. I'm not clicking party. I'm not interested.
[719.13s -> 733.70s]  Involves Laura in a dangerous mind control virus. I didn't mean to click that. I think
[733.70s -> 739.45s]  she's been kidnapped. Can't say more. It's upscaled with AI. You're interested.
[741.61s -> 744.65s]  It does actually. I'm actually kind of glad it looks like this because some of the old
[744.65s -> 749.05s]  FMV games we've played in the past, they look like absolute dog shit. So this
[749.05s -> 755.45s]  doesn't really even look that bad. All right. No, no party. No, I have to get this right.
[755.45s -> 766.02s]  It's like a rhythm game. Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. I clicked bad news.
[767.40s -> 773.96s]  I clicked bad news. I don't want to run away from the fucking truck. I clicked bad news.
[774.76s -> 780.90s]  I clicked. What the fuck? No, I'm. How do I skip the cut scene?
[784.25s -> 789.85s]  I'm not going to get run over again. The truck is bad news. Oh, no, it's not. I didn't do
[789.85s -> 796.04s]  anything last time. All right. All right. This time don't drop. This time I'm going to,
[796.60s -> 808.31s]  I'm going to go for the ledge. Ledge. Ledge. Run. Ledge. Run. Ledge. Ledge. Run. Is he doing it?
[809.03s -> 818.07s]  What? He's not making decisions. What the fuck? Drop. Jump. Drop. I can't do anything.
[818.07s -> 836.60s]  Do you hear me clicking? Do you hear this? Why doesn't the game work? Mouse one. I'm clicking
[836.60s -> 851.53s]  mouse one. Oh, this is not good. It's not right click. It's left click, right? Maybe I
[851.53s -> 858.41s]  should unplug the controller. I don't think I have one and plugged in. I mean, the mouse
[858.41s -> 864.30s]  apps. Yeah, that's left click. I don't think. No, there's no controller plugged in.
[864.30s -> 876.84s]  It's just my mouse. I was spamming too. 10 second reaction time. Try right clicking. Hold on.
[877.40s -> 890.18s]  Options. Dirty full screen. Set keys. Set. OK, select left click, right? Yeah. Action space.
[891.54s -> 905.54s]  There'll be pressing. Well, why would it say left click? I guess I'm going to try to hit
[905.54s -> 913.98s]  space. It's also up, down, left, right as well. Well, I'll try space. God damn it.
[916.79s -> 922.07s]  All right, I'll try space. You better believe I'm going to try to make sure this get this to
[922.07s -> 926.79s]  work. You don't get run over lengthwise by a car like that and not like play out at least
[926.79s -> 935.34s]  some of the game. You kidding me? No way. All right, let me see what happens. The tutorial
[935.34s -> 940.46s]  doesn't give you it just tells you like the gist of the game. I read it already. All
[940.46s -> 948.20s]  right. Can I skip this cut scene? How do you skip cut scene? Escape. There's definitely a way
[948.20s -> 962.38s]  to do it. Enter. I mean, it tab works. My home away from home. Right click. No,
[962.38s -> 970.97s]  that's definitely a way to do it. Looking good today. I'm going to see if space works.
[974.12s -> 977.40s]  Pinhead. Are you making us watch this? I'm not making you watch this again.
[978.82s -> 995.24s]  I'm trying the game's controls are not accurate. Here's trouble. They were right.
[995.40s -> 1003.19s]  Now you can piss off. Sergeant. It's Colonel. BFD. The old man has a problem.
[1003.19s -> 1009.27s]  He needs your help. Not interested. Bad news space. It involves law. It doesn't work that
[1009.27s -> 1015.91s]  I don't know what I'm going to do. It's not the game. Oh, should I like? Should
[1015.91s -> 1022.06s]  I plug it to controller in? I think she's been kidnapped. Can't say more walls have ears.
[1022.86s -> 1026.06s]  If you're interested, meet me somewhere a little more private.
[1026.06s -> 1044.25s]  And let's see. Base rock in a hard place. Come on, please work. Please work. Bad news.
[1045.29s -> 1055.78s]  Space. It's fucking space. What is that meter at the top? I know you'd make the right
[1055.78s -> 1061.62s]  choice. Okay, Colonel, this better be good. I hope I still get run over by a fucking truck.
[1064.63s -> 1070.36s]  I'm sure Laura would be impressed. I'm not here on a social visit.
[1070.52s -> 1075.80s]  So many cigarettes. Kruger's escaped. It's up to his old tricks. Laura was working for us.
[1075.80s -> 1081.32s]  She developed an antivirus formula that kidnapped her before she could get it to us.
[1081.32s -> 1086.12s]  Tell me about the virus. The old man will do that. What matters is you want Laura.
[1086.76s -> 1093.22s]  We want the antivirus formula. Okay. No, that's not. That's not Nick Cage.
[1093.70s -> 1100.87s]  Jack, can you get it up for another? Fuck you. Yes. Fuck you. Yes.
[1105.21s -> 1106.25s]  I just blacked out.
[1110.25s -> 1113.29s]  Why did I black out? What was the point of blacking out?
[1116.63s -> 1123.75s]  Oh, it's sensor. Get it. Split. Lemon. Get it. Lemon. No, no, no, no, no, no.

[1574.66s -> 1580.16s]  story time with a kid late at night
[1580.16s -> 1585.40s]  random acts of violent from single murders to full-scale riots we don't
[1585.40s -> 1589.04s]  know how cook was spreading the damn thing we heard that he's working on a
[1589.04s -> 1595.96s]  sophisticated delivery system which will release a virus everywhere
[1595.96s -> 1601.36s]  it's a raid hold up the only man for this one Jack but for God's sake then

[1619.55s -> 1623.03s]  gonna give you a very very quick warning we're playing a game that's got
[1623.03s -> 1629.43s]  some pretty fucked up themes I guess it's an old FMV game it just released
[1629.43s -> 1634.20s]  it's on the Nintendo switch though it's on the switch therefore you know
[1634.20s -> 1636.32s]  I don't think they'd be very much nudity or anything like that just
[1636.32s -> 1642.03s]  know that is on the switch but I'll welcome everybody thanks a lot for

[2182.56s -> 2192.80s]  decisions probably break I yeah okay what if I hit gas here's what the
[2192.80s -> 2203.60s]  other option this game is having a nightmare it is
[2203.60s -> 2234.32s]  kind of having a nightmare it's break break is the right play we're gonna get
[2234.32s -> 2258.96s]  the same ending it's my lucky day this is the outrageous is brave the way Jack
[2258.96s -> 2265.96s]  would watch it be ashes to ashes dust to dust what was the budget for this
[2265.96s -> 2269.40s]  game I don't know but the crazy story about this game is that you weren't
[2269.40s -> 2276.68s]  here in the very beginning this game was never released it it was done
[2276.68s -> 2280.08s]  filming and I don't know if they ran the studio ran out of money or something
[2280.08s -> 2284.08s]  but it was never actually released a new company came in and kind of
[2284.08s -> 2288.12s]  remastered all the footage and restored it it's the only reason why
[2288.12s -> 2305.58s]  we're playing it today okay it's great great oh it's just was in a Jaguar
[2305.58s -> 2326.29s]  right we're not arguing about McDonald's or Wendy's we're talking
[2326.29s -> 2348.12s]  about life and death here there we go okay we're good on to the next sequence
[2348.12s -> 2368.25s]  what are you waiting for let's go okay what is this pretty tight security

[2461.96s -> 2468.80s]  it was a rubber hand I will release my virus into the system within minutes
[2468.80s -> 2476.89s]  the disease will ripple out exponent it will be the greatest biological
[2476.89s -> 2486.70s]  conquest of all boys in the water oh that's why they're drinking the water
[2486.70s -> 2497.56s]  out of the big bottles a new order shall prevail my another failed attempt
[2497.56s -> 2519.28s]  oh sadistic bastard I got ready to turn and fight put him with a good dog oh
[2519.28s -> 2531.26s]  no I'm gonna get like tortured what information do I have anyways I'm
[2531.26s -> 2554.33s]  just like an agent that's Laura if it's a story recap so far I was in
[2554.33s -> 2558.45s]  retirement I came out of retirement to solve this madman poisoning the water
[2558.45s -> 2583.41s]  supply done already on my case what oh no they took away the light that
[2583.41s -> 2587.53s]  bulb is so expensive that's very okay we're gonna take the solution here

[2597.65s -> 2618.16s]  medical salt I'm sick I have diarrhea what something anti-virus formula has
[2618.16s -> 2624.92s]  an error yeah yeah he's gonna get crushed what would you open the door
[2624.92s -> 2629.68s]  without like a weapon yeah I was in the middle of pressing the squish
[2630.00s -> 2636.00s]  what do you want we're gonna help you with oh yeah they told me never to do
[2636.00s -> 2639.48s]  one thing I forget what it was I think it was don't ever open this fucking door
[2639.48s -> 2650.72s]  when people are in it that wasn't even cartoon logic that was like they had a
[2650.72s -> 2654.20s]  whole scene and like they had like that the scene they threw the whole
[2654.20s -> 2656.96s]  scene away and they had to get an extra to be that guy like there was
[2656.96s -> 2661.68s]  like a full ten minutes of dialogue there left right left that was a
[2661.68s -> 2671.52s]  reshoot left right they had a whole sequence with a guard oh shit they went
[2671.52s -> 2707.83s]  left oh god oh here we go oh no don't push her into the way sound effect if
[2707.83s -> 2710.55s]  you type in punch sound effect on YouTube right now that's the first
[2710.55s -> 2718.62s]  that's exactly the first one I have not had a decision to make they're
[2718.62s -> 2724.23s]  just doing it on their own the AI is just picking direction left right
[2724.23s -> 2737.87s]  left right right that'll do holy shit she's running way faster than me and
[2737.87s -> 2748.17s]  she's in heels that's crazy left right oh my god I have no idea
[2748.17s -> 2767.98s]  let's go left right was the same guy this guy again we're gonna okay we're
[2767.98s -> 2773.07s]  gonna see this guy again I that's the wrong way I think if you make the
[2773.07s -> 2776.99s]  wrong decision you go in a circle you see that guy every time we're
[2776.99s -> 2800.68s]  gonna see him again um right left right right that'll do we're about to
[2800.68s -> 2810.96s]  loop again is that guy gonna get up again not just shoot that guy left
[2810.96s -> 2833.10s]  right not again all right there's no way that guy comes back another time
[2833.10s -> 2839.16s]  it's not possible you understand it's not possible that guy's back he flew
[2839.16s -> 2851.80s]  off of a balcony like 15 feet no way I need to know right I have no that guy's
[2851.80s -> 2872.40s]  still alive somebody's watching these cameras just going oh he doesn't they
[2872.40s -> 2881.56s]  don't know he's back again no more running why is that you see single
[2881.56s -> 2901.01s]  shots there's two there now okay oh no we just we got an we got the end card
[2901.01s -> 2911.90s]  shit no ah damn it all right well we'll get it we'll get it this time
[2911.90s -> 2932.22s]  Oh auto bolt action Uzi okay well this is this game is insane I we have to
[2932.22s -> 2938.38s]  get at least some kind of other ending and having far too much fun to
[2938.98s -> 2952.75s]  let's go again let's try a new route let's go wait unlockable find every way
[2952.75s -> 2957.47s]  to end the game at Jack's funeral reach all the endings where Jack
[2957.47s -> 2964.14s]  survives I find stuff flatlined like a pancake by 18 wheels of steel oh these
[2964.14s -> 2971.30s]  are all the choices all right let's go oh we can start from here sadistic
[2971.30s -> 2979.70s]  bastard what wait what what happened where's Laura this didn't happen
[2979.70s -> 3005.68s]  should to me and you'll never see this didn't kill him later you still have
[3005.68s -> 3041.10s]  the gun shoot him in the face you have the gun you still have the gun alright I
[3041.10s -> 3053.30s]  should just try start the whole thing over see if we can get to the end from
[3053.30s -> 3060.14s]  here well what I didn't do that before I didn't punch the guy and grab the
[3060.14s -> 3069.91s]  gun last time all right what do you think ones in the chat to just go from
[3069.91s -> 3072.59s]  that checkpoint and try it to keep going or two in the chat if you want me
[3072.59s -> 3082.56s]  to start the game over and go different route that looks pretty that
[3082.56s -> 3088.78s]  looks pretty unanimously one all right let's go sadistic bastard okay so
[3088.78s -> 3094.81s]  this time I'm not gonna shoot grab the gun apparently where's Laura
[3095.74s -> 3118.90s]  okay don't shoot kill him later kill him later later they still so what I
[3118.90s -> 3132.94s]  don't I just don't care about having the weapon bar is a fight or flight
[3132.94s -> 3135.78s]  meter yeah the more it's on the right side it's aggression the more it's on
[3135.78s -> 3140.73s]  the left running right we have to do this again I need to play through this
[3140.73s -> 3153.54s]  game one more time at least it's too ridiculous not see everything else try

[3838.31s -> 3842.73s]  really bad one to have to redo it's been people walking around setting up
[3842.73s -> 3852.41s]  for like five straight minutes Krueger Hoover
[3852.41s -> 3856.13s]  Krueger Hoover drums

[3937.29s -> 3948.92s]  be another one of dr. Krueger's mindless on me a few seconds you'll be
[3948.92s -> 3954.85s]  my own personal can you say that again a plane drove over ruined your
[3954.85s -> 3978.84s]  moment exothermic reaction is gonna multiply that virus all right three
[3978.84s -> 3989.32s]  minutes take it away didn't he say a few seconds that turned into a few
[3989.36s -> 4000.21s]  minutes right this is the lose did I lose within three minutes Los Angeles
[4000.21s -> 4010.89s]  will be mine perhaps you might enjoy sharing easy you're gonna spell that
[4010.89s -> 4022.28s]  shit so what do I do Hoover Krueger Hoover Krueger what do I do Hoover
[4022.28s -> 4066.85s]  Krueger I can't shoot him from up here oh I hope the checkpoints really close I
[4066.85s -> 4073.72s]  thought I was gonna snipe him from all the way back there that would have
[4073.72s -> 4099.92s]  been so funny oh I was right at the checkpoint good very good yeah it's
[4099.92s -> 4101.84s]  this it's not I think it's time for this guy to go back to the
[4101.84s -> 4117.28s]  drawing board mojo Jojo tried this like three times already all right oh
[4117.28s -> 4126.08s]  god damn it all right whatever it's all right it's all right we've
[4126.64s -> 4130.36s]  watched this whole thing again all right this time I'm gonna who should I
[4130.36s -> 4138.95s]  shoot I point the gun at Hoover who should I point the gun at then not the
[4138.95s -> 4142.55s]  barrels right I thought the barrels is a great idea I'm gonna shoot the barrel
[4142.55s -> 4145.87s]  which is gonna destroy everything and everyone's gonna get the virus or
[4145.87s -> 4148.41s]  whatever all over them right that was like okay but then the guy just came
[4148.41s -> 4153.36s]  behind me the extra came behind me and hit me in the head so I was
[4153.36s -> 4157.22s]  supposed to know that was gonna happen it's gonna take it's gonna
[4157.22s -> 4162.81s]  take oh god it's gonna take forever yeah I'm gonna aim at Hoover that's a good
[4162.81s -> 4175.12s]  idea give it I I don't I can't you can't get cutscenes I don't get down
[4175.12s -> 4184.47s]  there I told you to stay someplace safe you need to watch this every time I
[4184.47s -> 4189.75s]  think we'll get it this time skip no way not in a hundred million years
[4189.75s -> 4213.38s]  let's go all right we're gonna aim the gun at Hoover I feel like Hoover's
[4213.38s -> 4215.98s]  gonna be like no no don't shoot me all right hold this is what's gonna
[4215.98s -> 4224.44s]  happen don't shoot me this guy's a snake right goodbye Hoover goodbye Kruger
[4228.81s -> 4244.58s]  I said the guy looks like Joe Biden no it looks like it looks like somebody
[4244.58s -> 4249.08s]  took young Joe Biden and put them in one of those age of five apps to make
[4249.08s -> 4275.96s]  old Joe Biden that's what it looks like all right we got to aim at this
[4275.96s -> 4282.42s]  guy go after him because I feel like you'll probably get another decision
[4282.42s -> 4293.94s]  guns don't even have barrels really bringing the crane well it gets the
[4293.94s -> 4296.74s]  same message
[4304.10s -> 4311.02s]  don't screw this up I don't want to watch the first five minutes of every
[4311.02s -> 4333.50s]  RTS phase no I don't want to watch this don't have much time okay here
[4333.54s -> 4353.68s]  we go over construction complete building building construction complete
[4353.68s -> 4365.20s]  unit lost unit lost Kruger Hoover drums what the fuck who did that and they
[4365.20s -> 4376.56s]  don't see me do that I don't care about him yeah I fucking knew it god
[4376.56s -> 4379.56s]  damn it
[4394.79s -> 4402.23s]  we have to watch the whole thing again or whatever I okay okay why would you
[4402.23s -> 4408.03s]  pick the goon I know I'm I don't care about him he's nothing to me kill him
[4408.03s -> 4419.95s]  it has to be the main guy but can I even get to the main guy I damn it that's so
[4419.95s -> 4435.80s]  funny it has to be a way to skip I'd really don't think there is it's space
[4435.80s -> 4446.08s]  I don't know I don't think it is yeah hey yeah this is very important to
[4446.08s -> 4464.03s]  remember this is 25 years old it's 25 years old how old are these actors
[4464.03s -> 4470.83s]  now the craziest part is the main character recorded voice lines with
[4470.91s -> 4477.35s]  this remaster so how old is this main character here probably in his I want to
[4477.35s -> 4483.92s]  say probably the 40s maybe early 40s probably so this this person the actor
[4483.92s -> 4499.10s]  might actually be in their late 60s into early 70s late 30s early 40s yeah
[4499.10s -> 4504.98s]  that's another thing spam every button no it doesn't do any I'm telling
[4504.98s -> 4512.70s]  you there is no skip he's George Bush from that's my bush gotta get
[4513.14s -> 4536.41s]  it was on Comedy Central he's almost as old as you are now now what I forgot
[4536.41s -> 4540.76s]  about that's why Bush yeah that was correct me if I'm wrong but that was
[4540.76s -> 4546.40s]  Trey Parker and Matt Stone made that show or at least Trey Parker did South
[4546.40s -> 4550.98s]  Park guys I think it was only live for like four episodes or like six
[4550.98s -> 4570.07s]  episodes goodbye Hoover goodbye Kruger here we go don't screw this up Bill
[4570.07s -> 4579.97s]  Murray is on the crane pay attention what Bill Murray pay attention how
[4579.97s -> 4588.36s]  carrying the virus somebody said I missed Bill Murray both times well I'm
[4588.36s -> 4600.18s]  not gonna miss him this time you said he's on the crane Bill Murray on the
[4600.18s -> 4607.06s]  crane so ready of over anticipating this I feel like it's not gonna be as
[4607.06s -> 4644.01s]  funny as you said it was okay where is he brain is the big moment that's not
[4644.01s -> 4648.09s]  even that's not even close it's his face is so pixelated in what is this
[4648.09s -> 4653.32s]  that's just a guy that's just a guy with like Bill Murray hair actually
[4653.32s -> 4658.28s]  hold on a minute don't have much time that was actually pretty close that
[4658.28s -> 4670.24s]  you okay here we go I gotta be ready Kruger what if none of them are

[4724.18s -> 4734.77s]  him earlier and now it's go for him I forgot there was a second choice
[4734.77s -> 4741.34s]  here you did Hoover last time no I tried to shoot him from down here I
[4741.34s -> 4753.28s]  grabbed his gun I tried to aim up at him and he shot her in the head
[4765.93s -> 4771.01s]  it's still a little bit in there I just picked that thing up and just
[4771.01s -> 4775.57s]  start going I would start inhaling right because you get like the
[4775.57s -> 4778.49s]  vapors in my help a little
[4783.22s -> 4794.13s]  yeah or like just touch a little bit of the wetness and get it again you
[4794.13s -> 4797.41s]  mucous membranes just put your fingers in your nose all the way
[4797.41s -> 4799.49s]  back and try to get it in there you get absorbed in your mucous
[4799.49s -> 4819.73s]  membranes I really don't want to have to view this whole thing again so
[4819.73s -> 4831.09s]  this better be right take it away did Hoover last time no I didn't I tried
[4831.09s -> 4834.25s]  to shoot up at Kruger I was like I'm gonna shoot him from here and I aimed

[5004.04s -> 5007.80s]  into it no this is horse shit you know why this is bullshit because think of
[5007.80s -> 5010.76s]  the other times where I've picked a decision where it was like oh go get
[5010.76s -> 5015.76s]  that guy and I just appeared tackling him that's happened like three times
[5015.76s -> 5020.46s]  guys there's been choices where he just had a gun in his pocket and he
[5020.46s -> 5029.47s]  didn't have it there before the game was showing me its hand do you remember
[5029.47s -> 5035.03s]  when I picked go for go to Hoover he fucking just was in mid tackle after
[5035.03s -> 5047.82s]  hiding behind a bush whatever the fuck was over there the game
[5047.82s -> 5069.96s]  gaslit you oh god damn it please tell me that no okay so to me fight
[5070.00s -> 5079.84s]  would have been stupid but oh grab the the plot device of the entire game but
[5079.84s -> 5083.24s]  how am I gonna fight a guy when I'm hanging from a ledge like that you
[5083.24s -> 5087.88s]  don't plot device plot device plot device plot device I've clicked the
[5087.88s -> 5107.55s]  plot device put something up distract us I have I have a really big apology
[5107.55s -> 5113.72s]  here for you if I click out of the window the game pauses and cannot play
[5113.92s -> 5121.81s]  we have to work again this is gonna be a bitch I can turn it down all right I
[5121.81s -> 5131.51s]  turned it down we're gonna talk about for like two minutes which we're
[5131.51s -> 5134.86s]  talking about you know well you get to see Bill yeah you'll see Bill Murray
[5134.86s -> 5145.38s]  again that's cool that's pretty cool stuff what I have a breakfast uh I had
[5145.38s -> 5158.07s]  a coffee and then I had nothing else I don't eat it's hard to eat
[5158.07s -> 5164.41s]  breakfast when I get up in the morning and going all the way into the early
[5164.41s -> 5170.42s]  afternoon I can't eat anything thought of eating breakfast a lot of times make
[5170.42s -> 5176.76s]  me kind of like nauseous I'm just not ready for food the first three or four
[5176.76s -> 5188.31s]  hours when I get up but coffee that I can do I usually eat lunch lunch some
[5188.31s -> 5194.07s]  kind of snack some kind of small mid late kind of afternoon meal and then
[5194.07s -> 5204.30s]  I do dinner breakfast is overrated anyways I mean breakfast is
[5204.30s -> 5211.56s]  incredibly important your body needs fuel to burn so you can function it's
[5211.56s -> 5216.54s]  important to do something you have any he'll I actually don't have any heels
[5216.54s -> 5228.04s]  left smoothies are good yeah that's that's a good idea you're being played
[5228.04s -> 5242.74s]  by big breakfast okay let me get this remember this drum Hoover fight drum
[5242.74s -> 5259.26s]  Hoover fight drum Hoover fight drum Hoover fight the essential breakfast
[5259.26s -> 5267.22s]  breakfast thing is legit just Kellogg's propaganda well I mean if
[5267.22s -> 5290.80s]  you if you eat just like sugary cereals all right here we go a lot
[5290.84s -> 5294.64s]  of cereals are just cotton candy with vitamin powder sprinkled all over it
[5294.64s -> 5315.20s]  pretty much the same thing Kruger over drums drums I feel like that would be a
[5315.20s -> 5323.68s]  great skrillex intro I mean don't shoot the drum call them off or you're
[5323.68s -> 5325.92s]  dead
[5328.88s -> 5344.22s]  mods aren't allowed to minus to me in this channel by the way game on it
[5344.22s -> 5358.06s]  see plot device plot device plot device plot device plot device here it
[5358.06s -> 5398.39s]  is why would I not click the plot device they've just been whatever royalty-free

[5503.04s -> 5510.85s]  they just did the Roger Rabbit routine same exact scenario bat of the acid
[5510.85s -> 5516.57s]  the juice dip weasel falls over laughing hits the thing and it moves

[5822.62s -> 5836.86s]  whole nother time if you want to go to a furry convention with a fursuit how
[5836.86s -> 5845.11s]  are you not a furry I just what just cuz I'm gonna I just cuz I'm gonna wear

[5872.36s -> 5875.24s]  fights an option then I'm gonna have my my wits are gonna be back about
[5875.24s -> 5895.13s]  me so I'll be able to fight and you do the ignoring annoying orange sound I'm
[5895.13s -> 5901.32s]  ignoring whom what am I ignoring are you a furry answer the question no I'm
[5901.32s -> 5905.16s]  not there you go is that is that's matter of
[5905.16s -> 5912.80s]  facts for you isn't it should be matter of fact for you somebody said
[5912.80s -> 5924.40s]  this is just golden eye except everything sucks don't you love it
[5924.40s -> 5931.87s]  though I'm so glad that we get to like see this and experience this
[5931.95s -> 5946.95s]  harvester meets James Bond harvester was fucked I would not play that game a
[5946.95s -> 5959.10s]  second time all right let's start the process here get the audio back where
[5959.10s -> 5972.22s]  it should be all right let's go I didn't realize the run he screams run
[5972.22s -> 6004.99s]  at the people drum Kruger Hoover drum from over fight yet and if there's
[6004.99s -> 6007.91s]  something afterwards again I have to remind myself a thousand times it's
[6007.91s -> 6011.88s]  fight if there's another choice is therefore I would have taken the
[6011.88s -> 6030.04s]  antidote marijuana is a memory loss drug I'm not
[6030.08s -> 6054.75s]  that would have been a huge mistake for this dream these serious don't get it
[6054.75s -> 6059.11s]  wrong every cell in your body is gonna mutate you're gonna be another one of
[6059.11s -> 6070.70s]  dr. Kruger's mindless zombies get it is wrong then that's not my fault
[6070.70s -> 6076.18s]  because you all we all have come to a consensus here that I need to get it
[6076.18s -> 6084.88s]  when it's on the ground because otherwise I turn into the zombie
[6086.88s -> 6094.43s]  we get a poll we get a short poll as to what I should do on the second after
[6094.43s -> 6099.79s]  I fight the first time in a poll I need because I if I'm gonna be wrong I
[6099.79s -> 6102.19s]  need a bunch of people to be wrong too so we can all be wrong together so
[6102.19s -> 6114.21s]  I don't feel as bad bite or get on the second attempt one that we just
[6114.25s -> 6124.31s]  died at we go within three minutes Los Angeles will be mine perhaps you might

[6160.08s -> 6179.54s]  Wilhelm Wilhelm okay why do we got anything 80% yet so if I'm wrong you're
[6179.54s -> 6210.67s]  wrong too this guy shoots so many bullets like I
[6210.67s -> 6222.62s]  probably gonna throw in a rock and hit me easier than his shooting okay
[6222.62s -> 6255.82s]  right right yeah I swear to God if it's not like rabbit fight there we go I
[6255.82s -> 6268.21s]  am so nervous right now I am like my heart's kind of pumping because I'm

[6378.20s -> 6393.97s]  saved us all why does why does Laura not get a medal sometimes it's all
[6394.27s -> 6403.14s]  worth what was what why is Laura not get a medal for that you sponsor her like
[6403.14s -> 6411.06s]  kill count at the end there was like fucking 30 people I can't do that
[6411.06s -> 6429.94s]  without her that's cool we need an alternate ending all right I am willing
[6429.94s -> 6433.66s]  to play through one and not play through I just want to say there's
[6433.66s -> 6441.77s]  some stuff early that I really want to see there's a lot of other shit
[6441.77s -> 6458.18s]  that we need to know where it goes play I start from the beginning oh
[6458.32s -> 6468.49s]  shit I can do this checkpoint locked all this so much this will be locked
[6468.49s -> 6477.63s]  checkpoints all right I'm not doing party party torturing 14,000 people I

[6541.48s -> 6547.29s]  interesting okay
[6550.69s -> 6558.86s]  pinhead the voiceover lines were not in the original now no way the actor
[6558.86s -> 6565.23s]  actually came back to rerecord them I'm surprised they didn't port this to
[6565.23s -> 6570.62s]  something else here's trouble this whole thing was done even if it was
[6570.62s -> 6573.54s]  not on the Jaguar why would they not release it all right so now you can piss
[6573.54s -> 6579.50s]  off Sega Saturn or something take a CD it's Colonel BFD the old man has a

[8175.01s -> 8179.33s]  breeze blew out my candle and I could barely make out my surroundings in the
[8179.33s -> 8186.72s]  darkness I should have taken the rope or something use your last match go look
[8186.72s -> 8196.90s]  for another candle uh match don't have a flashlight since I didn't get the

[8461.45s -> 8467.45s]  it's packaged up I walked up the creeping front steps and turned the knob all
[8467.45s -> 8472.50s]  right the ladies here I have a choice to turn around or get the key from under
[8472.50s -> 8478.35s]  the mat and then what do I do about the lady try just naturally talk to the
[8478.35s -> 8485.39s]  lady there was a key to fit the front door under the mat the stench was
[8485.39s -> 8490.23s]  awful it was like entering a tube I just keep running from the layers to
[8490.23s -> 8495.39s]  my right and a room to my left and I felt a cold chill on the back of my
[8495.39s -> 8505.17s]  neck carefully climb should I carefully climb the stairs yeah if I sneak I
[8505.17s -> 8510.37s]  probably can as I ascended the rotting stairs I began to feel as if I were
[8510.37s -> 8521.23s]  being followed from the top of the stairs I could see a woman below okay
[8521.23s -> 8534.18s]  I don't have a weapon holy water use the holy water her skin erupted as
[8534.18s -> 8545.08s]  the water splashed on the stench was awful the second floor looked dark and
[8545.08s -> 8553.60s]  uninviting okay that was a waste I don't know if I could have got away check
[8553.60s -> 8558.40s]  on her condition run into the nearest room right I don't you have so much
[8558.40s -> 8566.60s]  there's not enough time my fear faded as I fled I felt fine till I fell so
[8566.60s -> 8570.80s]  I flipped over and found I'd been followed by a fanged femme fatale with
[8570.80s -> 8579.72s]  a fried finger it's her use the vial of holy water I don't do I have it kick
[8579.72s -> 8586.01s]  her teeth out oh I don't still have any left it wasn't till I cut my hand on
[8586.01s -> 8589.95s]  the broken glass that I realized that the bottle of holy water wasn't
[8589.95s -> 8603.22s]  shatterproof I just well here we go again I don't know how long I was out
[8603.22s -> 8608.50s]  but someone or something had dragged me to a seller below der Hatchet
[8608.70s -> 8614.99s]  is this guy as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and
[8614.99s -> 8618.91s]  looked around which disappeared after the fool could see that the place had
[8618.91s -> 8624.43s]  more than its share of dingbats and I was no exception
[8625.23s -> 8632.94s]  find who dragged you in here explode go looking for trouble find who dragged
[8632.94s -> 8638.82s]  you here I don't I think these are all the same thing it was there in
[8638.82s -> 8643.82s]  the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil grin what's
[8643.82s -> 8647.03s]  the correct play here
[8661.80s -> 8666.54s]  all right so now what are the choices don't lunge at him grab his shovel
[8666.54s -> 8674.90s]  glance past him say don't turn around and you bait him he fell for it so I
[8674.98s -> 8681.06s]  took the opportunity to bash him in the chops I never hit a man when he's down
[8681.06s -> 8685.66s]  but I knew I should have white an exception when I felt his fingers on
[8685.66s -> 8697.81s]  my throat you can't be serious I have to flip that second off she's not
[8697.81s -> 8704.05s]  gonna do anything flip up I flipped him into his coal bin and ran into the
[8704.09s -> 8712.38s]  darkness that's not gonna kill me okay laundry why would I hit somebody with a
[8712.38s -> 8715.34s]  shovel and be like you know I don't hit a person when they're down even if
[8715.34s -> 8723.28s]  they're a degenerate murdering zombie person find an elevator find an
[8723.28s -> 8734.28s]  elevator I found myself ascending a steep circular stairway when a green
[8734.28s -> 8740.36s]  ghoul in a rented tuxedo made a dramatic entrance these people just
[8740.40s -> 8744.36s]  went to the Halloween store and bought everything on the rack and then just
[8744.36s -> 8748.74s]  decided to shoot stuff with it and they made choices around it they were just
[8748.74s -> 8753.79s]  having a they're just having like fun for like a weekend let's make some
[8753.79s -> 8759.25s]  small talk see if it works I approached the zombie reluctant took his hat off
[8759.25s -> 8771.05s]  and asked him who his tailor was his response he took his hat off like oh
[8771.05s -> 8790.72s]  it's me hello oh floor surprise me um surprise me we arrived on the first
[8790.72s -> 8796.04s]  floor and I got off I could hear faint piano music coming from somewhere
[8796.04s -> 8805.68s]  piano music this is it could be anything I have no idea um enter the
[8805.68s -> 8814.84s]  room on the left the room was crawling with vermin but otherwise
[8815.28s -> 8826.78s]  empty they're so cute they just have that is vibing leave him alone follow the
[8826.78s -> 8837.89s]  rats yeah they know what they're doing the next room I came to had nothing in
[8837.89s -> 8843.54s]  it there was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of potions on the
[8843.54s -> 8851.55s]  other Frank one of the random potions just as I started to examine them I
[8851.55s -> 8868.82s]  heard a scream okay find a place to hide open the freezer I'm putting the few
[8868.82s -> 8876.20s]  reasons I opened the freezer be only to find another prisoner of this horrible
[8876.20s -> 8879.78s]  place
[8896.54s -> 8900.54s]  we have to keep this guy alive
[8907.78s -> 8911.14s]  you wouldn't have a car by any chance you wouldn't be going to your Fresno
[8911.14s -> 8921.78s]  area Fresno's really not that far he was unfortunately an obnoxious jerk
[8921.78s -> 8926.54s]  who didn't have anything intelligent off money or a cigarette you thought
[8926.54s -> 8930.54s]  what a jerk it's remarkably still alive what are you talking about this
[8930.54s -> 8935.02s]  guy could probably help see what he knows about the house what do you know

[8939.94s -> 8944.22s]  crazy I mean I couldn't get out of the box how am I supposed to know how to get

[8959.96s -> 8966.62s]  monster in the house maybe this is not a person I give him five bucks I
[8966.86s -> 8983.80s]  gave him five dollars and left okay leave this loony bin behind search
[8983.80s -> 8993.04s]  remaining rooms search remaining rooms that actually might have been a
[8993.04s -> 9003.35s]  monster to the next room I heard the scream again take the source of the
[9003.35s -> 9011.55s]  scream we have to know we have to know returning to the hall I glanced
[9011.55s -> 9023.67s]  up to where the sound came from Jesus see run away right but I don't know
[9023.67s -> 9030.52s]  see what he does next run see what he does

[9068.45s -> 9074.33s]  know you never know god damn it I was at the end of my rope when I realized
[9074.33s -> 9080.06s]  that I was I was fit to be tied all right so we got this right last time
[9080.06s -> 9082.94s]  life hung in the balance we have to like tie this guy up or something this
[9082.94s -> 9107.98s]  was no time for reflection if I didn't stream I would probably be this guy
[9108.02s -> 9115.22s]  like if I was on a streamer what did YouTube or something I would have
[9115.22s -> 9120.90s]  probably been that guy at some point something clever I was trying to
[9120.90s -> 9127.48s]  think of a diversion when I lost this was the right thing last thing hit
[9127.48s -> 9140.96s]  something okay you need to get the rope I got up I saw monster or the
[9140.96s -> 9147.36s]  actor the actor on laughing boy the actor not the guy what he's doing the

[9207.04s -> 9219.20s]  old coins wine cryptic runes decipher the ruins just as I picked up the
[9219.20s -> 9228.27s]  papers the candle lit itself and a funky phantom friar floated into the room
[9233.31s -> 9241.52s]  this guy looks friendly okay burn his papers enjoy wine and candlelight he's
[9241.52s -> 9246.24s]  snapping his fingers the candle and a glass of the house vino and the
[9246.24s -> 9253.54s]  phantom friar gave up the ghost what I didn't want to kill him he just wanted
[9253.54s -> 9263.77s]  to hang out oops well I guess I won half of these monsters come up to me

[9318.22s -> 9336.00s]  uninviting it could room at random find the kitchen the room I next entered
[9336.00s -> 9342.14s]  was obviously a library of some sort great job finding the kitchen there
[9342.14s -> 9346.10s]  is there was a door to my left another dead ahead but most of the
[9346.10s -> 9351.02s]  action was taking place in the kitchen on my right someone was practicing a
[9351.02s -> 9363.99s]  bizarre form of culinary preparation right let's go right let's see I
[9363.99s -> 9368.61s]  couldn't put my finger on it but there was something odd about the
[9368.61s -> 9381.39s]  woman in the kitchen I think maybe it was her three-day beard okay grab
[9381.39s -> 9396.29s]  some food and go can I look in the fridge oh it's Edna fine a find the

[9428.62s -> 9433.54s]  quietly I don't want to do anything else out of the kitchen and left her to
[9433.74s -> 9443.76s]  work a faint breeze carried a musty odor to my sensitive nostrils okay well
[9443.76s -> 9447.16s]  over to the closed door okay we're gonna peek through that I'm not going
[9447.16s -> 9455.14s]  in there just yet this room seemed to be a laboratory there was something
[9455.14s -> 9465.61s]  odd about it and then I realized what it was the room suddenly I realized
[9465.61s -> 9473.72s]  that someone was coming up behind me it's a vampire see the teeth jump in
[9473.72s -> 9481.14s]  the tub and quickly jump in the tub thinking quickly I stepped into the
[9481.14s -> 9487.52s]  shower and pulled the curtain closed a hairy paw reached in and turned on
[9487.52s -> 9496.58s]  the water I peered around the corner and saw a she wolf busily primping

[10025.53s -> 10027.69s]  the elevator I don't want to go anywhere though I don't want to go back
[10027.69s -> 10041.19s]  down I'm surprised but I don't what if I don't say anything will he keep me on
[10041.19s -> 10059.02s]  this floor somewhere back in the elevator right down the hallway the
[10059.02s -> 10063.02s]  next room I came to had nothing in it all right here's there was an old
[10063.02s -> 10068.06s]  freezer on one side okay we're gonna try to get more info from the hippie

[10119.39s -> 10129.92s]  strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets instant steak instant
[10129.92s -> 10138.22s]  strength steak or strength steak or straight steak I wasn't hungry now but
[10138.22s -> 10145.66s]  an instant steak might come in handy later yeah we have to put this into
[10145.66s -> 10153.11s]  his wine right because it goes in you and it's a steak and you what
[10153.11s -> 10159.05s]  about the stench why does it smell because then it'll the steak will blow
[10159.05s -> 10168.97s]  up in his body right it sticks to your ribs yeah that means that it's gonna
[10168.97s -> 10175.72s]  turn into a steak inside your body you could bathe more off all right I
[10175.72s -> 10179.58s]  gotta leave we're gonna we're gonna both die from this like poison I gave
[10179.58s -> 10188.03s]  him five dollars and left if the vampire eats this somehow whether we
[10188.03s -> 10192.68s]  have I don't know how we get it to have him to eat it all right we're

[10213.82s -> 10219.97s]  keep moving forward this guy knocks you up I ran through the door and found
[10219.97s -> 10225.53s]  myself near the elevator okay up I pushed the button and waited there
[10225.53s -> 10237.21s]  was a green door to my left and a stairway to my right wait for the
[10237.25s -> 10245.12s]  elevator but what if he comes out what's behind the green door I walked over and
[10245.12s -> 10249.12s]  opened the green door well the last thing I remember is staring at the
[10249.12s -> 10262.70s]  hole in his chest where a steak should have been oh come on come on I
[10262.70s -> 10268.82s]  came to in an attic someone or something was sitting across the attic
[10269.42s -> 10270.42s]  shit
[10272.10s -> 10274.10s]  Don't go look for double E
[10280.98s -> 10282.98s]  I wonder if this way I can get through this
[10289.78s -> 10299.73s]  maybe maybe it's too small maybe he didn't take it okay uh yeah I don't know you
[10304.45s -> 10306.45s]  I love this costume
[10326.07s -> 10335.94s]  okay uh should I offer him a bribe that's the only thing I haven't
[10336.26s -> 10348.08s]  picked my pockets were empty I took the liberty of removing everything from
[10348.08s -> 10353.04s]  your pocket I love this guy this was count your
[10353.04s -> 10358.80s]  Chakonsky I knew I had failed when I looked into his eyes I was powerless
[10358.80s -> 10365.56s]  to resist him all right I'm gonna try this one more
[10365.56s -> 10373.94s]  time let me try one more time come on at least well I opened the green door and
[10373.94s -> 10378.90s]  it was okay like I choose your adventure game there's a reason why you
[10378.90s -> 10384.66s]  hold your finger on the previous page because open door on right guy kills
[10384.66s -> 10388.08s]  you you know that's okay well fuck that I'm not doing that one and you
[10388.08s -> 10391.20s]  keep your hand your finger on the tab you go back and you choose the
[10391.20s -> 10413.92s]  right one you're cheating at books that's not cheating it's not cheating
[10413.92s -> 10421.78s]  there's still so much stuff okay where do I where am I what am I doing wrong
[10422.50s -> 10428.05s]  there's a lot more in this game that I really thought there was all right one more try
[10431.99s -> 10446.80s]  holy water and then we gotta leave he wanted money all right but it was for a good cause
[10448.08s -> 10455.99s]  okay it was nice to see you the okay don't send in the next client it's the guy that
[10455.99s -> 10468.45s]  punches you so I'm gone the derhatchet institute was founded by
[10468.53s -> 10484.93s]  under the mat of course naturally there was a key to the back of my neck okay now what
[10484.93s -> 10492.00s]  over my shoulder is the girl explore the room everything is the girl I think the
[10492.00s -> 10499.36s]  candlelit room should be okay the room was crawling with vermin but otherwise empty
[10499.36s -> 10505.59s]  she follows oh god damn it she follows you both times she follows you in both scenarios I don't
[10505.67s -> 10520.31s]  think you can avoid this wait explain I can't run I could sense that she was attracted to me
[10520.31s -> 10531.88s]  what run tell her she has nice eyes what I don't understand what do you if I hadn't
[10531.88s -> 10540.39s]  been so busy talking I might have noticed what why isn't a run really listening I can't believe
[10540.39s -> 10543.91s]  there's not oh god damn it I could have avoided that all right there's one here's how
[10543.91s -> 10549.75s]  you avoid that one you just have to go up the stairs and run because if you go to the
[10549.75s -> 10555.51s]  candle it wrong I was out but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below
[10555.51s -> 10560.95s]  derhatchet holy water works but she follows you up the stairs as I struggled to clear my head
[10560.95s -> 10563.59s]  I clicked on my flashlight and looked around
[10569.99s -> 10574.00s]  all right these are yeah these all don't go look for trouble these all lead to the same
[10574.00s -> 10584.07s]  place anyways it was there in the cellar that I just okay so what's the correct thing with
[10584.07s -> 10592.36s]  this guy don't turn around glance past him just just glance past him what if we don't attack
[10593.40s -> 10598.92s]  he fell for it so I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops he fell for me looking the
[10598.92s -> 10604.12s]  other way I never hit a man when he's down but I knew I should have made an exception when
[10604.12s -> 10616.36s]  I felt his fingers on my throat can you avoid this guy oh flip over backwards right
[10617.88s -> 10622.28s]  I flipped him into his cold bin and ran into the darkness
[10631.51s -> 10641.27s]  Egyptology laundry look look for a stairway I don't think we did the stairway last time
[10644.64s -> 10652.13s]  I found myself ascending a steep here's the guy with the hat when a green ghoul
[10652.13s -> 10659.51s]  and a resin tuxedo made a dramatic entrance I wonder if there's a wrong option with this guy
[10660.71s -> 10669.41s]  proceed small I don't think it really matters let's just do small talk
[10672.44s -> 10677.99s]  I approached the zombie I don't want to go down I don't want to go down the to the
[10678.79s -> 10683.06s]  what if I say mind your own business that's the one option I did not do
[10688.69s -> 10694.61s]  we arrived on the first floor and I got off I could hear faint piano music coming from
[10694.61s -> 10704.53s]  somewhere all right where's the steak kitchen I don't I don't remember where the kitchen is
[10704.53s -> 10710.55s]  is it straight I'm getting so turned around like I don't even know what
[10710.55s -> 10715.35s]  any of these options really go the next room I came to had nothing in it okay here we go
[10715.35s -> 10720.15s]  there was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of potions on the other
[10720.15s -> 10744.60s]  so that we want the steak one we gotta give this guy money uh what about those potion bottles
[10744.60s -> 10750.68s]  hey man you don't want to be messing with those chemicals man they're bad for your karma
[10752.71s -> 10759.83s]  I read the labels extra strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablet
[10759.83s -> 10771.16s]  anti-gravity I feel like the steak is the is the correct option steak I wasn't hungry now
[10771.16s -> 10780.04s]  but an instant steak might come in handy later we'll stick to your ribs I gotta get up the
[10780.04s -> 10792.24s]  stair okay wait should I take the anti-gravity one too anti-grav tablets I noticed something
[10792.24s -> 10805.94s]  strange from the moment I opened the jar get some strength stop get the all right take the
[10805.94s -> 10810.50s]  instant strength potion and run taking the extra strength I gotta get out of here like a good
[10810.50s -> 10822.44s]  idea till I read the fine print oh god damn it we're dead we're dead ask take a deep breath
[10822.44s -> 10830.68s]  no run run run how do I get out run leave the fumes in the room no I'm trying to get out
[10831.32s -> 10844.39s]  and consequently I oh come on so I blacked out well how was how was I gonna know that
[10844.39s -> 10849.19s]  like it was there was a two joke options that I was at the end of my rope the anti-gravity
[10849.19s -> 10867.54s]  pills oh they fly up I was fit to be I did the situation none of this matters I was trying to
[10867.54s -> 10876.53s]  think of a diversion when I lost my footing and then how do I get up to the attic started
[10876.53s -> 10888.85s]  to slip away as the rope bit into my neck okay let's get them make good use of the rope
[10888.85s -> 10895.01s]  I told laughing boy was bound to be out of circulation for a while but he didn't
[10895.01s -> 10903.67s]  appreciate the gag okay so now from here look for a sign oh I don't think we clicked this
[10903.67s -> 10918.82s]  yet I'm pretty sure this is one I have not done look for a sign I did okay music I need
[10918.82s -> 10924.52s]  like a piece of paper that has like the blueprint of this house it's just like teleporting around
[10924.52s -> 10933.65s]  I was like my brain cannot remember where I am oh let's go do this the next room contained an
[10933.65s -> 10937.41s]  old writing desk under the derhatchet family we'll get points for getting rid of this on
[10937.41s -> 10950.36s]  the desk were many items of interest decipher the cryptic rune and then that makes him come
[10950.36s -> 10956.52s]  over and then we put it in the thing and we burn up the papers the candle lit itself
[10956.60s -> 10960.12s]  here we go and a funky phantom friar floated into the room
[10968.21s -> 10978.29s]  okay enjoy wine and candle light I extinguished the candle in a glass of the house vino
[10978.29s -> 10990.77s]  and the phantom friar gave up the ghost okay so from here we're still down I have the coins
[10991.94s -> 10998.42s]  I need to find my way up to the second floor find the elevator look for a way out okay
[10999.06s -> 11004.69s]  I'll get the golden split we did this last time which takes us outside
[11005.41s -> 11027.51s]  we can go to the elevator okay get in the elevator I want to go to the second floor
[11030.02s -> 11044.68s]  what floor please second floor so then from here where do I go from here
[11044.68s -> 11049.16s]  then remember second floor look dark and uninviting remember where to go from here
[11049.72s -> 11065.04s]  to get to the guy the kitchen all right yeah the kitchen already beat the last score the
[11065.04s -> 11074.04s]  room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort there was a door I don't remember
[11074.04s -> 11079.56s]  what timeline but most of the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right
[11079.56s -> 11085.16s]  where someone was practicing a bizarre form of here we go we're gonna go into the kitchen
[11085.16s -> 11094.61s]  get the points and towards the right I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something
[11094.61s -> 11104.98s]  was good eat holy shit it actually was good eats I think maybe it was her three-day beard
[11108.12s -> 11121.72s]  wow okay look in the fridge no way are you kidding me this game came out like how long ago
[11121.72s -> 11133.12s]  10 20 years ago inside the cupboard was a rose a clove of garlic and a couple of potatoes
[11133.84s -> 11138.80s]  so let me get this right my memory is fucking dog shit after this where do I want to go after
[11138.80s -> 11145.57s]  this I don't want to do the um I don't want to deal with the the wolf I reached in and took
[11145.57s -> 11160.37s]  the clove of garlic wolf is a death scenario okay sneak away sneak away quietly right I need
[11160.37s -> 11165.86s]  a drink I need the rose tiptoed out of the kitchen and left her right from here from here
[11165.86s -> 11170.34s]  where the fuck do I go from here a faint breeze carried a musty odor to my sensitive
[11170.66s -> 11181.32s]  I'm not going in there okay peek through go over to follow the breeze all the breeze I don't want
[11181.32s -> 11189.70s]  to go in the bathroom this room seems to be a laboratory I thought that was the closed door
[11190.34s -> 11196.26s]  I gotta get out of here right now realized what it was the room smelled like a wet dog
[11198.79s -> 11203.03s]  suddenly I realized that someone was coming up behind me I don't what I do I don't know
[11203.03s -> 11208.96s]  what to do what do I do what do I do turn around think quickly what the fuck am I
[11208.96s -> 11217.49s]  supposed to do think quickly thinking quickly I stepped into the shower and pulled the curtain
[11217.49s -> 11227.49s]  closed a hairy paw okay I don't think what should I do I peered around the corner you
[11227.49s -> 11233.33s]  have to flirt with the wolf she wolf busily primping herself for a night on the town
[11234.29s -> 11248.04s]  okay I'm gonna try um I give a you want me to show the flirt
[11255.62s -> 11263.03s]  and giggled like a school girl what then she started towards me are you kidding me
[11263.03s -> 11273.06s]  those eyes my life what do I do um um um puck her up puck her up puck her up puck her up
[11273.46s -> 11280.16s]  she's coming over I don't know she looked forward and planted a wet sloppy kiss on my lips
[11280.88s -> 11288.92s]  then stepped aside to let me pass got it okay now what smile and leave enter the room across the
[11288.92s -> 11293.96s]  say smile and leave the room all right bye bye smile I don't want to have to be followed
[11293.96s -> 11300.88s]  I stopped for a moment near the doorway okay we've not gone this far for good luck and now
[11300.88s -> 11306.48s]  from here I rounded the corner and very nearly bumped into a female vampire
[11307.76s -> 11316.63s]  she was starting to leave when I gave myself away shit okay well I have garlic confront her
[11316.63s -> 11321.19s]  hide um confront her I have garlic I have garlic I'm gonna do it I have garlic I'm gonna do it
[11321.19s -> 11328.36s]  I have garlic I'm gonna do it could see she was in no mood for a confrontation I have I have
[11328.36s -> 11338.08s]  garlic in my pocket what I have the stakes I have the guard why can't I attack I came to in an
[11338.08s -> 11344.42s]  attic someone or something was sitting across the attic from me I have garlic and I have the
[11344.42s -> 11353.22s]  steak pill and holy water decides to pay a visit to his host oh well have you enjoyed our
[11353.22s -> 11360.18s]  hospitality so many 500 points it's fine at least we seduced the werewolf it was difficult
[11360.18s -> 11370.20s]  not to listen his voice had a strong hypnotic effect god damn it well let's just get as many
[11370.20s -> 11378.12s]  I'm trying to get to 8000 points you don't know me I love this guy but I know you you have in
[11378.12s -> 11386.20s]  my inventory in consciousness was all the shit that vampires are weak against holy water see
[11386.28s -> 11394.20s]  steaks garlics I couldn't use any of them I picked out close to your heart that was my blood
[11394.20s -> 11397.88s]  he was sucking on I'm not gonna beat it you have to this is guys this game came out like
[11397.88s -> 11406.61s]  in 1984 1985 or something find something of value I don't have anything quickly I checked
[11406.61s -> 11419.72s]  my pockets what is it what's going on what's in my pocket throw a gold
[11419.72s -> 11432.98s]  coin kick in the groin what should I do I tried to attack but I can't do it into my eyes and I
[11432.98s -> 11442.76s]  knew I had failed I blacked out what would you pick the gold coins out why wouldn't you take
[11442.76s -> 11448.60s]  why wouldn't garlic be an option why wouldn't the steak pill a holy water he didn't take the
[11448.60s -> 11457.01s]  shit out of my pockets this time I have coin where I throw a coin at him why don't you give
[11457.01s -> 11462.82s]  him a coin because I want to try to kick the guy in the groin all right this game came out
[11462.82s -> 11467.06s]  in like 1992 are you serious you don't think it would have been like a comedy routine where
[11467.06s -> 11475.97s]  it's he goes like oh my oh my balls I was going for like the stupid like 90s comedy routine
[11475.97s -> 11489.20s]  this game came out in 2016 it wasn't yet but it wasn't filmed in 2016 it was filmed
[11489.20s -> 11507.76s]  in probably like 1990 shit all right well that was fun the game was made in 84 yeah come on well
[11507.76s -> 11537.56s]  now let's watch them well now we can see the music video wait did showing him dying what the
[11537.56s -> 11563.40s]  hell was that we didn't see any of this stuff oh we didn't get any of these options behind
[11563.40s -> 11576.40s]  the scenes yeah I think the skeleton guy's mouth is partially made from a baseball mitt
[11576.48s -> 11599.43s]  is this like a wizard like cantaloupe no not really I can't believe there's a wizard that
[11599.43s -> 11630.84s]  can cast fireball at you play it again oh you need to probably have the ace for that
[11630.84s -> 11634.93s]  the thing with these old games though is you have to be so weirdly specific about everything
[11634.93s -> 11674.16s]  to see some of this stuff some random lady we saw that plenty of times wait was that the real
[11674.80s -> 11693.32s]  ending villain that was fun actually in love with this game play more play again use a
[11693.32s -> 11698.16s]  walkthrough I could just use a walkthrough you look at the restoration of a 16 millimeter
[11698.16s -> 11702.96s]  film adaptation of the original interactive text adventure designed wait this is an
[11702.96s -> 11713.40s]  it's a text adventure that's why it feels like this uh remember the chance to create
[11713.40s -> 11719.41s]  a feature-length interactive film I wanted to read that vampires wanted restoration
[11720.13s -> 11725.92s]  that's really cool I did not back-to-back games that just never released
[11726.56s -> 11737.65s]  it's really interesting I love this shit I really do this kind of old-fashioned way to
[11737.65s -> 11746.05s]  have the sort of old 16 millimeter fmb games with all the weird goofy choices I love this shit
[11750.98s -> 11758.69s]  people still make them now but the people make interactive movies right now right
[11759.33s -> 11765.41s]  there's been a few of them one more playthrough all right one more time with I'm gonna get a
[11765.41s -> 12023.43s]  walkthrough I'm gonna go pee though I'll be right back boys and girls a little bit of an
[12023.43s -> 12032.50s]  issue here we have a little bit of a small problem here I don't think a walkthrough exists
[12032.50s -> 12044.96s]  for this game I don't see any there are no walkthroughs so that's bad make the walkthrough
[12044.96s -> 12061.28s]  did you even go to the bathroom I did I was promised to overwatch I don't I think you're
[12061.28s -> 12073.11s]  in the wrong place nobody's beaten this we'll help you you gotta be quick though you gotta
[12073.11s -> 12077.59s]  be really quick it's like two seconds it takes three seconds for the stream delay to kick in
[12077.59s -> 12091.68s]  for you guys to see what happened we're not gonna be able to do it I can't elongate that slow your
[12091.68s -> 12105.84s]  CPU down what if you alt tab does it actually let me test that let me just see if this works if I
[12105.84s -> 12119.51s]  like tab out will the game stop no it just keeps going yeah it keeps going wait a minute
[12119.51s -> 12125.51s]  wait a minute wait a minute what if I had known this shit this would have been so much
[12125.51s -> 12136.87s]  better guys oh my god damn it take a look at this get a good view get a good view
[12136.87s -> 12150.18s]  the timer doesn't do anything when it gets to zero it's just points I was panicking half the
[12150.18s -> 12166.55s]  time because I thought are you kidding me it's just puts your score up higher well you can help
[12166.55s -> 12174.61s]  let's figure this out together and this needs to be unanimous so the obvious play here
[12174.61s -> 12179.27s]  is I can't believe this I could have whatever we're gonna meet the gentleman
[12182.96s -> 12189.68s]  wanted money all right for a good cause thank you mr specter whatever your name is
[12189.68s -> 12199.67s]  tax deductible deductible they're not deductible okay so this just means a lot of points mid
[12199.67s -> 12207.17s]  points not I don't care if I get zero points I just want to see the end of the game okay
[12207.17s -> 12216.96s]  we do click maps click max is gonna take way too long all right the obvious thing here is
[12216.96s -> 12223.32s]  I have the holy water I don't want to send in do click maps I don't even I don't even
[12223.32s -> 12235.59s]  have it like installed we can do quick polls how long does the poll take just give us two
[12235.59s -> 12239.27s]  seconds to click hold all right well then give me a second I gotta like enable it again
[12239.27s -> 12246.24s]  oh this again I might I might not be able to do it no click map the shortest poll is one
[12246.24s -> 12253.60s]  minute that's much easier click okay to enable click maps have you guys click and me disable
[12253.60s -> 12269.27s]  it is like 45 seconds a b or c let's go the very obvious one I know how to get here it's b
[12273.17s -> 12281.06s]  I know how to get us into the room into the door the derhatchet institute was founded by a
[12281.06s -> 12292.05s]  noble prize-winning scientist locked is what okay fine we have not done we've only done look
[12292.05s -> 12303.56s]  under the mat what do you guys want to do let's open it up why not we'll do a full
[12303.56s -> 12315.48s]  chats choice run how does that sound and I look I can look at this as it's coming in
[12316.20s -> 12321.88s]  and yeah it's not gonna take 60 seconds look at 66 percent of the vote wants me to go a
[12322.44s -> 12328.60s]  so I could theoretically just once it once it becomes like a 50 to 60 percent majority
[12328.60s -> 12332.98s]  I'm just gonna go can you just close the poll like if you cancel the poll right now just
[12332.98s -> 12339.16s]  close it like I know that's 67 percent of voted for a and there's no way B is coming back
[12339.16s -> 12354.26s]  I can just do it right yeah let's go that works find another way inside as I walked around
[12354.26s -> 12360.90s]  the house I saw an open window high above me isn't that where the guy is I found a ladder
[12360.90s -> 12371.57s]  leaning next to another window okay I think that's where the guy is well there we go
[12371.57s -> 12378.76s]  perfect so after the poll is over it gives enough time after majority is seen to just
[12378.76s -> 12384.13s]  keep going that's perfect timing okay we can either climb the ladder look around explore
[12384.13s -> 12390.13s]  the extensive grounds or move ladder to access the open window I'm just going to tell you
[12390.39s -> 12395.11s]  I am under the impression here that I think that's the um the Count Dooku guy
[12395.11s -> 12404.47s]  uh the gravest guy is up there this is extraordinarily unanimous looks like we're
[12404.47s -> 12418.88s]  going to see I moved the ladder and started I hope it's him I was halfway through the window
[12418.88s -> 12424.16s]  looking at the ground below when I was struck from above by what felt like a Louisville slugger
[12425.46s -> 12437.32s]  the gorilla hovering above me was a bat from the big leagues push its face in swing for
[12437.32s -> 12446.05s]  the fences or maintain a safe distance I doubt any of these work if I'm going to be honest with
[12446.05s -> 12460.56s]  you a bat from the big leagues well B makes sense because B is part of the pun right
[12460.56s -> 12475.76s]  it's waiting for the fences a big bat from the big leagues all right we'll go and be
[12475.76s -> 12483.11s]  it's unanimous waiting for the fence I grabbed the bat with both hands and swung
[12483.11s -> 12488.31s]  away from me to say it looked angry would be a gross understatement that definitely hurt
[12488.31s -> 12501.88s]  the actor okay snare the bat with the rope climb up to the rafters or use the rope to escape
[12510.88s -> 12520.20s]  snare the bat with the rope that's in that it's 80 percent of the votes so far
[12520.20s -> 12530.29s]  yeah okay snare the bat I grabbed the rope and a trap door opened as we're running fell
[12530.29s -> 12536.69s]  for what seemed to be a long long time they hit the ground hard fortunately I broke my
[12536.77s -> 12543.00s]  fall on something soft well well what do you think you're doing mother doesn't like anybody
[12543.00s -> 12552.15s]  playing in our laundry do your mom that's right stay out of my laundry why did he change
[12552.15s -> 12568.29s]  his voice halfway through this guy was obviously a psycho this guy's a psycho uh
[12570.23s -> 12579.35s]  why does it sound like bobcat gault wait I mean I had to like make sounds and make voices
[12579.35s -> 12585.99s]  and stuff like that it sounds like me you guys say this to me all right give the psycho
[12585.99s -> 12596.50s]  a closer look go find the butler give mama a friendly smile well I think this is the death
[12596.50s -> 12601.80s]  one but we have to click it because that's what you guys want to do give mama a friendly smile
[12609.73s -> 12635.48s]  yet within striking distance casually gain his confidence or go find the butler
[12635.48s -> 12639.24s]  I'm convinced that you made this game and this is some kind of prank stream I wish I
[12639.24s -> 12659.84s]  did I wish I made this game all right we're going to be I moved cautiously towards mama's
[12660.16s -> 12671.73s]  watch it right okay you guys got that double wrong that's double wrong he flattened your nose
[12671.73s -> 12681.35s]  I don't know how long I was out but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below
[12681.35s -> 12689.11s]  der hatchet manor as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and looked
[12689.11s -> 12695.19s]  around any fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats and I was
[12695.19s -> 12707.43s]  no exception FMV game you know how badly I've okay here's the problem there's I have to be
[12707.43s -> 12713.59s]  careful for like shotgun blasting out a bunch of ideas that I think are really fun because
[12714.15s -> 12722.63s]  I have to focus on only a few things at a time make no mistake about it I would love
[12722.63s -> 12732.00s]  nothing more than to put hundreds and hundreds of hours of time and any amount of money
[12732.08s -> 12739.16s]  doesn't matter how much it would cost to make an FMV game that's like this but holy shit that
[12739.16s -> 12747.94s]  is like a monumental undertaking and there's no way I'm going to be able to do it there's only
[12747.94s -> 12755.43s]  so many things that can be in the tank you can't load up too much luggage in your car to the
[12755.43s -> 12761.35s]  point where your car is touching the ground because it won't drive yeah I can't weigh the
[12761.35s -> 12772.55s]  car down with 500 cinder blocks make that one the last bit before retirement all right
[12772.55s -> 12780.77s]  explore the seller it was there in the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil
[12780.77s -> 12785.57s]  grin I've actually talked about it before with people in the community about like things that
[12785.57s -> 12791.25s]  I've wanted to do but it's just I can't I get it's too much to think about too much to do
[12810.39s -> 12813.11s]  all right I mean we already know how this one plays out I probably just do this on my
[12817.96s -> 12825.78s]  own it's don't turn around and then we flip them he fell for it so I took the opportunity
[12825.78s -> 12832.98s]  to bash him in the chops I never hit a man when he's down but I knew I should have made
[12832.98s -> 12839.14s]  an exception when I felt his fingers on my throat how fucking awesome how fun would that be
[12842.66s -> 12851.17s]  man imagine making a full FMV game and we just do it when you guys play it like I don't
[12851.17s -> 12865.70s]  even play it you guys pick like this oh god damn it that would be fun yeah do it I don't tell me
[12865.70s -> 12875.06s]  to do these things because I will fuck up every other project just give me a little bit more
[12875.06s -> 12882.42s]  time I have a lot more things to talk about just a little bit more time um I want to do
[12882.42s -> 12889.28s]  so many of these things a little bit more time all right what are we doing all right
[12889.28s -> 12896.76s]  well Chad is deciding to lose another heart so uh we're going to tickle him he just tightened
[12896.76s -> 12912.87s]  his grip and laughed while you died I woke up with the feeling that I was at the end of my
[12912.87s -> 12921.73s]  rope it didn't work realized that I was you lost a heart the situation was bad and my life
[12921.73s -> 12927.99s]  hung in the balance but this was no time for reflection just make an unfinished FMV project and
[12927.99s -> 12935.01s]  have somebody else need to finish it in 30 years that's really funny well it would have
[12935.01s -> 12939.19s]  to be shot in 16 millimeter that's one of the things I'm going to make it really incredibly
[12939.19s -> 12946.77s]  incredibly clear if I'm if I were to do this it's being shot in 16 millimeter I don't care
[12946.77s -> 12962.50s]  how expensive it is this needs to be led that way it's going to be like two million dollars
[12962.50s -> 12972.15s]  fuck it I don't think it's gonna cost that much do 16 millimeter and then get it restored
[12973.11s -> 12983.76s]  wow now that's a big brain play that's a big brain play where'd you put somebody say cringe
[12983.76s -> 12988.00s]  all right uh we all we know this is easy all these are the same I was trying to think
[12988.00s -> 12998.68s]  of a diversion when I lost my footing the control started to slip away as the rope bit
[12998.68s -> 13007.25s]  into my neck have us pay for it do like a pay-per-view stream when I got up I saw that
[13007.25s -> 13015.22s]  the pipe had made quite an impression on laughing boy I wouldn't want to do okay here's what I
[13015.22s -> 13022.04s]  wouldn't want to do I wouldn't want to make it so people couldn't watch it even if that okay
[13022.04s -> 13025.64s]  let's say that this whole project if it was ever if it was ever done remember this is not
[13025.64s -> 13032.13s]  me saying it's happening I'm just saying that's I'm interested if it was oh here's an idea
[13032.13s -> 13036.96s]  we'll make the whole thing and then the stream will be you pay for the stream like a
[13036.96s -> 13043.24s]  pay-per-view stream no I want as many people to experience that as humanly possible
[13045.38s -> 13052.29s]  maybe do paid physical copies yeah I honestly I would not give a shit at all I mean obviously
[13052.29s -> 13057.62s]  I don't want to like lose like millions of dollars like that would be fucking devastating
[13057.62s -> 13063.80s]  I don't have millions of dollars that would be pretty bad maybe there's a way maybe
[13063.80s -> 13073.48s]  maybe I'll find a way all right what do you guys want to make yeah of course I told
[13073.48s -> 13078.84s]  laughing boy he was bound to be out of circulation for a while but he didn't
[13079.80s -> 13091.83s]  losing millions is really funny though no not really okay well all right this is where
[13091.83s -> 13105.28s]  it all goes completely off the rails what about getting it sponsored
[13106.50s -> 13117.59s]  yeah you don't know you're gonna get the sign it would need to be done with actors
[13118.39s -> 13137.92s]  shot on film I wanted to be old where we going I would make yourself an actor no I
[13137.92s -> 13141.44s]  would know I don't be the only actor I would be I would be in it for like 10 seconds
[13144.44s -> 13156.82s]  I'd be like the the old prospector that you run into like in a hallway somewhere
[13156.82s -> 13159.94s]  this is also pretty this is very unanimous look for some artifacts
[13162.71s -> 13167.67s]  the next room contained an old writing desk under the derhatchet family crest
[13167.67s -> 13179.96s]  on the desk were many items of interest did you get streamers to be actors no I don't
[13179.96s -> 13185.43s]  think so I don't want anyone I feel like okay I want them to be unknown I don't want
[13185.43s -> 13190.36s]  anyone to know who they are I wanted to be actors I wanted to be I'd like to be like
[13191.24s -> 13199.19s]  because here's the thing stuff like that would be really funny but let's just say it was like
[13199.19s -> 13206.79s]  streamer x it's no it's it's like streamer x playing character right it's not that's the
[13206.79s -> 13213.22s]  that's a monster on the screen so if I would ever do exactly the same reason why I said I
[13213.22s -> 13218.13s]  don't even want to be in it either like I would want to be in it for like 10 seconds
[13218.13s -> 13222.29s]  as like an easter egg I don't want to be in this I want to hire I want to like direct
[13222.29s -> 13228.07s]  actors right because then it's just oh look it's germa as this character you know I'm
[13228.07s -> 13235.96s]  saying so no it would be all just actors that we would be hiring and I'm talking like this is
[13235.96s -> 13246.48s]  happening soon but it's not if it did happen it would be like that all right uh taste the wine
[13247.28s -> 13252.85s]  we already know how to do this one we already know how to do this one why are you doing
[13252.85s -> 13263.17s]  this as I reached forward the candle lit itself and as if by magic a monk appeared
[13263.17s -> 13283.67s]  well this is a different option now play more of these games if you're a relatively new viewer
[13283.67s -> 13289.83s]  fold motion video games I've played almost all of them over the last five years or so
[13289.83s -> 13296.55s]  there actually aren't very many left that I haven't played some of the new ones I haven't
[13296.55s -> 13304.60s]  played the ones that have come out in the last year or two and we're going to be
[13304.60s -> 13310.12s]  dunk the flame in the wine oh yeah okay wish the candle and a glass of the house vino
[13310.12s -> 13318.40s]  and the phantom friar gave up the ghost at least the ones that looked like we'd have a good time
[13318.40s -> 13324.08s]  playing them right some fmv games that are very much meant to be taken very seriously
[13325.14s -> 13328.98s]  and it's not like oh my god look at how funny that was look at how bizarre of a scenario
[13328.98s -> 13332.74s]  that was it's just actors doing things in front of a camera so it's supposed to be
[13332.74s -> 13336.50s]  taken seriously and not like oh let's have a fun time and laugh at this
[13336.50s -> 13356.18s]  all right pocket the gold and split I think that's what it's going to be it is you guys
[13356.18s -> 13374.52s]  cannot make another mistake okay you want to go I don't want to say anything because it's
[13374.52s -> 13382.71s]  kind of close when is the baseball stream baseball stream is going to be at some point
[13382.71s -> 13391.68s]  in the first quarter or second quarter of next year somewhere when baseball is played
[13391.68s -> 13395.78s]  it was a theory that we might be able to get it done this year but it's not going
[13395.78s -> 13408.52s]  to happen too cold but that I refuse to not do that stream and what about grotto beasts
[13408.52s -> 13416.80s]  grotto beast actually let's do this right now I want to shout this out so grotto beasts I
[13416.80s -> 13422.24s]  can't give you a time or a date for that but I really really want you to be able to have
[13422.24s -> 13432.95s]  that stuff in your hands the physical cards in your hands by the latest quarter one of this
[13432.95s -> 13438.52s]  coming year I'm giving a huge window for that because it's very very possible that's
[13441.32s -> 13450.37s]  but I don't want to rush people on the work that they're doing so if you get it at some
[13450.37s -> 13456.21s]  point at the end of this year or January maybe you do but I'm not going to tell you that
[13456.21s -> 13460.13s]  because I don't want to put on just a dumb amount of pressure on people to have to get
[13460.13s -> 13465.51s]  stuff done that's I don't know I do not want to do that so whenever it's done
[13465.51s -> 13471.54s]  and whenever it's like okay it's ready to go and with that let's go ahead and talk about
[13471.54s -> 13484.64s]  this so the grotto beasts team as a twitter and they post various updates I actually just
[13484.64s -> 13497.99s]  retweeted them on Halloween here's the official grotto beasts twitter account let me put it in
[13497.99s -> 13504.20s]  the chat go give it a follow if you want to know more about grotto beast coming up
[13504.20s -> 13518.00s]  they post all the time all the various artists and here you go here is the official twitter of
[13518.00s -> 13529.19s]  the grotto beasts trading card game I was holding off on talking about this until it
[13529.19s -> 13539.76s]  was clear that we had sort of like an end goal of soon grotto beast nfts these are not nfts
[13539.76s -> 13546.39s]  but not there's not going to be an nft there won't be any grotto beast nfts this is you're
[13546.39s -> 13550.05s]  going to be able to hold these in your hand well not you get that it's a you're going to
[13550.05s -> 13559.73s]  be a whole it's cards you will be able to purchase and open for yourself packs of grotto
[13559.73s -> 13569.81s]  beasts by the way let's make this very clear too if you think that this was just going to
[13569.89s -> 13577.78s]  be a repackaged thing that I opened on the stream you are so wrong there's going to be
[13578.79s -> 13588.15s]  an astronomical more amount of cards and it's going to have a playable game behind it as well
[13588.15s -> 13596.08s]  you're actually going to be able to play this with people it's a real game have a game
[13596.08s -> 13603.70s]  designer and I hope you like it when it comes out because there's other stuff that I haven't
[13603.70s -> 13611.19s]  talked about yet with it too but you know what yeah fuck it let's just talk about it why
[13611.19s -> 13626.98s]  not hey I I'm the goddamn CEO okay um should I hold off on some stuff so the grotto beasts
[13626.98s -> 13636.02s]  card game is going to end up being a pretty significant uh when people talk about like
[13636.02s -> 13640.31s]  merch right oh what what should you do for merch should you do a t-shirt I could do
[13640.31s -> 13643.59s]  another t-shirt oh maybe I'll do a t-shirt maybe I'll do something else or maybe I'll
[13643.59s -> 13650.68s]  do like a toy or something in the grotto beast card game is going to be not just
[13650.68s -> 13660.48s]  grotto beasts it's not just going to be grotto beasts it's going to be tons and tons of this
[13660.48s -> 13673.94s]  channel's references characters it's going to be a gigantic crossover so it's not just simply
[13673.94s -> 13678.69s]  the grotto beasts there's potentially lots of other things too that you'll be able to have
[13678.69s -> 13690.69s]  and collect it's the biggest crossover event ever and it's two things that were created
[13691.17s -> 13698.08s]  on this same channel in this same community it's not even a crossover event it's the same goddamn
[13698.08s -> 13709.60s]  channel um so I've been pretty tight-lipped about this because I don't I didn't want to
[13709.60s -> 13714.23s]  like hype this up until I knew that it was going to start to become a thing so it's a
[13714.23s -> 13723.88s]  game you can actually play it you don't even have to he's losing viewers no stay don't please
[13723.88s -> 13731.88s]  don't leave please don't leave please what about people that were in the germa rumble
[13731.88s -> 13759.28s]  uh yes so that there's a lot of plans for like that project in the future maybe
[13760.58s -> 13767.24s]  just know that it's gonna have a lot of cards it's gonna be I don't want to talk too much
[13767.24s -> 13771.40s]  about it because I don't want to get anything wrong and community jake right now might be
[13771.40s -> 13776.08s]  fucking speed dialing me going like don't stop talking so I gotta be careful I don't
[13776.08s -> 13784.48s]  want to talk too much but follow that Twitter you're gonna get that's where

[13817.96s -> 13824.42s]  November they're gone all right let's go back to this what did you get I don't even know
[13824.42s -> 13845.86s]  what you guys picked this is a nice get rich scheme no this is it it's me selling you
[13845.86s -> 13873.04s]  card packs get rich more scheme all right settle down settle down real life gotcha no
[13873.04s -> 13879.54s]  we're gonna okay community jakes gonna scream at me I'm gonna get screamed at on the phone
[13879.54s -> 13887.86s]  um there's gonna it's gonna be don't worry okay no I'm gonna I'm okay let's go there's
[13887.86s -> 13898.53s]  no NFTs associated with this what the fuck um I never said that what about EU I do I don't
[13898.85s -> 13903.41s]  I have no answer for that time I don't I currently do not have an answer for this time
[13903.41s -> 13908.48s]  I'm I think so I just can't give you an answer I don't know I do not have an answer
[13908.48s -> 13914.12s]  for this time and my phone just blew up uh I've got eight unread notifications on my phone
[13915.62s -> 13923.94s]  uh I see a stop sign emoji a hundred times okay I probably should um let's go ahead and
[13923.94s -> 13943.20s]  play the game what did you guys pick it was a I don't remember it I can't it was b all
[13943.20s -> 13957.43s]  right b let's go on the steps above me a green ghoul gestured gracefully I'm really really
[13957.43s -> 13961.19s]  excited for not just the fact that the grotto beast are really awesome but it's going to
[13961.19s -> 13967.28s]  be this interesting kind of mix of like a ton of references to this the last decade plus
[13968.15s -> 13986.12s]  of this channel and community it's a really interesting way I was hopeful to do merch and
[13986.20s -> 13996.71s]  we're going a proceed boldly I approached the zombie reluctantly and asked him who his tailor
[13996.71s -> 14007.08s]  was his response was to push him backwards into a rickety old freight elevator yeah you said
[14017.40s -> 14021.64s]  you end up going to do the germa joke plus two minus two futures market with channel
[14021.64s -> 14032.29s]  points that seems like a fun idea yeah I did but that's the problem this is why I get into
[14032.29s -> 14040.21s]  trouble I get in a lot of trouble because we okay I tell I tell you guys about four or five
[14040.21s -> 14046.60s]  different things that sound really interesting don't they but in reality only one or two of
[14046.60s -> 14053.19s]  those things can possibly be worked on so what ends up happening is you are like oh my god
[14054.15s -> 14058.47s]  he talked about like four or five different cool things going on when in reality one of these
[14058.47s -> 14063.16s]  things is actually going to work these are all things that I really want to do every time I
[14063.16s -> 14071.04s]  talk it's things that I really want to do but here's the thing right since the dollhouse stream
[14073.35s -> 14083.06s]  there's been some potential here to do more possibly maybe hopefully maybe find more people
[14083.06s -> 14088.34s]  that are willing to get on board and help us pay for projects and help us do things
[14090.13s -> 14096.21s]  some of these things are possible now because the dollhouse happened and the dollhouse was a
[14096.21s -> 14101.96s]  really really fun time so I can't tell you exactly what's going to happen because I still
[14101.96s -> 14108.60s]  don't even know but if some of these doors are starting to open a little bit more with
[14108.60s -> 14115.25s]  like okay now people are aware that I want to do big projects and I need capital and I need
[14115.25s -> 14120.61s]  people and I need um more crew members and stuff right like this is all stuff that's
[14121.57s -> 14128.61s]  knowledgeable to a lot of people now so if I can get some of these things to help make
[14128.61s -> 14141.00s]  these projects come faster that's what I'm gonna do networking Andy well you bet your ass that
[14141.00s -> 14150.28s]  I want to try to make some of these things a reality right and if they do become a reality
[14150.28s -> 14154.88s]  that's what makes me happy I don't care about anything else I really don't I don't give a
[14154.88s -> 14160.00s]  shit about anything else I could not make a single dollar from any of the projects
[14160.00s -> 14166.05s]  none of them zero I would not give a flying fuck at all I wouldn't care at all I don't care
[14166.05s -> 14171.80s]  if they if the projects can be paid for and I don't have to worry about it then fucking
[14171.80s -> 14181.76s]  perfect that's exactly what I want I don't care he's lying by the way I'm not I swear
[14181.76s -> 14192.93s]  I promise you I don't care you've seen okay you've seen the leak I don't even need to
[14192.93s -> 14199.57s]  tell you that like we've made jokes about it before do I really need to make a shitload of money
[14199.57s -> 14219.91s]  on each project because I'm I have to no I don't care I'm for 98 yeah I'm not a liar says the
[14219.91s -> 14228.37s]  lie yeah all right I am a liar I'm a liar but not in not on important stuff like this I'm not
[14228.37s -> 14234.85s]  trying to make a bunch of money I'm trying to have things be paid for right that I'm
[14234.85s -> 14240.10s]  I hear about and sometimes people will hear about some of the how much some of this
[14240.10s -> 14248.15s]  these projects costed right holy shit it was that much money yeah I I it kind of sometimes
[14248.15s -> 14254.79s]  it has to be but don't get do not give me any money I'm seeing people give money don't do that
[14254.79s -> 14259.88s]  stop giving me money right now I demand it somebody's give me a hundred dollars
[14259.88s -> 14266.21s]  thank you for the do not do not give me any money stop that immediately I command it I
[14267.17s -> 14281.06s]  demand it it ends at once where we going stop reverse engineer Andy I'm just saying all right
[14281.06s -> 14288.68s]  just know in the future whatever projects we do I'm just I'm glad that they were able to happen
[14288.68s -> 14295.06s]  that's it just think about this thing this is like the kind of shit that I've wanted to do

[14318.40s -> 14323.94s]  and the fact that I'm able just to do that alone just just by itself is worth more than
[14323.94s -> 14332.79s]  anything anything so the fact that I can sit here and talk like this is already enough
[14332.79s -> 14352.98s]  just want to be clear Jesus fucking Christ just play the game already I just I just had a

[14435.19s -> 14445.57s]  walk straight this I don't think I've done this before the next room I came to had nothing
[14445.57s -> 14451.65s]  in it there was an old freezer on one side and a wall full of potions on the other
[14451.65s -> 14475.91s]  just as I started to examine them I heard a scream open the freezers the correct play
[14475.91s -> 14488.20s]  we've all seen it like five times already although there's opening the freezer stop
[14488.20s -> 14501.60s]  whatever the laughing screaming person coming in the room I think Coolsville sucks just open
[14501.60s -> 14520.37s]  the freezer ignoring the fumes I opened the freezer I love this guy uh can I just do this
[14520.37s -> 14541.49s]  on my own because I know how to get there please do okay hey man you don't want to be
[14541.49s -> 14550.42s]  messing with those chemicals man they're bad for your karma I read the labels extra strength
[14550.42s -> 14563.81s]  potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets okay uh so it's the take the steak leave
[14564.77s -> 14575.72s]  I wasn't hungry now but an instant steak might come in handy later where's your choice
[14575.72s -> 14584.55s]  that's what everybody was gonna pick all right this is it's a and then you leave these are
[14584.55s -> 14609.57s]  both this is gonna kill us so don't don't be don't be stupid about this thank you hey man
[14609.57s -> 14615.17s]  like I don't mean to be rude you know but like there's something in here that smells
[14615.25s -> 14619.65s]  almost worse than I do you know he did have a point
[14628.85s -> 14645.73s]  that noise at the end uh yeah we gotta get out of this room it's your one year
[14645.73s -> 14668.79s]  anniversary with the sus face I want a divorce I gave him five dollars and left all right
[14668.79s -> 14674.16s]  this is a tough call because I don't remember exactly which one of these means you get
[14674.16s -> 14696.00s]  grabbed but how do you feel about the rats becoming extremely popular and tiktok
[14696.00s -> 14701.83s]  sorry say that again say that one more time I didn't hear that that well say that again
[14701.83s -> 14713.08s]  I want you to say that again the rats are incredibly popular on tiktok the rats are
[14713.08s -> 14718.15s]  huge on tiktok excuse I'm sorry I'm leaning with my ear say that one more time what did
[14718.15s -> 14727.35s]  we talk about like a few weeks ago what that I I am huge on tiktok and I'm not even there
[14727.35s -> 14732.82s]  so I'm excuse me I'm just trying to understand why everyone was saying that
[14732.82s -> 14750.48s]  that was not accurate the rats are also huge on Facebook all right let's search the room the
[14750.48s -> 14759.40s]  rats are popular not you bozo as I ran into the next room I heard the scream
[14759.40s -> 14773.60s]  again I am the rats the rats are nothing without me should I make a tiktok video of
[14773.60s -> 14778.34s]  doing the rat song but make sure I'm doing it really poorly and I'd be pretty relatively
[14778.34s -> 14783.22s]  unknown on tiktok would people like hate me for it would be like oh that was terrible
[14783.22s -> 14788.36s]  nice try my video is way better on the tick on the rats meme it's like I'm I'm the one
[14788.36s -> 14799.12s]  who made it talking you talking to the guy that made it up keep moving forward why you're
[14799.12s -> 14807.86s]  not actually gonna do this are you I ran through the door and found myself near the elevator
[14807.86s -> 14813.78s]  oh I thought you fall I pushed the button and waited there was a green door to my left
[14813.78s -> 14819.59s]  and a stairway to my right okay I know for a fact that we don't do the green door
[14819.59s -> 14840.88s]  this is a really important decision but I'm just kidding I scramble up the stairs
[14841.44s -> 14858.63s]  is it time to release release release is it time to release the third rat song
[14858.63s -> 14873.97s]  I wonder if we're gonna get to the end at the top of the stairs I saw an ugly dwarf
[14880.61s -> 14896.64s]  private eye versus private eye gory how tall am I okay show them your license take evasive
[14896.64s -> 14914.82s]  action and put down that shovel take evasive action when he moved I jumped over the railing
[14915.86s -> 14920.34s]  it was a long way to the first floor and laughing boy was no help at all
[14924.31s -> 14933.86s]  that would hurt so bad holy shit that was painful looking I think you guys are in some
[14933.86s -> 14944.15s]  trouble here grab his shirt and pull punch with your stronger hand or let go of the
[14944.15s -> 14953.67s]  railing grab his shirt and pull is winning by a way too much I grabbed his shirt and he flipped
[14953.67s -> 14973.19s]  over the railing symbol crash the second floor looked dark and uninviting okay where we go I
[14973.19s -> 14980.92s]  told my friend who used to work with a company that helped with this game and he thought that
[14980.92s -> 14987.41s]  it was crazy that you were playing it I mean it's we're having a great time the last one
[14987.41s -> 14997.91s]  too I applaud the companies that actually tried to restore this stuff this is awesome
[14997.91s -> 15009.11s]  I'm having a lot of fun ask your friend how to beat the game all right we're going I don't know
[15009.11s -> 15021.65s]  it's 5142 a and c if it were me I would probably pick the one that we didn't do yet
[15021.65s -> 15025.65s]  which is probably whatever medical records so and that's winning right now so that's what
[15025.65s -> 15040.23s]  I'm gonna pick the room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort well kitchen
[15040.23s -> 15045.91s]  regardless I'm gonna get the garlic there was a door to my left another dead ahead
[15045.91s -> 15050.95s]  but most of the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right where someone was
[15050.95s -> 15062.77s]  practicing a bizarre form of culinary preparation but we don't necessarily have to do the kitchen
[15062.77s -> 15083.25s]  but the garlic seems pretty important huh yes the library kitchen I couldn't put my finger
[15083.25s -> 15088.36s]  on it but there was something odd about the woman in the kitchen if you're hungry get it
[15089.00s -> 15098.16s]  it's really cold in this room I think you see the breath coming out do you see that do you see just
[15098.16s -> 15111.67s]  how cold it is in there I feel bad for the actor uh yeah we look in the we're gonna look
[15111.67s -> 15134.53s]  in the fridge of course uh find other edibles we've gotten this right plenty of times
[15134.53s -> 15139.80s]  make the fmv game and make sure there's no references to you in it no there won't be
[15139.80s -> 15146.18s]  it would be it would be I mean well there'd be you'd probably know I made it somehow but
[15146.42s -> 15152.45s]  this would not be a like germa 985 fmv experience it'd be like an old western
[15152.45s -> 15163.59s]  game or something like an old horror game inside the cupboard was a rose a clove of garlic
[15163.59s -> 15185.96s]  and a couple of potatoes what are we doing don't tell us you made it and just play it one day
[15185.96s -> 15191.09s]  well I think it would be really fun if the first experience ever with the game
[15191.09s -> 15197.08s]  was on the stream and you guys are doing this maybe we'll build like an extension or
[15197.08s -> 15203.17s]  something I have like some kind of use of an extension for you guys to do it easier
[15203.17s -> 15211.09s]  so you guys will get the first experience of the game and then I reached in and took
[15211.09s -> 15219.64s]  the clove of god a week later or something it goes on steam or whatever stop giving him
[15219.64s -> 15237.40s]  the idea he only cares about money I care about money I don't only care about money
[15237.40s -> 15248.92s]  money's somewhere on the list somewhere take the potato I feel like I'm gonna get hurt
[15248.92s -> 15263.00s]  I you guys really I think A is you took too much die and we get stabbed
[15263.08s -> 15276.96s]  this is a gg I think yeah all right well
[15284.76s -> 15297.64s]  what the hell I came to here I am it's me I took all the things
[15298.68s -> 15306.60s]  was sitting across the attic from me at long last the detective decides to pay a bit
[15306.60s -> 15316.00s]  hypnotic effect this doesn't matter oh I feel like we've met before
[15318.66s -> 15325.86s]  you don't know me but I know you that's my favorite shot of the whole thing when he's
[15325.86s -> 15337.44s]  kind of leaned over you all said A anyways I want this guy it's something I picked out
[15337.44s -> 15349.27s]  close to your heart that was my blood he was sucking on this character okay this is
[15349.27s -> 15371.84s]  actually important I want that exact character in another game find something of value I should
[15371.84s -> 15391.11s]  have the coins quickly I checked my pockets okay throw a gold coin that's the only option
[15391.11s -> 15401.75s]  that probably results in something different that's a different video clip let's try it
[15401.75s -> 15409.25s]  I threw it in his mouth expecting him to choke to death what but instead
[15410.79s -> 15419.48s]  very tasty when I looked in his eyes I knew I had failed I was powerless to resist him
[15422.84s -> 15442.63s]  it was so stupid that sucked that sucked it was a great throw but Jesus okay you guys
[15442.71s -> 15453.96s]  want one more chance at this I'm gonna give you one more chance but let's get to the end
[15453.96s -> 15468.31s]  I know you can do it collectively I know you can is there another FMV I have this I have one more
[15468.31s -> 15473.19s]  that's ready for right now but it's new and I don't know I'm not sure if I want to do it
[15473.19s -> 15487.96s]  right now it looks like it might be long depends on how long it is is it the battle
[15487.96s -> 15504.39s]  royale one omega lol it is why are you saying that omega lol omega lol omega lol no
[15504.39s -> 15527.41s]  chance what do you mean fortnight is not an FMV dude it's short all right well let's try it

[15899.36s -> 15902.88s]  showrunners Alan Kroll claimed that all contestants are fully aware of
[15902.88s -> 15904.40s]  all right I know where I can get it I got it

[15914.48s -> 15917.76s]  career any problems these good problems you're right many would argue that the
[15917.76s -> 15921.68s]  corporation is abusing its position of power to take advantage of the destitute and are
[15921.68s -> 15926.96s]  responsible in large part for the cutthroat society we live in Eugene Kristoff when you
[15926.96s -> 15933.52s]  created the show you put the world's deadliest death row inmates on an island to battle to
[15933.52s -> 15938.00s]  the death the winners of the first few seasons have become some of the wealthiest people in
[15938.00s -> 15946.40s]  the world yes is that justice I guess I have what it took death or glory in the past few
[15946.40s -> 15951.83s]  years who do we play as have risen in line with the economic downturn what could do
[15951.83s -> 15956.07s]  everyone these people are a byproduct of the society created by you some would say

[15960.39s -> 15965.03s]  with applications they have been ground into dust by the boot heel of the rich and powerful
[15965.03s -> 15970.47s]  who are now using them for their own entertainment socialist mother if I didn't know
[15970.47s -> 15973.91s]  any better Chris I'd say you were accusing me of exploiting the poor I'm not the only
[15973.91s -> 15980.47s]  person to find your show utterly abhorrent have you ever fired before the terms are
[15980.47s -> 15984.79s]  agreed upon by both parties I've got to be playing a game to witness deaths on television
[15985.27s -> 15988.71s]  since the beginning of time man's been pitted against his fellow man in combat
[15988.71s -> 15994.15s]  surely we've evolved from a more barbaric time I'm not so sure we have
[16001.17s -> 16020.15s]  we play as one of these people people want they keep watching what the fuck they're like

[17574.63s -> 17583.52s]  my group yeah right look around they're out here they're probably hiding they did
[17587.25s -> 17593.52s]  yep and he had a gun thank you everybody wants to say i'm a psycho i just saved the
[17593.52s -> 17603.91s]  goddamn team this guy's fucking dead news guys this shit's fucking real it's fucking
[17603.91s -> 17618.79s]  real hesitation is defeat you know everyone's gonna come after you now in no time at all
[17619.43s -> 17631.86s]  now it's getting interesting no if everyone's look that's the thing if you landed away from
[17631.86s -> 17638.52s]  your group you're not going to hide behind a tree and approach another group choco boy 89
[17638.52s -> 17642.28s]  says it's a little landing not a chance in hell why would you sneak up on another group
[17642.28s -> 17650.28s]  that's not gonna happen i did what i had to do anything in camo camo's so in right now
[17650.28s -> 17659.60s]  really you never see it anywhere seriously though what is this shit these guns are almost antique
[17659.60s -> 17667.24s]  we should head for the center see that what about it it's got to be something it's not
[17667.24s -> 17673.16s]  in the muck exactly there's a bridge up ahead from there we can either go straight through
[17673.24s -> 17681.43s]  or we can go around i don't know straight ahead i feel like everyone's going to be going around
[17683.84s -> 17686.72s]  nobody wants to do the straight shot because as well it's too far in the open we don't want
[17686.72s -> 17702.44s]  to be too exposed but isn't everybody going to be going around i think it's straight on i say
[17702.44s -> 17708.18s]  we go straight through let's go see if we can catch someone off guard no we go the other way
[17708.82s -> 17716.77s]  yeah it makes sense we shouldn't say the risk are you serious i didn't just get telltale
[17716.77s -> 17721.81s]  did i have the trust of his teammates what's it gonna take to pull this back oh wait they
[17721.81s -> 17730.16s]  don't trust me it's actually a meter oh shit they won't listen to me that's actually kind of
[17730.16s -> 17741.40s]  interesting it's illusion of choice but it's not really an illusion of choice is this a team
[17741.40s -> 17745.56s]  morale meter and they would have listened to me if i if i didn't they didn't hate me or
[17745.56s -> 17755.78s]  something i don't know what's the difference between a liberal and a puppy a puppy stops
[17755.78s -> 17765.12s]  whining when it grows up landmine here comes the landmine or maybe they're gonna keep
[17765.12s -> 17769.60s]  them around long enough to like make everybody like hate him and then they'll kill him i don't

[18025.06s -> 18036.87s]  this is easy easy you took the good you took the good gun and didn't even use it oh
[18038.79s -> 18046.15s]  oh oh man i feel really bad i feel awful this is bad i need to redeem myself right now
[18046.79s -> 18064.32s]  where the fuck did they go i stop oh i don't know oh thank god streamer mode okay guys so
[18064.32s -> 18070.02s]  we got three seconds left and i gotta be honest i'm really not so sure what i should do
[18071.09s -> 18078.05s]  i'm thinking that gav has experience with potential uh survival skills but tish had
[18078.05s -> 18096.20s]  a lot of big brain ideas i'm not so certain about this though she had some i think she's
[18096.36s -> 18120.87s]  probably it's probably to keep the smart person tish tish suspects me oh shit she does you were
[18120.87s -> 18128.72s]  acting sus you've been acting sus towards tish if you save her then she should trust you again
[18128.72s -> 18148.08s]  but tish had a headshot that's right that's right um what but i feel like i haven't heard
[18148.08s -> 18156.60s]  very much from from gav in fact people saying who is gav so just because of that
[18157.16s -> 18162.88s]  i think we have to that's it
[18169.84s -> 18174.96s]  gav is not the annoying guy that's a good job i followed you down
[18175.60s -> 18182.58s]  i could work on the bridge there you really showed them it's your lucky day
[18186.05s -> 18193.81s]  dev the cannibal has cornered his own landing squad and that creative reuse of minds means
[18193.89s -> 18200.53s]  gav sees his final destination tish tasker and nick romeo he did get a headshot that was the
[18200.53s -> 18208.85s]  deciding factor for me that's what put me over the edge i forgot about her arms skills
[18215.72s -> 18232.84s]  tish led you to the bomb trap though looks like the mines they must have figured out
[18232.84s -> 18236.60s]  a way to reuse them the heck i might be impressed with my
[18236.60s -> 18241.96s]  ears stop ringing oh shit she's injured see what happened to the others i didn't see shit
[18242.68s -> 18251.32s]  i think scarlet went down and you shoot out though where are we oh thank god we're five
[18251.32s -> 18260.82s]  miles inland you should have stayed with auto fuck yeah well look what is it he said he was
[18260.82s -> 18277.43s]  a camper he okay got louder i just turned it over this it kills me turn that off why
[18278.23s -> 18286.07s]  you are too though well if somebody wants to decide on taking me over somebody else then
[18286.07s -> 18290.55s]  you know not to take the camper you know it's great to be part of a real team i think you
[18290.55s -> 18320.63s]  made the right choice fucking jesus christ good woman what the fuck stop what's wrong with
[18320.71s -> 18334.76s]  everybody now you're a star you gotta shoot everybody over here sorry shoot everybody
[18335.72s -> 18361.75s]  is she's alive what's going on zombie what the fuck we hear a kill stream would like to
[18361.75s -> 18367.52s]  apologize to scarlet's friends and family let's take a moment now in remembrance of her life
[18368.77s -> 18379.96s]  moving on i'm glad i got the mature stream warning on this one holy fucking moly looks
[18380.60s -> 18408.24s]  that was fast we saw where his heart was right at the christopher that was fucking scarring yeah
[18408.24s -> 18423.06s]  that was fucking horrible like forever changed from that one let's stop watching tv you've also
[18423.06s -> 18460.87s]  broadened it out actually good effects though not very realistic but pretty good i mean that
[18460.87s -> 18483.14s]  was fucked up you want another drink yeah how many people are even left on our team
[18485.20s -> 18495.89s]  nick slow down let's take a breather there's something up ahead can we please stop playing
[18495.89s -> 18515.80s]  this um i mean there's only two of us left what what what are you looking for you need to tell
[18515.80s -> 18530.61s]  me what's going on that headcase ari was almost right throw for content i actually have not
[18531.17s -> 18537.25s]  about that but this game is fixed what do you mean winners picked out before the game begins
[18538.05s -> 18545.68s]  how guns are real the mines are real how could you possibly stop someone from getting killed
[18545.68s -> 18548.56s]  it's not a sure thing but from what we can tell what are you saying it's fake
[18551.76s -> 18559.52s]  i'm too speed i'm not here to win tish you need to stop i've been sent here by a group
[18559.52s -> 18566.55s]  called the alliance they've sent me here to expose the truth that the corporation used
[18566.55s -> 18573.08s]  deep fake technology to rig the outcome of kill street with a deep fake stuff computer
[18573.08s -> 18577.88s]  generated scenarios they can alter the broadcast in real time to make things play out the way
[18577.88s -> 18583.32s]  they want why why can't they just let it play out the winner's a puppet all the fame
[18583.32s -> 18587.00s]  and power that come from winning this thing can be controlled if they know who the winner is
[18587.64s -> 18592.20s]  alan corp are fucked they've been hemorrhaging money for years they're on the deep faking people
[18592.20s -> 18596.84s]  dying cost of running this meat grinder adds up the bribes the countries that host it the
[18596.84s -> 18602.52s]  jurisdictions that broadcast it the lawsuits from the contestants estates them with audiences
[18602.52s -> 18607.48s]  dwindling they had to come up with a plan so they started fixing it we're not sure when
[18607.48s -> 18612.69s]  but when the creator left their big changes behind the scenes the winners always became big
[18612.85s -> 18617.33s]  all the way up to the top and then all the way to the top man decided to change that
[18617.89s -> 18621.57s]  with the winners in their pockets they managed to keep things afloat for a while longer
[18621.57s -> 18625.57s]  but now they're getting desperate that's why the rules keep getting more brutal
[18626.29s -> 18632.37s]  so you were being serious about the no tap ups they're doing it to boost the ratings
[18633.88s -> 18642.64s]  and the puppet who is it i'm not sure yet it's him sure it's um it's i'm the bad guy
[18642.64s -> 18646.96s]  probably right it's me who's i talking to on the phone before on the walkie-talkie
[18652.23s -> 18658.85s]  it's me it's gonna be me you're here to expose all of this how why do you be like
[18664.45s -> 18671.62s]  not bad and send you let's just say i have a reason to hate alan corp we're all getting
[18671.62s -> 18676.74s]  deep faked the alliance knew this and it was a safe bet my this is the last thing i'm playing
[18676.74s -> 18682.10s]  before i'm starting streaming they gave me this device a payload that i need to plant in the
[18682.10s -> 18688.18s]  corporation's network if they can get in they can hijack the stream expose it all the deep fakes the
[18688.18s -> 18694.50s]  fix everything so why are you telling me this why isn't the alliance helping you who's the
[18694.50s -> 18698.82s]  no something goes up they switched locations at the last moment who's the known animal
[18700.50s -> 18708.18s]  last dream ever what no i'm saying just for today what about gps our phones blocked
[18708.18s -> 18711.38s]  this all signals in and out of this place go through alan corp's network
[18712.56s -> 18717.04s]  we're almost done ice was meant to be vulnerable to their control but the blast back there must
[18717.04s -> 18722.64s]  have knocked it out i need to find a way in the alan corp's network a comms tower maybe
[18722.64s -> 18726.88s]  i can find a way to get a message out we can find out where the fuck they're going to kill
[18726.88s -> 18731.68s]  you gotta be something i didn't say this was bad they're streaming from all these drones 24
[18731.68s -> 18737.48s]  seven let me see that even if the radio is broken we should be able to get some info from
[18737.48s -> 18744.47s]  the storage i'm not dying on this fucking island for nothing do i do i trust her what do you think
[18748.36s -> 18754.90s]  i don't know i don't think so i'm gonna keep hold of it for now they keep just doing the
[18754.90s -> 18766.85s]  double cross thing no okay it's getting dark if there is a predetermined winner it could be
[18766.85s -> 18785.59s]  anyone you have another tower then we know that so what if it's just her we should take it
[18785.59s -> 18790.47s]  in turns keeping watch and tell them to stop cursing please toss a point no need
[18791.67s -> 18795.43s]  you're concerned about cursing you sure and there was just like a gruesome scene with
[18795.43s -> 18802.24s]  somebody's like face like blown off may as well have the conversation how'd you end up here
[18803.28s -> 18813.49s]  that's complicated answer why not not much call for an aging child actor i didn't make the
[18813.49s -> 18822.48s]  transition you bleep the swears sure tv and film that all changed i will do that for you
[18823.60s -> 18829.35s]  reality killed the tv store while you're breaking my heart mikey
[18833.06s -> 18840.04s]  you blame the corporation for that you missed it you remember the other nick
[18841.75s -> 18849.01s]  nicky murk you guys do like a double f for one what we're doing on a shelf life
[18849.57s -> 18858.37s]  this hollywood chews you up and spits you out when you do anything you can to stay on top i'm
[18858.37s -> 18866.68s]  waiting i'm trying to get it so he did kill stream season six it's all starting to make
[18866.68s -> 18878.55s]  sense drinking drugs made him a different person made him feel invincible he thought
[18878.63s -> 18892.80s]  this was the only way out deep fake it is for some of us i'm sorry i didn't mean
[18911.75s -> 18916.15s]  someone tipping the scales so here i am
[18916.55s -> 18923.83s]  um the ad revenue for my channel since i've been in here that's gotta be something for them right
[18925.59s -> 18937.92s]  what do they think of all this i told them be hard for them to miss by now though
[18942.72s -> 18948.16s]  oh my god all right this i haven't had a complaint about this game until right now
[18949.84s -> 18955.92s]  this is way too long you're sleeping in the subway station i thought you didn't watch those
[18955.92s -> 18963.06s]  movies come on they were everywhere when i was a kid of course they were to those movies

[19173.78s -> 19179.48s]  goddamn lame stream media and their goddamn witch hunts i mean so what if you took a bus
[19179.48s -> 19188.85s]  out of school kids hostage you only killed the teacher you're sure you saw something
[19188.85s -> 19196.21s]  i thought i might have seen an antenna okay what's this about an antenna oh don't even think
[19196.21s -> 19201.73s]  about it no we were wrong i'm sorry i was very wrong six could taking you both down
[19201.73s -> 19206.21s]  then why didn't you douchebag the math like that just might auto i'm so sorry
[19206.69s -> 19214.10s]  hey can we start over you were listening we need to work together that's not what you said to me
[19214.10s -> 19222.05s]  last time we met look i'm so sorry you said you were a camper in um call of duty whatever it
[19222.05s -> 19231.84s]  was there's more going on here than you know lower the gun let's talk camping is a really
[19231.84s -> 19238.15s]  good strategy it keeps your kill death high you get to enjoy the game you can eat a
[19238.15s -> 19241.73s]  sandwich while you're playing you don't have to have two hands the controller i mean that's
[19241.73s -> 19247.73s]  a pain in the ass what's the difference between this island and a dead prostitute
[19254.07s -> 19261.28s]  uh auto hears me saying auto and is walking over here now hello auto well it's a different
[19261.28s -> 19274.12s]  auto not you this island still sucks now we get a new party why don't get is if they can
[19274.12s -> 19278.76s]  fake bits of it why not fake the whole thing why bother going to the expense of hosting it
[19278.76s -> 19287.33s]  in the first place so let's let's get auto involved here too many variables all the drama
[19287.33s -> 19293.33s]  power struggles randomness of people is hard to script plus i don't know whether you notice but
[19294.45s -> 19299.89s]  seriously cutting you want 50 auto cam 50 game that everybody apparently hates that i'm streaming
[19300.61s -> 19303.89s]  that and there's just too many people involved by the time i start fixing this shit
[19304.93s -> 19308.69s]  trust a handful of people at the top to stay quiet they've got the most to lose
[19309.41s -> 19311.97s]  the winner's gonna keep their mouth shut but what about everyone else
[19312.69s -> 19319.44s]  let's see if i can get it so who is it you know the puppet the winners ari seems to think it was all
[19319.44s -> 19324.48s]  fake you know he really believed it maybe he was onto something maybe it's you mysteriously
[19324.48s -> 19329.28s]  popping up after an explosion one foot in one foot out of the group seems a bit suspicious
[19331.28s -> 19335.12s]  could be anyone he needs something i've got my suspicions but he's hungry
[19335.20s -> 19338.48s]  no you hungry fingers it could be more than one for all we know
[19342.52s -> 19346.04s]  west i'm gonna take them out and give them a little snack and then that's where i saw the
[19346.04s -> 19351.64s]  building 50 auto my promise has to be something so you get to a part where i can freeze it
[19352.76s -> 19358.04s]  there you go all right uh this is gonna be the last brb of the night i'll be right back
[19358.90s -> 19594.21s]  and then we'll have a 50 auto cam let's see how if the auto cam will work auto cam okay um
[19594.21s -> 19625.08s]  if he sits down let's see i don't 50 auto cam okay well you want you can't see the game
[19625.08s -> 19648.28s]  okay can you see the game cooking down to the final 10 who cares about the game this tension
[19648.28s -> 19654.44s]  with a spoon nick romeo is still and what do you think in your party maybe there's still hope
[19655.08s -> 19661.48s]  maybe the pieces are just too small this is strange they're not showing anything
[19661.48s -> 19669.51s]  bullshit what the fuck is going on the show's really gone downhill oh the show's gone downhill
[19670.63s -> 19675.59s]  that's two clicks west just past those trees past the mines we're just gonna get through
[19675.59s -> 19681.00s]  the field isn't there another way around the river mines around the island is 200 meters
[19681.00s -> 19688.68s]  oh no i don't this open ground it gives us an advantage so you're on like a bright red blanket
[19688.68s -> 19693.16s]  how can someone who joined this is way too suddenly be so risk averse it doesn't contrast
[19693.16s -> 19698.44s]  well at all i don't know it's better than fumbling around in the dark just hoping to come
[19698.44s -> 19705.24s]  across something okay what are our options well there's one thing that i think might live
[19705.24s -> 19710.76s]  auto reaction go on well you said those guys use the mines to blow up the bridge
[19710.76s -> 19714.44s]  yeah that means one of those assholes has figured out how to rig those mines to blow
[19714.44s -> 19719.00s]  up on command that means it can be hacked if they can be hatched figure out how they're
[19719.88s -> 19727.32s]  itchy head so what we take a live mine and deactivate oh he's hitting his ear that sounds
[19727.32s -> 19733.16s]  like it's gonna take forever not only for the first one these mines are smart which means
[19733.16s -> 19738.28s]  it's probably part of a mesh network they send a signal to arm disarm from mine to mine
[19739.08s -> 19743.48s]  if i can figure out how to break one of these guys security i can maybe disarm the whole
[19743.48s -> 19751.32s]  thing at least the area we're in wow that sounds like a long shot okay then fuckers

[20301.46s -> 20308.44s]  sacrifice but here's the thing what if they're baking this up what if they're working together
[20308.44s -> 20322.24s]  this could just be an elaborate ruse this is an elaborate ruse they're working i knew it i told
[20322.24s -> 20336.74s]  you yep what are you doing we need him god damn it i knew it he won't get far no no
[20337.54s -> 20348.64s]  i know where he's going i've been looking forward to this we had the we had the redemption
[20348.64s -> 20367.68s]  arc too but you needed a helpful man to take me down this is the end for otto blakely
[20367.68s -> 20373.20s]  necro to his fans and now just plain necrotic to the rest okay so now what
[20373.76s -> 20375.68s]  what is the climax of this whole thing right
[20386.42s -> 20432.60s]  you're just at the beginning your face on autos he's using the webcam i can't do that
[20448.93s -> 20466.16s]  okay i thought he was just saying he wanted to take a bath i wasn't paying too much attention
[20466.16s -> 20474.55s]  okay so what happens here how does this end the acting that acting is not even bad was
[20475.19s -> 20478.23s]  that was like good acting that wasn't bad acting what are you talking about
[20478.87s -> 20495.11s]  i mean some of the acting is not good is not good
[20505.43s -> 20516.84s]  you know you think he's a bad actor i think that guy's pretty good where the
[20516.84s -> 20522.28s]  fuck have you been i got this so wrong i thought this guy was gonna die first and
[20522.28s -> 20552.16s]  they kept him through the whole game like comedy relief guy yeah stealth takedown
[20552.16s -> 20561.84s]  how do you do a stealth takedown if somebody's looking at you i don't know
[20561.84s -> 20596.61s]  how i got over here what yeah search where'd the knife come from i don't remember it was makeup
[20598.58s -> 20611.30s]  oh no i don't think so what do you mean it was makeup all right dad it's makeup yeah

[20636.61s -> 20687.09s]  another gun upgrade nice go go get in there hurry nick let's talk we can still get on the
[20687.09s -> 20705.96s]  blur and get this all sorted you awake again okay but we're almost there the finale wait what
[20705.96s -> 20714.44s]  what chance do you think you had you fucking muppet see the decision's already been made
[20714.44s -> 20720.84s]  okay but i'm still alive oh the deep fakes are out there as far as the world knows you're
[20720.84s -> 20732.28s]  already dead i can easily just show up and be alive they can't let you there will be
[20732.28s -> 20740.66s]  survivors one survivor anyway oh my god i can't believe he just showed that what the fuck why
[20740.66s -> 20758.76s]  don't remember that happening everyone gets shot through their right eye by the way now what
[20758.76s -> 20766.87s]  put the gun down tish so we made it to the last two that's not true doesn't have to end
[20766.87s -> 20772.47s]  this what about what about the girl the blood in her mouth lived through this maybe she just
[20772.55s -> 20782.37s]  dipped out there are no guarantees what then this right here is the ultimate prize nick
[20782.37s -> 20789.27s]  that's bullshit you just don't get it do you you may have lost your fame your fortune your
[20789.27s -> 20796.15s]  friend but it's just seven times i never had any of that to begin with i came here for
[20796.15s -> 20802.23s]  my family and now i can have it all the hell with everyone else you can't change it nick
[20802.95s -> 20808.39s]  we gotta look out for ourselves there's a better way we can put an end to all this bloodshed you
[20808.39s -> 20815.81s]  are better than this tish you don't know me who i am you still have a choice i never had a choice
[20815.81s -> 20832.32s]  nick don't do it your move fine don't make me do it don't make me do it please tish never
[20832.32s -> 20835.76s]  point a gun at something you don't intend to kill oh you didn't intend to kill me okay well
[20836.71s -> 20864.47s]  never mind
[20894.98s -> 20904.64s]  the broadcast is out you're dead anyway not if i skip the ending cut scene i can do my own deep
[20904.64s -> 20943.09s]  fake chaotic laughter do i live do i survive that that's probably a really bad ending
[20943.57s -> 20953.88s]  oh it's gonna be after credits it's a battle royale you want but i didn't win though
[20954.44s -> 20964.13s]  because they fake the whole thing with cg characters like one of the characters was
[20964.13s -> 20968.85s]  saying earlier what is the point of even doing this show if you can just have realistic
[20970.23s -> 20975.99s]  completely uncanny valley real people cg of people doing this what's the point of doing
[20975.99s -> 20992.18s]  this in real life that might be the worst ending it could be it's probably at least
[20992.18s -> 21016.56s]  like five endings the full screen auto well hold on not yet in one of the other endings
[21016.56s -> 21027.19s]  you hack the stuff and release the deep fake info oh okay all right let's get the credits and see
[21027.19s -> 21064.52s]  what happens there's nothing there is it it's it no morale nobody likes me nobody loves me
[21064.52s -> 21080.26s]  but i'm strong and smart i guess no one likes me but i'm very strong and very smart
[21080.82s -> 21100.29s]  okay decisions made 54 scenes viewed this 294 scenes holy shit damn okay no romances all right
[21100.29s -> 21106.12s]  uh i'm gonna do one thing before we go there's a short video i want to watch it's a short
[21106.12s -> 21114.93s]  sorcery film about this stream and the sorcery game uh but the stream is essentially over
[21115.65s -> 21124.29s]  next time i'll be live will likely be next weekend probably on either friday or saturday
[21124.29s -> 21131.46s]  or sunday keep an eye on the sus likely sunday either maybe friday and sunday or maybe just sunday

[21186.31s -> 21194.84s]  i grab it but that's going to conclude essentially the gaming portion of the stream and i think this
[21194.84s -> 21201.28s]  video is like you two three minutes four minutes something like that those who have never seen
[21201.28s -> 21208.29s]  the sorcery playthrough is one of the first streams i really did on twitch when i went

[21334.90s -> 21340.10s]  something on the ground just in front of him you glance upwards to the stars and suddenly
[21340.10s -> 21348.13s]  the old man shouts her sorcerer i knew it you're mistaken you reply cautiously oh i don't think so
[21348.85s -> 21354.29s]  you'll get us out of here better yet i haven't played anyone for months silly not anyone smart

[21721.75s -> 21728.71s]  like it's it sits in a place for me where i want to preserve that i had so much fun it was such
[21728.71s -> 21734.69s]  a it was so many fun streams in a row that i don't want to go back and remake it i feel
[21734.69s -> 21746.08s]  like it wouldn't be as interesting maybe sensory stream yeah i know i got there's a lot of
[21746.08s -> 21759.68s]  stuff that i'm going to be working on this week maybe i'll go tap into that too uh that
[21759.68s -> 21769.51s]  was a lot of fun all three of those games had um interesting things to experience although
[21769.51s -> 21775.59s]  holy shit man i still i'm like still thinking of that lady in her like mouth i'm gonna need

[21835.80s -> 21842.00s]  did some reorganization and one of the things i realized i was like what are these i i bought
[21842.00s -> 21845.68s]  these like years ago with the intent on doing like a video on them or streaming them i just
[21845.68s -> 21857.60s]  never did at least that one i bought that one i know at least six months ago when did
