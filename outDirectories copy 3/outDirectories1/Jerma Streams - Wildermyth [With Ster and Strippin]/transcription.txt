[3.13s -> 4.33s]  All right, let's go.
[4.33s -> 6.01s]  Okay. All right. Welcome to.
[9.02s -> 9.74s]  Welcome, everybody.
[9.74s -> 15.37s]  Welcome to filter myth. A tale of dragons and danger.
[15.37s -> 17.29s]  And guess what? I'm like five minutes early.
[17.29s -> 18.81s]  It said somewhere around 12 to one.
[19.77s -> 20.73s]  Let's go. Here we are.
[20.73s -> 21.69s]  Hi, everybody.
[21.69s -> 24.25s]  How do you got a character in mind?
[24.25s -> 25.85s]  Do we have like a whole race selection?
[26.57s -> 26.89s]  I don't know.
[27.61s -> 28.81s]  We're going to make our character.
[28.81s -> 30.01s]  Your character is important.
[30.57s -> 32.17s]  We can either randomize our characters,
[32.17s -> 33.53s]  but I think it might be better if we make them.
[34.81s -> 35.45s]  I think that's fun.
[38.62s -> 39.74s]  Oh, I got to tweet this too.
[40.30s -> 43.80s]  Okay. We got a couple options here.
[46.06s -> 47.82s]  We have the age of old tricks.
[47.82s -> 48.54s]  I think we should do that.
[48.54s -> 50.30s]  That's like the standard campaign.
[51.18s -> 52.78s]  Let's go with that.
[52.78s -> 53.74s]  Sounds good.
[53.74s -> 54.46s]  How do you spell this?
[55.34s -> 56.46s]  Wilder.
[56.46s -> 59.91s]  Is it not on the top left of your screen right now?
[62.78s -> 65.98s]  Yeah, dude, I'm looking down at my phone and I'm like,
[67.18s -> 68.06s]  how do you spell it?
[68.70s -> 70.30s]  Oh, there it is.
[70.30s -> 73.38s]  Okay. Wilder myth sounds fun.
[74.58s -> 75.86s]  Okay, let's go.
[75.86s -> 81.80s]  Okay. Right.
[81.80s -> 84.12s]  So you guys should, you guys see the screen right now?
[84.12s -> 84.76s]  Yes.
[84.76s -> 89.18s]  Okay. So we're going to allocate one, two, three.
[89.90s -> 92.30s]  You guys are now in control of your characters.
[92.30s -> 93.66s]  So you want to, you can click them
[94.30s -> 96.06s]  and you can start customizing.
[96.06s -> 97.14s]  Oh, okay.
[97.86s -> 98.98s]  So the top left.
[98.98s -> 101.22s]  I clicked randomize once and I'm happy.
[101.22s -> 103.46s]  Okay. So the top left, you can scroll along
[103.46s -> 106.10s]  and you can kind of like auto people.
[108.14s -> 112.22s]  And then you've got like the bottom left is the most important
[112.22s -> 113.90s]  and this is probably why you don't want to randomize stuff
[113.90s -> 117.34s]  is because you need to customize your like aspects.
[117.98s -> 120.54s]  His name is Alunga and it looks like me.
[121.42s -> 122.62s]  Like I'm done.
[122.62s -> 123.42s]  I don't even have a chat.
[123.42s -> 124.78s]  Okay. You don't want to customize
[124.78s -> 126.54s]  like any aspect of his personality.
[126.54s -> 129.56s]  You happy with him?
[130.81s -> 133.29s]  Oh, okay. There's a whole, there's a huge thing here.
[133.29s -> 134.23s]  Okay.
[134.23s -> 136.87s]  Yeah. So the bit you're going to, you can,
[136.87s -> 138.55s]  if you want to write a backstory, you can.
[138.55s -> 141.51s]  That normally the randomly generated ones are pretty funny.
[141.51s -> 142.84s]  Okay.
[142.84s -> 145.40s]  And then the biggest thing is you go to history
[145.94s -> 148.02s]  and you can pick like three traits.
[149.88s -> 155.37s]  So you can pick like, you know, potential library and brash.
[155.93s -> 158.38s]  So this is pretty detailed then.
[158.38s -> 160.62s]  Yeah. And like picking all this stuff will determine
[161.90s -> 166.18s]  like it will determine like your character interactions,
[166.18s -> 167.86s]  how he behaves, what might happen to him,
[167.86s -> 170.66s]  the decisions he'll make all that stuff.
[170.66s -> 178.01s]  Is there, where does your class come in?
[178.01s -> 183.14s]  Like that comes in later.
[183.14s -> 188.74s]  So essentially this is a RPG DND AI roguelike
[188.74s -> 191.70s]  that we're going to be playing and it's in the same realm.
[191.70s -> 192.57s]  Yeah.
[193.51s -> 195.75s]  I just turned my stream on and I haven't been talking so.
[195.75s -> 197.43s]  Yeah. Relationship simulator.
[197.43s -> 198.38s]  Okay.
[198.38s -> 201.34s]  So there will be combat.
[201.34s -> 203.66s]  It'll be kind of like tactics based.
[203.66s -> 205.74s]  If you've played like a Final Fantasy tactics or game like that,
[205.74s -> 212.39s]  it's like, it'll be like a top down, like hex board.
[212.39s -> 214.39s]  And then the combat's pretty fun.
[215.61s -> 218.01s]  But between the combat will be long periods of story
[218.01s -> 220.89s]  and what we'll do is we'll voice our own characters
[220.89s -> 223.69s]  and the AI will generate our dialogue and our.
[223.69s -> 224.09s]  Really?
[224.09s -> 224.97s]  And what happens.
[224.97s -> 225.96s]  Yeah.
[225.96s -> 227.16s]  Why have I never heard of this game?
[227.16s -> 229.24s]  That sounds, that sounds, this sounds amazing.
[229.24s -> 231.96s]  It's such a charming game, but like not many people have heard.
[231.96s -> 233.22s]  Okay.
[233.78s -> 235.14s]  Yeah. I kind of forgot about it.
[235.14s -> 240.02s]  I'm like a youth.
[240.02s -> 240.52s]  Yeah.
[240.52s -> 242.18s]  Currently locked in.
[242.18s -> 247.85s]  So if right now we've got Starr is the hunter
[247.93s -> 249.53s]  and Gemma is the mystic.
[249.53s -> 250.25s]  Wait, where am I?
[250.25s -> 251.46s]  I am the warrior.
[251.46s -> 254.18s]  See where it says at the top, future warrior, hunter and mystic.
[254.18s -> 255.38s]  Where do you change that?
[257.46s -> 259.30s]  If you don't want to be a hunter.
[259.30s -> 260.90s]  I don't know if you can change it.
[264.38s -> 266.46s]  I'm cool with being the mage.
[266.46s -> 268.57s]  That's cool with me.
[268.57s -> 271.98s]  If you want to be the warrior though so we can swap.
[271.98s -> 278.01s]  Oh, no, I think it just gives you one of each
[278.01s -> 279.88s]  and then we can assign them.
[279.88s -> 283.50s]  Is there a hair, a hair color?
[283.50s -> 287.02s]  Normally we can pick them, but this is like the base campaign.
[287.02s -> 287.98s]  So it's kind of like.
[287.98s -> 288.38s]  Oh, okay.
[288.46s -> 289.82s]  So this is a tutorial too.
[289.82s -> 297.99s]  So we like locked in.
[297.99s -> 298.31s]  All right.
[298.31s -> 299.43s]  I think, I think that's wait.
[299.43s -> 300.87s]  Should I have a beard or something?
[300.87s -> 303.78s]  All right.
[303.78s -> 304.26s]  That's good.
[305.13s -> 309.14s]  No, that's good.
[309.14s -> 309.86s]  I did my history.
[309.86s -> 310.98s]  What did you guys do for your history?
[313.02s -> 314.62s]  Can you write it?
[314.62s -> 315.82s]  Yeah, you can if you want.
[315.82s -> 320.52s]  Oh, no, I was talking about the like the three drop downs.
[320.52s -> 328.26s]  Yeah, I'm going to do destiny, shame, but also.
[332.22s -> 335.98s]  I did dreamer, clown and nostalgic.
[337.56s -> 338.76s]  That yeah, that sounds like you.
[339.64s -> 341.08s]  I thought you said streamer.
[343.08s -> 343.56s]  Streamer.
[347.24s -> 347.64s]  Oh, shit.
[347.64s -> 347.96s]  All right.
[347.96s -> 350.44s]  I think so is the names are here.
[352.07s -> 352.71s]  Yeah, I'm excited.
[352.71s -> 353.67s]  This is going to be fun.
[353.67s -> 366.31s]  Is there any other customizations?
[366.31s -> 366.79s]  We should.
[366.79s -> 369.67s]  Jesus, are there any other customers?
[369.67s -> 371.83s]  The way they said that, like, oh my goodness.
[371.83s -> 375.66s]  Are there any other customizations that we can do?
[375.66s -> 381.05s]  I think you get more if we.
[381.05s -> 383.85s]  This is like just the first campaign to kind of show you the ropes.
[383.85s -> 386.33s]  Oh, we can do hair color and everything like that.
[386.33s -> 387.93s]  Yeah, you can do hair color and all that kind of stuff.
[392.28s -> 396.84s]  The main thing is the three the three aspects in history is like important.
[396.84s -> 400.04s]  And then if you got to customize, you've got like size, color,
[400.04s -> 401.48s]  head and face and then your name.
[404.52s -> 409.19s]  Man, if you could do character creator before you were born,
[409.19s -> 411.78s]  how long would you spend in it?
[411.78s -> 412.58s]  Days.
[412.58s -> 414.33s]  That sounds like weird.
[415.05s -> 417.82s]  Wait, would you just hit the randomize button?
[417.82s -> 421.02s]  No, I just named my character Smushman, but it was just like, I don't know.
[422.66s -> 423.86s]  I already have that character name.
[425.02s -> 425.98s]  Nine months.
[425.98s -> 428.22s]  Yeah, you got nine months of character creation.
[428.22s -> 429.02s]  Yeah, that's true.
[430.28s -> 433.72s]  What if like you had nine months and then like you were one day
[433.72s -> 436.36s]  from the nine month limit and you accidentally hit like randomize
[436.36s -> 439.40s]  and everything, all your hard work was just like undone, like bam.
[442.25s -> 443.77s]  Oh, I forgot to save.
[445.26s -> 446.22s]  Oh, that's not good.
[447.50s -> 457.32s]  I'm just going to get born like that name in dogwood details.
[457.32s -> 457.96s]  OK, all right.
[457.96s -> 460.12s]  Well, this is just a trial run we're doing, right?
[460.92s -> 462.76s]  Yeah. Yeah, let's go.
[462.76s -> 465.24s]  No, this is literally who you will be for the rest of your life.
[465.24s -> 465.96s]  OK, let's go.
[469.86s -> 472.34s]  Welcome to Wildermyth.
[472.98s -> 477.94s]  OK, so the best way to do this is like one person will kind of be in control of
[478.82s -> 480.34s]  when we go to the next slide.
[480.90s -> 481.22s]  OK.
[481.22s -> 484.50s]  If either of you want to be that guy or you just want me to do it and then
[486.38s -> 487.26s]  kind of read along.
[489.40s -> 491.08s]  I'm not ready for that responsibility.
[491.08s -> 494.04s]  I think somebody should be like the bookkeeper.
[494.04s -> 495.08s]  I'll be the guy.
[495.08s -> 497.80s]  If you guys click read along with leader, that checkbox,
[498.94s -> 500.78s]  then it will bring you with me.
[500.78s -> 501.18s]  Perfect.
[501.74s -> 503.40s]  Oh, we have our own little mouses.
[504.41s -> 505.05s]  Yeah.
[505.05s -> 507.13s]  So did you see the change page?
[507.13s -> 507.69s]  Yep.
[507.69s -> 512.30s]  OK, there's room in it for another story.
[513.02s -> 513.82s]  It's cold.
[513.82s -> 514.70s]  I'm stuck here.
[515.50s -> 516.70s]  Oh, this is you.
[516.70s -> 517.18s]  Oh, OK.
[517.74s -> 520.76s]  So you got to read it.
[520.76s -> 521.64s]  I am.
[521.64s -> 523.32s]  I'm trying to think of what I do for a voice for this person.
[523.32s -> 524.76s]  OK, like get in character.
[524.76s -> 525.48s]  Deep breath.
[525.48s -> 526.92s]  Have a feel for yourself.
[526.92s -> 528.28s]  Figure out what you want to sound like.
[529.08s -> 529.98s]  The audio.
[529.98s -> 530.86s]  How do I turn the audio down?
[534.34s -> 534.66s]  All right.
[534.66s -> 535.06s]  All right.
[535.06s -> 535.54s]  All right.
[535.54s -> 536.74s]  That's one thing he doesn't know.
[536.74s -> 537.14s]  Anything.
[539.05s -> 539.45s]  Anything.
[539.45s -> 540.33s]  Should it be like a...
[540.33s -> 540.97s]  OK.
[540.97s -> 541.69s]  Just make it you.
[541.69s -> 542.17s]  Just be you.
[542.17s -> 542.65s]  Just be you.
[542.65s -> 544.25s]  Anything to prove I lived, I guess.
[544.81s -> 545.69s]  Not that.
[545.69s -> 546.65s]  Not that I'm giving up.
[547.46s -> 548.42s]  Someone will come.
[548.42s -> 549.54s]  Maybe my friends.
[549.54s -> 556.06s]  It's still you.
[556.06s -> 557.26s]  Oh, I thought this was the narrator.
[557.98s -> 558.54s]  But all right.
[559.26s -> 565.37s]  This is how I'd started here in my yandering country.
[565.37s -> 567.85s]  Something in the woods is very strange.
[567.85s -> 572.76s]  I don't have any lines.
[574.94s -> 576.06s]  A line?
[576.06s -> 579.72s]  Concerned only with the depth and echo of his own thoughts,
[579.72s -> 583.96s]  a young man named Inan takes the seasonal road to the town of Thunderost.
[583.96s -> 585.48s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[586.12s -> 588.28s]  His whole character introduction is...
[588.28s -> 589.72s]  There's something going on in the woods.
[591.72s -> 592.22s]  Yeah.
[592.76s -> 593.26s]  OK.
[593.26s -> 594.36s]  There's a timeless problem.
[594.36s -> 595.48s]  The stone in the shoe.
[596.82s -> 598.50s]  When should one bend and remove it?
[598.50s -> 600.20s]  When is it finally time?
[600.28s -> 603.16s]  Where's that threshold between discomfort and laziness?
[603.16s -> 604.68s]  I could write a treatise, probably.
[606.22s -> 607.66s]  Breeze is light that day.
[607.66s -> 608.46s]  Birds are timid.
[609.50s -> 613.58s]  In fact, the whole world is taking a breath, ready to leap in the sea.
[613.58s -> 616.12s]  I'm there already, huh?
[616.12s -> 617.16s]  Here's the hard part.
[617.16s -> 618.68s]  Getting a longus out of bed.
[618.68s -> 623.69s]  Or worse, if I have to dislodge him from a book or smoke.
[625.22s -> 627.94s]  Fluttering flames roost among the far-off rooftops.
[627.94s -> 630.74s]  Inan hurries towards town, thinking of a longus,
[630.74s -> 636.62s]  a young man whom he's known since boyhood.
[636.62s -> 638.22s]  OK, so now I can choose...
[638.22s -> 639.82s]  Wait, you have to choose this?
[639.82s -> 640.32s]  Yeah.
[641.38s -> 645.06s]  I can choose to increase my rivalry, my friendship, or some romance.
[648.84s -> 650.12s]  Let's do friendship.
[650.12s -> 653.98s]  If we've known each other all our lives, I doubt we'd be rivals.
[653.98s -> 655.66s]  He must have tried to cook breakfast again.
[655.66s -> 656.38s]  There we go.
[656.38s -> 658.55s]  A longus!
[658.55s -> 659.43s]  You all right?
[659.43s -> 661.27s]  I'll get you out and just make a little noise.
[661.99s -> 663.76s]  OK.
[665.08s -> 666.74s]  Wait, what?
[666.74s -> 670.18s]  So it looks like my introduction is a burning village,
[670.18s -> 674.90s]  and I'm going to be in a solo combat situation looking for a longus.
[674.90s -> 676.26s]  So who is a longus?
[676.26s -> 676.98s]  Is that you, Ster?
[676.98s -> 677.46s]  That's me.
[678.10s -> 679.06s]  That's Ster.
[679.06s -> 682.66s]  So the game has decided that we are childhood friends, just randomly.
[682.66s -> 683.16s]  OK.
[684.71s -> 686.87s]  So now you can kind of get a feel for, like, the combat.
[686.87s -> 690.07s]  This is kind of the combat map, and it's all time-based,
[690.07s -> 696.62s]  and we all act at the same time, and then the enemies act at the same time.
[696.62s -> 698.06s]  Oh, so it should go pretty quick.
[698.06s -> 699.66s]  So this is a longus' house?
[701.62s -> 702.42s]  Yeah, look.
[702.42s -> 705.40s]  His house is still standing, at least.
[705.40s -> 706.44s]  A longus!
[706.62s -> 707.26s]  Fire right here.
[707.26s -> 708.22s]  You're not sleeping, are you?
[709.18s -> 715.26s]  What's going on here?
[715.82s -> 717.82s]  This is me, a longus.
[717.82s -> 718.70s]  He doesn't know.
[721.05s -> 723.77s]  Why is no one?
[723.77s -> 724.89s]  Hey, do you not smell the...
[725.45s -> 726.97s]  I smell the smoke.
[726.97s -> 727.69s]  Get inside.
[734.36s -> 736.12s]  Yeah, my bow.
[736.84s -> 738.84s]  The blaze is secondary.
[738.84s -> 740.60s]  It's doom's detail.
[740.60s -> 746.50s]  A herd of these hideous, afflicted-looking beasts.
[746.50s -> 747.00s]  Garoo!
[749.43s -> 751.03s]  They stampeded in.
[751.03s -> 753.75s]  I managed to trap one behind the house.
[753.75s -> 754.87s]  Small victory.
[754.87s -> 758.47s]  Staying in here is not really an option.
[759.77s -> 760.33s]  Right, so.
[761.05s -> 763.21s]  Here, I've got some tools around.
[763.21s -> 764.57s]  You're stronger than I am.
[764.57s -> 766.81s]  You can swing something pretty good.
[766.81s -> 768.65s]  I bet we can at least drive it off.
[768.65s -> 773.64s]  Okay, do I grab the pitchfork, the pickaxe, or the frying pan?
[773.64s -> 775.08s]  I'm going pickaxe here.
[775.08s -> 779.93s]  If it breaks stars, it'll break bones.
[779.93s -> 782.22s]  It can be killed, right?
[782.22s -> 784.94s]  If we're steady and methodical, we can manage it.
[786.07s -> 788.73s]  Steady and methodical beating of an animal.
[788.73s -> 790.17s]  Let's get it done.
[790.17s -> 794.49s]  I hope it just cuts to me and I've been eaten.
[797.26s -> 798.94s]  Our first enemy is a roe.
[798.94s -> 801.22s]  It looks like it's just a deer.
[801.22s -> 803.14s]  And we're going out the back of the house.
[803.14s -> 806.76s]  So that's the end of my turn.
[806.76s -> 807.80s]  I'm out of actions.
[807.80s -> 812.15s]  You should be in control of your character right now.
[812.15s -> 815.35s]  Okay, I will get behind you.
[815.35s -> 816.47s]  Okay.
[816.47s -> 817.35s]  With my bow.
[817.35s -> 822.15s]  I'm going to open the door and head out.
[822.15s -> 824.76s]  Enemy revealed.
[824.76s -> 825.80s]  Bow card.
[825.80s -> 829.11s]  That's my turn.
[829.11s -> 830.52s]  You have a shot?
[830.52s -> 831.16s]  Nope.
[831.16s -> 834.97s]  Your come out is going to be really interesting, because you're a wizard.
[834.97s -> 838.89s]  What you can do is you can like basically like you click on it.
[838.89s -> 839.85s]  Why did he go in the house?
[841.05s -> 842.33s]  Get out of my house.
[842.33s -> 842.81s]  Wait, what?
[843.61s -> 844.73s]  I'm going to strike it.
[844.73s -> 846.18s]  Oh, it's over there.
[849.56s -> 850.20s]  Where am I?
[850.76s -> 851.80s]  Holy shit.
[851.80s -> 853.00s]  You're so strong.
[853.00s -> 855.88s]  To get the AI has written out of our story already.
[855.88s -> 858.36s]  Okay, I leveled up so I can choose one of these three abilities.
[860.98s -> 861.62s]  That seems cool.
[863.99s -> 868.25s]  You're leveling up and you're in your room like, oh, I live near the forest.
[868.25s -> 869.53s]  Yeah, I looked out my window.
[869.53s -> 870.81s]  That's my whole story arc.
[870.81s -> 872.17s]  You leveled up as well?
[872.17s -> 873.13s]  With my level.
[877.37s -> 884.63s]  Everyone's saying you guys gave me the unplugged controller.
[884.63s -> 885.27s]  You're playing, dude.
[885.27s -> 886.55s]  Trust me, you're playing.
[886.55s -> 887.51s]  Oh, it's not my turn.
[887.51s -> 894.66s]  Okay.
[894.66s -> 896.18s]  Did you see that thing?
[896.18s -> 898.50s]  What could have wrought such a change?
[899.14s -> 901.06s]  Why did it go in my house?
[901.06s -> 902.50s]  The creature's death is quiet.
[902.50s -> 905.94s]  It seems to slip from life in a few stunned and hazy blinks.
[907.37s -> 909.93s]  Spend a piece of the day getting the flames under control.
[909.93s -> 911.61s]  The damage isn't as bad as it could have been.
[912.25s -> 915.61s]  Townsfolk emerge from hiding to fight fires and clear debris.
[915.61s -> 917.29s]  Some full of curiosity.
[917.29s -> 919.85s]  Others visibly haunted by what they've seen.
[919.85s -> 920.25s]  Geez.
[921.62s -> 922.58s]  We should go.
[922.58s -> 923.70s]  Thomas is alone.
[923.70s -> 927.22s]  Unless you think, I mean, I'm not sure who's safer suddenly.
[927.22s -> 928.90s]  Who the hell is Thomas?
[929.94s -> 932.34s]  It's like that kid that just sits in his window.
[932.34s -> 939.30s]  This is you, man.
[940.50s -> 942.38s]  I changed the line.
[942.38s -> 942.94s]  Oh, okay.
[942.94s -> 945.10s]  Oh, he did a little bit of improv.
[945.18s -> 946.14s]  Let's start one out.
[946.14s -> 947.66s]  Thomas will be waiting for us.
[947.66s -> 949.66s]  What happened today could be happening everywhere, couldn't it?
[951.64s -> 954.86s]  Something about that tower is just stuck in my mind.
[954.86s -> 962.84s]  It's like when you get an apple skin in your teeth.
[962.84s -> 963.80s]  Oh, some of these.
[964.89s -> 966.89s]  It unchecked the read-along with leader, I think.
[966.89s -> 967.69s]  Okay.
[967.69s -> 969.43s]  Are you caught up?
[969.43s -> 971.75s]  I know the sensation you describe.
[971.75s -> 972.55s]  Huh?
[972.55s -> 973.96s]  Yeah.
[973.96s -> 977.08s]  Anyway, I just think we said we'd meet him, so we should.
[977.08s -> 978.28s]  The towers and the hills.
[978.28s -> 978.92s]  You've been there?
[980.22s -> 981.86s]  Yeah, once.
[981.86s -> 984.42s]  Actually looking at the tracks, they come and they go.
[984.50s -> 986.78s]  That direction.
[986.78s -> 989.51s]  Oh, no.
[989.51s -> 993.59s]  And on and along us follow the pounded path of the monstrous feet,
[993.59s -> 997.27s]  hoping for the best and dreading every other possibility.
[997.27s -> 1001.90s]  Okay, this is your choice here.
[1001.90s -> 1003.42s]  How do you tell who's choosing?
[1005.13s -> 1014.09s]  Your character is front and center, so it's related to you.
[1014.09s -> 1018.18s]  If you have a rivalry with Thomas, a friendship, or maybe a romance.
[1018.18s -> 1018.82s]  A romance.
[1018.82s -> 1020.39s]  Okay.
[1020.39s -> 1025.94s]  A worthless while passes between them, but the quiet only heightens their worry.
[1025.94s -> 1027.78s]  You've always been a little fond of him, I thought.
[1027.78s -> 1028.34s]  Of Thomas.
[1031.48s -> 1032.78s]  What have I?
[1032.78s -> 1036.44s]  You've noticed.
[1036.44s -> 1037.16s]  Is that true?
[1037.72s -> 1040.46s]  I do find he's grown on me.
[1040.46s -> 1043.82s]  Always kind of looking for an angle, a way to get ahead.
[1043.82s -> 1044.94s]  He's not mean.
[1044.94s -> 1049.13s]  There's just kind of this unapologetic self-interest with him.
[1049.13s -> 1054.01s]  That makes me laugh.
[1054.01s -> 1063.54s]  And plus, it seems like no matter where he goes, we tend to have adventures.
[1063.54s -> 1064.10s]  All right.
[1064.10s -> 1064.90s]  Okay.
[1064.90s -> 1068.26s]  So now our next mission is to find Thomas at the tower.
[1069.51s -> 1073.59s]  It's kind of explained to us that the way we do this is we're going to scout the next area.
[1076.84s -> 1080.58s]  And then it takes some travel time.
[1080.58s -> 1082.50s]  And then sometimes we can be intercepted on the way,
[1082.50s -> 1084.18s]  but most of the time we'll just travel there.
[1084.18s -> 1088.78s]  And then we reveal and trigger the next kind of chapter.
[1088.78s -> 1089.50s]  He's not there.
[1089.50s -> 1092.41s]  He said he'd be here on time.
[1092.41s -> 1093.29s]  Previous night.
[1093.29s -> 1093.79s]  Eh?
[1094.41s -> 1097.21s]  The tower where Thomas had arranged to meet Inanna and along us
[1097.21s -> 1100.97s]  is a place he often used to escape to as a boy.
[1100.97s -> 1103.94s]  He knows its rooms and floors so well.
[1103.94s -> 1105.86s]  He could survive being chased through them.
[1112.50s -> 1113.78s]  And now I wait, I suppose.
[1117.27s -> 1122.15s]  The dust gets deep as rain puddles in here.
[1122.15s -> 1130.76s]  Alive is alive until that beast breaks through.
[1130.76s -> 1131.88s]  You're a rare beast.
[1138.84s -> 1140.20s]  Folks would pay to see you.
[1140.20s -> 1141.32s]  I'd pay not to.
[1141.32s -> 1145.77s]  The tower is an heirloom of an earlier people.
[1145.77s -> 1148.25s]  The locals have lost the legend of it.
[1148.25s -> 1150.49s]  The emptiness is deep and fragrant.
[1150.49s -> 1154.17s]  The odor of 10,000 rains soaked into the stone.
[1154.17s -> 1158.98s]  But as the old will tell you,
[1158.98s -> 1161.83s]  precious things go overlooked in a ruin.
[1161.83s -> 1164.07s]  But lodges amid the bones of failure
[1164.07s -> 1165.75s]  is often the dream that drove it.
[1165.75s -> 1169.53s]  What's this over here?
[1169.53s -> 1170.01s]  That book.
[1171.08s -> 1171.88s]  Why have I never?
[1174.81s -> 1175.69s]  Easy there.
[1175.69s -> 1179.46s]  I guess you're wondering why I'm talking to myself,
[1180.18s -> 1180.90s]  beast.
[1180.90s -> 1184.04s]  I'm also wondering too.
[1184.04s -> 1185.94s]  Thomas bends down.
[1189.67s -> 1191.46s]  Don't, it's me doing that.
[1191.46s -> 1193.78s]  The books, I was gasping as the audience.
[1193.78s -> 1197.00s]  The book's heavier than its slender spine suggests.
[1198.71s -> 1199.27s]  It's the game.
[1199.27s -> 1199.91s]  It's the game.
[1201.26s -> 1203.66s]  It's gone meta.
[1203.66s -> 1204.54s]  Look at this.
[1204.54s -> 1207.83s]  It's full of strange stories.
[1207.83s -> 1208.55s]  It's you.
[1208.55s -> 1209.59s]  No, no, no.
[1209.59s -> 1210.55s]  You can, you want to narrate this.
[1210.55s -> 1210.87s]  Go on.
[1210.87s -> 1211.11s]  Go ahead.
[1211.11s -> 1212.23s]  Oh, I thought I was reading it.
[1212.23s -> 1213.59s]  But no, I, yeah.
[1213.59s -> 1214.55s]  Anyone can narrate.
[1214.55s -> 1214.87s]  All right.
[1214.87s -> 1216.15s]  It's full of strange stories.
[1216.15s -> 1220.34s]  The folklore of folk long forgotten.
[1220.34s -> 1224.78s]  Candlelight leaping strikes no significant bell.
[1224.78s -> 1227.90s]  It's the weird story of a child watching candlelight
[1227.90s -> 1230.30s]  against the ceiling and wishing himself through it
[1230.94s -> 1234.04s]  to a far realm without grownups.
[1234.04s -> 1237.00s]  Wait, why, how old am I?
[1237.00s -> 1237.64s]  What?
[1237.64s -> 1239.34s]  Why am I reading this book?
[1239.34s -> 1240.22s]  Why do I have this?
[1241.54s -> 1243.30s]  Maybe you just, maybe you're an adult
[1243.30s -> 1244.90s]  and you just want to go where there's no other grownups.
[1246.89s -> 1252.79s]  Gift of the Inscriptor proposes an unlikely legend
[1252.79s -> 1257.35s]  that one spider-limbed woman crafted all written language.
[1257.35s -> 1260.87s]  She trapped ants between vellum and pressed them so long
[1260.87s -> 1265.45s]  and relentlessly that they became letters.
[1265.45s -> 1270.55s]  Mama Thunder Roast's horn spins the yarn of a mother
[1270.55s -> 1272.63s]  who drank so much and laughed so freely
[1272.63s -> 1274.79s]  that she grew a beautiful spiral horn.
[1274.79s -> 1276.44s]  Her children were very proud.
[1276.68s -> 1279.28s]  Huh?
[1279.90s -> 1285.11s]  I did that.
[1291.22s -> 1293.43s]  This book.
[1300.06s -> 1301.56s]  What's happening with this?
[1301.56s -> 1303.16s]  There's room in it for another story.
[1306.12s -> 1308.50s]  I'm stuck here.
[1308.50s -> 1313.53s]  But all right, this is how I'd start it.
[1313.53s -> 1315.85s]  Here in my yondering country.
[1316.17s -> 1319.85s]  Thomas writes, words are ready.
[1320.41s -> 1322.81s]  Omens have formed in the fabric of everything
[1322.81s -> 1324.97s]  and he's beginning to recognize them now.
[1324.97s -> 1325.47s]  Okay.
[1326.09s -> 1327.61s]  Some are just misgivings.
[1327.61s -> 1328.89s]  They've crept through his body
[1328.89s -> 1330.89s]  like the sourceless aches one wakes with.
[1331.85s -> 1333.13s]  Others are more substantial.
[1333.69s -> 1337.93s]  Now they seem lightning plain, a promise of thunder.
[1337.93s -> 1340.39s]  Somebody just called me a theater kid and it made me mad.
[1340.39s -> 1340.89s]  Hold on.
[1342.63s -> 1344.23s]  Time that person up for five minutes.
[1344.23s -> 1348.55s]  From the wild black woods where birds once belled,
[1348.55s -> 1350.81s]  a hateful silence churns.
[1353.75s -> 1355.11s]  Pain lights Thomas's head.
[1359.96s -> 1360.68s]  What?
[1360.68s -> 1361.40s]  Oh, I'm fired.
[1361.40s -> 1361.88s]  I made it.
[1364.55s -> 1366.31s]  He lowers his bleary eyes.
[1367.56s -> 1370.76s]  His story lies before him in luminous script.
[1370.76s -> 1373.24s]  Empty pages have sprouted behind it.
[1373.24s -> 1379.74s]  Why do I feel powerful?
[1379.74s -> 1382.81s]  Okay. What do you do?
[1382.81s -> 1386.17s]  I pull out a spoon.
[1386.17s -> 1387.21s]  Open wide, beast.
[1387.21s -> 1388.41s]  I'm getting out of here.
[1388.41s -> 1391.96s]  All right.
[1392.04s -> 1394.04s]  So this is a, you're fighting a rager.
[1394.04s -> 1396.28s]  This is going to be a solo combat for you.
[1396.28s -> 1396.78s]  Okay.
[1398.33s -> 1400.01s]  It charges without seeing.
[1400.01s -> 1402.09s]  And you've got actions.
[1402.09s -> 1406.04s]  I believe you can still cast spells as a wizard with a spoon.
[1406.04s -> 1407.16s]  Oh, that's right.
[1407.16s -> 1407.64s]  I'm a wizard.
[1407.64s -> 1408.14s]  Okay.
[1408.36s -> 1410.17s]  Where is this beast?
[1410.17s -> 1413.21s]  So you have to see him for him to appear.
[1413.21s -> 1413.77s]  I don't know.
[1413.77s -> 1415.83s]  Oh wait, attack scenery?
[1415.83s -> 1418.55s]  Yeah. So what you want to, so what you can do as a wizard
[1418.55s -> 1422.55s]  is you can basically imbue a piece of scenery with a spell
[1422.55s -> 1423.99s]  and then the following turn,
[1423.99s -> 1427.67s]  you can throw the thing you imbued at the beast.
[1427.67s -> 1430.55s]  So if you imbued a table or a fireplace,
[1430.55s -> 1433.69s]  you could throw a flame at the beast on the next turn.
[1433.69s -> 1434.25s]  Oh, okay.
[1434.25s -> 1435.05s]  So I could.
[1435.05s -> 1436.73s]  So you can see how there's like a link
[1436.73s -> 1438.81s]  that's attaching you to that scenery now.
[1438.81s -> 1439.29s]  Yep.
[1439.29s -> 1442.25s]  So you could probably spend your second action moving,
[1442.25s -> 1445.82s]  try and get, get eyes on this beast.
[1445.82s -> 1446.46s]  Yeah, there you go.
[1446.46s -> 1447.18s]  Here it is.
[1447.18s -> 1448.98s]  Okay. Now I'm gonna.
[1450.18s -> 1451.30s]  Yeah, grab it.
[1456.25s -> 1460.06s]  Okay. Wait, I'm throwing the fireplace?
[1460.06s -> 1462.30s]  You're going to be throwing the flames.
[1462.30s -> 1464.60s]  Oh, fireplace.
[1464.60s -> 1465.96s]  I can't reach.
[1465.96s -> 1466.84s]  All right. I'm just going to move.
[1466.84s -> 1468.36s]  I mean, this time you can just, you can move
[1468.36s -> 1470.44s]  or you can just end turn and you can let him approach.
[1470.44s -> 1472.15s]  Yeah. I'm going to get up here.
[1472.15s -> 1473.03s]  All right. There you are.
[1474.41s -> 1478.07s]  All right. Now let's, let's discuss that.
[1478.07s -> 1481.10s]  I'm wondering if.
[1481.10s -> 1481.98s]  Yeah, I have no idea.
[1481.98s -> 1485.66s]  Oh, okay. So it has to be within these tiles.
[1485.66s -> 1486.38s]  Yeah.
[1486.38s -> 1490.09s]  So I think I could just, how do I get over to the beast?
[1490.09s -> 1492.65s]  I think it's trying to get you to throw the bookcase at it
[1492.65s -> 1494.58s]  or something.
[1494.58s -> 1496.10s]  Can you, you can't target it.
[1496.10s -> 1497.14s]  Can you through the rubble?
[1497.14s -> 1498.34s]  I don't think so.
[1498.34s -> 1499.72s]  Maybe it's just end turn.
[1499.72s -> 1502.22s]  Well, yeah, maybe in turn and see how he approaches.
[1507.54s -> 1510.50s]  All right. He's trying to break through.
[1510.50s -> 1511.70s]  Yeah. Can you imbue the,
[1512.52s -> 1514.76s]  maybe you can imbue the rubble in front of you.
[1514.76s -> 1516.60s]  I think I just, can I burn this?
[1516.60s -> 1517.72s]  I just stole the fire.
[1518.28s -> 1518.84s]  Possibly.
[1518.84s -> 1521.05s]  Let me see if I can burn it.
[1521.05s -> 1524.95s]  Okay. Fire, steel fire.
[1524.95s -> 1527.83s]  Oh, maybe if you infuse something on his side,
[1527.83s -> 1528.95s]  like the bookshelf.
[1528.95s -> 1532.41s]  I can't target anything across this.
[1532.41s -> 1536.25s]  Should I start breaking shit?
[1536.25s -> 1537.53s]  Yeah. Just start breaking shit.
[1537.53s -> 1544.87s]  He's going out the door. I think.
[1544.87s -> 1545.51s]  All right. Hold on.
[1545.51s -> 1547.43s]  Break the rubble behind you maybe,
[1547.43s -> 1549.35s]  or infuse it and then throw it.
[1549.35s -> 1551.16s]  What does withdraw?
[1551.16s -> 1553.10s]  Stop. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[1553.74s -> 1556.98s]  I'm going to stop using this and let's, ah, here we go.
[1556.98s -> 1560.02s]  All right. I'm going to use the paper's table back here.
[1560.02s -> 1561.06s]  There it is.
[1561.06s -> 1561.94s]  Oh, good idea.
[1561.94s -> 1564.98s]  Then splinter blast him with it.
[1564.98s -> 1566.58s]  Yeah. Splinter blast. There you go.
[1566.58s -> 1568.79s]  All right. I get it. Let's go.
[1568.79s -> 1573.10s]  Oh, nice. Okay.
[1573.10s -> 1573.98s]  The same deal.
[1573.98s -> 1576.78s]  Down again. Same deal. Infuse something nearby.
[1578.92s -> 1581.80s]  Candles. And I'm going to,
[1581.80s -> 1586.52s]  oh, let's just light the room up.
[1586.52s -> 1588.44s]  Okay. I guess I'm done.
[1589.00s -> 1590.04s]  I guess I've lit the fire.
[1590.04s -> 1593.53s]  That's cozy.
[1593.53s -> 1597.18s]  Okay. Now if I can blow up,
[1597.18s -> 1598.22s]  I'm going to blow up the bookcase.
[1598.78s -> 1602.66s]  There we go. All right. See you later.
[1602.66s -> 1607.64s]  Look at that. Nice.
[1608.70s -> 1612.14s]  Okay. And Thomas, I think Thomas is going to level up.
[1612.14s -> 1612.62s]  There we go.
[1612.62s -> 1613.42s]  Ooh.
[1613.42s -> 1615.10s]  You can choose from these three abilities.
[1615.10s -> 1616.06s]  And so read through them,
[1616.06s -> 1617.98s]  see which one kind of you like the look of.
[1620.30s -> 1624.01s]  Elementalist, ignite or open mind.
[1624.01s -> 1626.57s]  Thomas can interfuse with one additional target.
[1626.57s -> 1629.83s]  That means you can link two targets at once.
[1629.83s -> 1631.19s]  Instead of just like the bookshelf,
[1631.19s -> 1632.71s]  you could do a bookshelf and a table.
[1634.82s -> 1635.30s]  I don't know.
[1636.97s -> 1638.97s]  Elementalist, what that kind of does
[1638.97s -> 1642.01s]  is it improves the things you interact with.
[1642.01s -> 1644.25s]  So if you interact with fire, it won't burn out.
[1644.25s -> 1645.13s]  If you interact with wood,
[1645.13s -> 1646.57s]  you get something called splinter salvo,
[1646.57s -> 1648.65s]  which is like a better version of what you just did.
[1649.61s -> 1650.73s]  I think, I think open mind.
[1650.73s -> 1652.25s]  I like having, I want to infuse with more stuff.
[1652.81s -> 1653.53s]  Cool. All right.
[1654.73s -> 1661.00s]  Ooh. And I got a, you got a amulet there,
[1661.00s -> 1662.04s]  a strap of golden links.
[1662.04s -> 1662.84s]  Everyone knows who's winning.
[1662.84s -> 1664.92s]  When you show up wearing this, it gives you bonus damage.
[1664.92s -> 1666.76s]  So you can just click your empty slot
[1666.76s -> 1667.88s]  and you can equip that.
[1667.88s -> 1669.00s]  Oh, nice. All right. Cool.
[1669.56s -> 1670.68s]  0.7 bonus damage.
[1671.40s -> 1672.44s]  This is pretty neat. I like this.
[1672.44s -> 1673.64s]  This is fun.
[1673.64s -> 1675.64s]  More monsters roam the battle halls
[1675.64s -> 1677.24s]  and rattle the rotting furniture.
[1678.92s -> 1682.60s]  But Thomas moves quietly, sensing his way in the dark.
[1682.60s -> 1684.36s]  Oh, you're already dressed like a wizard.
[1684.36s -> 1686.44s]  Daylight lands on his wrist.
[1686.44s -> 1688.68s]  Cool wind soothes his tired eyes.
[1689.96s -> 1692.33s]  I'm still allowed to live?
[1694.60s -> 1697.56s]  He closes the tower door gently to make no noise.
[1699.34s -> 1701.90s]  That was the mystic's art that I did.
[1701.90s -> 1702.70s]  Right, tower?
[1703.42s -> 1704.30s]  Where'd I get it from?
[1704.94s -> 1707.02s]  Could it have just happened?
[1707.58s -> 1710.41s]  Is it just one of those things?
[1711.21s -> 1713.94s]  Things a man's born with
[1713.94s -> 1716.50s]  that might blossom in his life when he needs them.
[1716.50s -> 1717.93s]  Well, I might not deserve it,
[1717.93s -> 1719.61s]  but you never turn down a turkey.
[1719.61s -> 1720.81s]  So they say.
[1720.81s -> 1721.53s]  I'm sorry.
[1721.53s -> 1724.42s]  That guy calling you a theater kid
[1724.42s -> 1727.26s]  is still Red Freak in my head.
[1727.26s -> 1728.22s]  Well, who never turns?
[1728.22s -> 1729.66s]  What if we never turn down a turkey?
[1731.53s -> 1732.01s]  You don't.
[1732.97s -> 1734.65s]  I bet this is you, Stan.
[1734.65s -> 1736.60s]  Thomas.
[1739.27s -> 1740.79s]  I should plumb the depths of this power,
[1740.79s -> 1742.63s]  but safely, I suppose, and out of sight.
[1742.63s -> 1744.15s]  I don't want anyone to know that I'm a magician.
[1744.79s -> 1745.29s]  Thomas.
[1745.83s -> 1746.95s]  You're okay.
[1746.95s -> 1747.59s]  You're okay.
[1748.23s -> 1749.43s]  You look like it.
[1750.07s -> 1753.30s]  Hey, Thomas, something happened.
[1754.18s -> 1757.14s]  And along us, you're here and you're safe.
[1757.14s -> 1757.64s]  Good.
[1758.18s -> 1758.90s]  Oh, sorry.
[1758.90s -> 1759.38s]  And you, too.
[1760.02s -> 1760.90s]  Is it how do I pronounce it?
[1761.46s -> 1761.94s]  Inon.
[1761.94s -> 1762.44s]  Inon.
[1765.58s -> 1768.38s]  Inon and I only barely made it.
[1768.38s -> 1771.69s]  Yeah, see that smoke on the horizon?
[1771.69s -> 1772.57s]  That's from the town.
[1773.59s -> 1775.43s]  Yeah, that's thunder roast.
[1776.30s -> 1776.86s]  It burned?
[1785.78s -> 1787.62s]  Things are different than they were.
[1791.22s -> 1791.72s]  Are they?
[1792.73s -> 1793.13s]  Yeah.
[1793.13s -> 1795.29s]  Well, I don't know if you've ever seen something quite like this.
[1797.40s -> 1798.12s]  A monster.
[1798.92s -> 1799.80s]  Sure, we have.
[1800.36s -> 1801.80s]  Yeah, we slay monsters.
[1802.82s -> 1803.38s]  Oh, good.
[1804.50s -> 1805.46s]  I'm glad you're okay.
[1805.46s -> 1806.90s]  Well, I do magic.
[1808.70s -> 1809.34s]  Yeah, I know.
[1809.90s -> 1811.42s]  We're childhood friends, apparently.
[1811.42s -> 1815.64s]  And our party has been formed.
[1815.64s -> 1817.24s]  So we've discovered a new site.
[1817.24s -> 1819.56s]  So you can see in the region of the Arnie Vigil,
[1819.56s -> 1821.32s]  you can see that sword banner.
[1821.32s -> 1825.40s]  And that means that there is a battle to be had.
[1825.96s -> 1826.84s]  Ooh, a battle.
[1827.56s -> 1829.00s]  Yeah, so let's do it.
[1832.94s -> 1833.90s]  I do magic.
[1834.46s -> 1836.94s]  Is there any information that might be pertinent?
[1845.61s -> 1847.21s]  Someone else narrate for a bit.
[1847.21s -> 1850.09s]  A perfect understanding isn't likely to emerge.
[1850.09s -> 1852.25s]  What these beasts are, where they came from,
[1852.25s -> 1854.89s]  and what drove them to attack the town of thunder roast.
[1854.89s -> 1859.27s]  But letting them nest here feels like the wrong idea.
[1859.27s -> 1862.39s]  By the way, sorry, I thought that said chatter in the lower left, not clatter.
[1862.39s -> 1866.25s]  So I was doing like, sorry, that's my bad.
[1866.25s -> 1869.37s]  Do we fan out, get aggressive, or maximize our defense?
[1869.37s -> 1870.94s]  Stay tight?
[1870.94s -> 1872.06s]  Sure, well.
[1872.06s -> 1880.95s]  Okay, so either Ster can choose Icarus as a suggestion,
[1880.95s -> 1884.02s]  or Jemma can choose Stoicism.
[1884.02s -> 1885.06s]  What? What?
[1885.06s -> 1887.38s]  Like, I mean, one is him and one is me.
[1887.38s -> 1889.54s]  This is one of the things where we just kind of decide as a group.
[1889.54s -> 1891.46s]  It's like, how do we want to approach this combat?
[1891.46s -> 1892.74s]  I guess we discuss.
[1893.77s -> 1895.77s]  Back in my house, it was pretty simple.
[1895.77s -> 1898.17s]  It ran in, and we hit it one time.
[1898.17s -> 1900.71s]  Or let them come to us.
[1900.71s -> 1902.49s]  I just came out of there.
[1902.49s -> 1908.84s]  If we're methodical, patient, we can fan them off at least.
[1908.84s -> 1913.08s]  No, he overpowered you.
[1913.08s -> 1914.44s]  I know what's best here.
[1914.44s -> 1917.40s]  Our modifier, we all get plus two damage.
[1917.40s -> 1918.42s]  Okay.
[1918.42s -> 1921.96s]  We have raccoons and roe as our foe cards.
[1923.61s -> 1926.49s]  All right, I guess I'm the tank, I think.
[1926.49s -> 1929.54s]  So I'll approach the door.
[1929.54s -> 1930.66s]  Okay, I'm going to.
[1931.30s -> 1934.34s]  Oh, we can move on our own move at the same time.
[1934.34s -> 1934.82s]  Yeah.
[1934.82s -> 1940.38s]  All right, I'll just stay in the back.
[1940.38s -> 1944.38s]  I'm going to I'm going to get a fuse ready here on the tree.
[1945.91s -> 1949.46s]  Just in case I'm going to imagine they're going to be lured out potentially.
[1949.46s -> 1951.37s]  Courage, Thomas.
[1951.37s -> 1952.33s]  Courage.
[1952.33s -> 1954.62s]  We must move forward.
[1954.62s -> 1958.22s]  But not me first.
[1958.22s -> 1959.58s]  And on.
[1959.58s -> 1962.30s]  I mean, I'm not I'm very squishy, so I'm not going to get in there.
[1962.30s -> 1968.95s]  Once you've used up your two action points, you want to just end time.
[1968.95s -> 1969.67s]  Oh, there it is.
[1971.59s -> 1972.71s]  You almost killed him in one hit.
[1973.45s -> 1975.45s]  I had sentinel, which is like an inception.
[1981.30s -> 1983.22s]  I will rush the raccoon.
[1984.26s -> 1984.82s]  Okay.
[1984.82s -> 1985.22s]  I guess.
[1985.86s -> 1986.66s]  I'm going to.
[1992.22s -> 1993.18s]  I'm coming in.
[1993.18s -> 1993.98s]  I'm just going to come in.
[1995.50s -> 1997.10s]  That's a good thing we got, Thomas.
[2008.47s -> 2009.19s]  All right.
[2009.19s -> 2009.99s]  That was good support.
[2011.03s -> 2012.23s]  Great work, everybody.
[2012.23s -> 2014.55s]  There's a little tutorial fight that we did.
[2014.55s -> 2015.19s]  Great, everyone.
[2017.48s -> 2019.64s]  Okay, we found Hunter's armor.
[2020.60s -> 2021.72s]  Armored two, warding one.
[2022.60s -> 2024.84s]  Town watchers who are good with a bow and who can't get anything fancy
[2024.84s -> 2027.16s]  have long traded to each other the secrets of Graybark.
[2028.12s -> 2029.72s]  This is an upgrade for along us.
[2030.84s -> 2031.16s]  Okay.
[2033.61s -> 2040.97s]  The misshapen creature folds its bones and dimes in a nice little neat pile.
[2041.61s -> 2043.29s]  Blue fluids darken the dust.
[2044.09s -> 2044.92s]  A sick.
[2044.92s -> 2046.20s]  Fascinating.
[2046.20s -> 2046.60s]  Grim.
[2047.24s -> 2048.52s]  The color in their veins.
[2048.52s -> 2049.32s]  What does it mean?
[2050.38s -> 2051.42s]  A sickness, probably.
[2052.14s -> 2056.33s]  Today is put reality in a spiral.
[2057.74s -> 2057.98s]  Yeah.
[2059.53s -> 2061.93s]  Day day drops, day rises.
[2061.93s -> 2062.97s]  Dusk is sweet.
[2062.97s -> 2064.65s]  The sunrise sweeter.
[2064.65s -> 2068.01s]  It's not long before they've cleaned the old tower up a bit.
[2068.97s -> 2072.87s]  There's still a thousand questions in this place.
[2072.87s -> 2073.43s]  Excites.
[2075.75s -> 2078.23s]  Even the oldest books say very little of what we've seen.
[2078.79s -> 2080.23s]  Monsters come from myths.
[2080.23s -> 2081.43s]  But where do myths come from?
[2082.07s -> 2083.43s]  I suppose we'll learn.
[2083.43s -> 2084.15s]  They're real now.
[2086.79s -> 2088.55s]  Let's not wait to be overrun.
[2088.55s -> 2090.39s]  We're a company of heroes now.
[2090.39s -> 2091.19s]  We'll walk the land.
[2091.19s -> 2092.15s]  We'll fight.
[2092.15s -> 2092.87s]  People need us.
[2093.43s -> 2095.83s]  We'll give ourselves a name and make sure it's one they'll sing.
[2096.95s -> 2098.23s]  Sounds like you've thought about this.
[2099.51s -> 2101.43s]  Name of the bands for cunts.
[2101.43s -> 2102.95s]  We name our company.
[2102.95s -> 2105.51s]  So my character suggestion is the Queer Crown.
[2105.51s -> 2106.71s]  Walkers of the Queer Crown.
[2108.26s -> 2110.58s]  Ster's suggestion is the Bats of the Fabulous Four.
[2110.58s -> 2113.30s]  And Jerma's suggestion is the Family of the Golden Romance.
[2114.58s -> 2114.98s]  Okay.
[2116.10s -> 2116.82s]  The family of the...
[2116.82s -> 2118.26s]  These are all our fault.
[2119.06s -> 2119.70s]  Yeah, yeah.
[2119.70s -> 2121.06s]  I don't think we're allowed to enter our own name.
[2121.06s -> 2122.98s]  I think we have to pick from our three.
[2123.46s -> 2126.90s]  Oh, the Bats of the Fabulous Four.
[2126.90s -> 2128.26s]  I think that's my favorite.
[2128.26s -> 2129.78s]  I like that because there's three of us.
[2129.78s -> 2131.78s]  Yeah, because there's not four people.
[2131.78s -> 2132.28s]  Let's do that.
[2134.17s -> 2136.81s]  After that, the three of them are inseparable.
[2136.81s -> 2137.93s]  Rumors are rampant.
[2137.93s -> 2139.05s]  Heroes are needed.
[2139.05s -> 2141.29s]  This world will be flooded in sorrows.
[2141.29s -> 2144.01s]  But its defenders are joined by a fire that night.
[2147.02s -> 2151.50s]  Here follow the tales of the Bats of the Fabulous Four.
[2151.50s -> 2152.46s]  Be remembered.
[2153.10s -> 2153.66s]  That's us.
[2154.30s -> 2155.26s]  Anime outro.
[2155.26s -> 2156.30s]  The game has crashed.
[2156.30s -> 2157.42s]  Please send your logs.
[2158.62s -> 2159.50s]  Oh, no.
[2159.50s -> 2160.06s]  What?
[2160.06s -> 2161.26s]  Yeah, my game crashed.
[2163.42s -> 2164.78s]  That's an interesting prompt.
[2166.60s -> 2166.84s]  Wait.
[2166.84s -> 2168.04s]  No, I'm still here.
[2168.04s -> 2168.82s]  Oh, you're here.
[2168.82s -> 2169.14s]  You're good.
[2169.14s -> 2169.38s]  Am I?
[2169.38s -> 2171.58s]  Hold on.
[2171.58s -> 2175.43s]  I think I'm seeing a card of a raccoon on the screen.
[2175.43s -> 2175.91s]  Oh, yep.
[2175.91s -> 2176.31s]  I can see it.
[2176.95s -> 2177.43s]  We're good.
[2177.43s -> 2177.75s]  Yeah, we're good.
[2177.75s -> 2178.23s]  We're good.
[2178.23s -> 2181.83s]  The way the combat system works is the longer our campaign goes,
[2182.79s -> 2186.31s]  we'll add more monster cards to the debt list of calamities.
[2186.31s -> 2187.91s]  And what that means is these monsters will...
[2187.91s -> 2188.79s]  There'll be new monsters.
[2188.79s -> 2189.59s]  They'll get tougher.
[2190.15s -> 2191.67s]  We'll encounter new things.
[2191.67s -> 2197.11s]  And so the longer we survive, the more the calamities of the world will grow.
[2197.11s -> 2197.51s]  Really?
[2197.51s -> 2197.75s]  Okay.
[2197.75s -> 2199.59s]  Right now, all we have is feral raccoons.
[2199.59s -> 2200.63s]  So we're the problem?
[2201.59s -> 2201.91s]  Yes.
[2203.27s -> 2205.03s]  So we have some choices here.
[2206.07s -> 2207.11s]  We have some land around us.
[2207.11s -> 2208.87s]  We have cloudy birch wilds.
[2208.87s -> 2209.99s]  We have gruff demon woods.
[2209.99s -> 2211.11s]  We have the demon wilds.
[2211.11s -> 2212.63s]  We have the humboldton beaches.
[2213.83s -> 2217.11s]  Two of these require us to build a bridge to reach.
[2217.11s -> 2220.79s]  The other two, we can just kind of walk there and kind of scout the area.
[2223.46s -> 2225.54s]  So where would you guys like to go?
[2225.54s -> 2226.58s]  What kind of sings to you?
[2227.30s -> 2227.54s]  Okay.
[2227.54s -> 2231.46s]  We got the humble demon, the demon wilds.
[2232.34s -> 2232.66s]  Yeah.
[2232.66s -> 2233.22s]  Rough demon.
[2233.22s -> 2233.86s]  Wild demons.
[2233.86s -> 2234.02s]  Yeah.
[2234.02s -> 2235.22s]  Wild demons going on.
[2235.96s -> 2238.76s]  The cloudy birch wild seems like the least demon-y place.
[2240.57s -> 2241.21s]  What do you guys think?
[2241.77s -> 2247.43s]  I think cloudy birch would be the safe play.
[2249.06s -> 2250.34s]  It sounds nice.
[2250.34s -> 2251.22s]  Yeah, it sounds nice.
[2251.22s -> 2252.66s]  What's wrong with my background?
[2253.62s -> 2254.50s]  What's wrong with my walls?
[2254.50s -> 2255.78s]  What do you mean?
[2255.78s -> 2257.82s]  It's like holding it.
[2257.82s -> 2258.86s]  You've been punching it again.
[2262.86s -> 2263.98s]  Yeah, you want a green screen?
[2263.98s -> 2264.46s]  No, no.
[2265.42s -> 2268.46s]  I think it's because you're seeing light come through the window.
[2269.98s -> 2272.06s]  Wait, did that say 23 days?
[2272.06s -> 2272.38s]  Yeah.
[2272.38s -> 2273.82s]  So the time is passing in real time.
[2273.82s -> 2276.38s]  You can see at the top, year one, spring, day 10, 11, 12, etc.
[2277.82s -> 2280.94s]  We killed a raccoon and we're like, we're adventurers now.
[2280.94s -> 2281.82s]  30 days.
[2281.82s -> 2282.62s]  Let's go.
[2282.62s -> 2285.50s]  So we've revealed the cloudy birch wilds and it looks like
[2285.50s -> 2288.22s]  there is a battle here to be had.
[2290.01s -> 2294.49s]  Okay, assault moose landing stone.
[2295.61s -> 2296.92s]  I have to be honest.
[2296.92s -> 2298.60s]  I'm glad it's you cooking tonight along us.
[2302.09s -> 2304.65s]  My feet are so tired that my hands are starting to feel it.
[2306.41s -> 2307.69s]  Don't get too excited.
[2310.55s -> 2311.43s]  It got excited.
[2314.87s -> 2318.71s]  So we'll hit moose landing stone tomorrow morning.
[2318.71s -> 2321.67s]  But that detour added more time than we thought it would
[2321.67s -> 2323.51s]  and our food is running a little low.
[2324.23s -> 2326.94s]  How low?
[2326.94s -> 2331.88s]  I've got onions and some more onions.
[2332.68s -> 2335.24s]  I still thought it was jerky.
[2336.38s -> 2339.50s]  I figured we'd need that tomorrow.
[2339.50s -> 2339.82s]  What?
[2343.05s -> 2344.81s]  Onions aren't a meal, they're an ingredient.
[2348.26s -> 2353.46s]  Okay, so we can either bet on me catching a fish 30% chance
[2354.10s -> 2358.42s]  or along us changing my mind and cooking an excellent onion
[2359.06s -> 2361.86s]  meal, which is a 51% chance to succeed.
[2362.98s -> 2364.34s]  Thomas, you settle this.
[2364.34s -> 2366.02s]  Should I cook or should he go fish?
[2366.02s -> 2367.38s]  Yeah, I think that's a good way to do it.
[2367.38s -> 2368.82s]  The person not involved gets a pick.
[2370.98s -> 2375.56s]  I think that what we should really do is I'd like to see if you can change his mind.
[2375.56s -> 2378.76s]  I feel like onions could actually be a meal if you put them into an onion soup
[2378.76s -> 2381.48s]  and make a broth and make it salty and put a little bit of cheese on it.
[2381.48s -> 2383.30s]  Let's do it.
[2383.30s -> 2388.54s]  A good onion soup can hold its own against any other meal.
[2388.54s -> 2389.58s]  Low and slow.
[2390.38s -> 2391.74s]  That's the key.
[2391.74s -> 2393.83s]  How slow?
[2393.83s -> 2396.47s]  Start thinking of stories now.
[2399.74s -> 2404.79s]  The version they tell in Cloudy Birch's Wilds differs in one key way, you see,
[2404.79s -> 2410.07s]  because of the agricultural significance of the later.
[2410.07s -> 2413.99s]  And as I was astounded, there it was in the original document.
[2413.99s -> 2414.55s]  Document?
[2415.29s -> 2416.73s]  Even later than that.
[2416.73s -> 2419.19s]  So how much longer do you think?
[2421.46s -> 2426.20s]  They're not doing what I wanted them to do.
[2426.20s -> 2430.82s]  I'm not sure if it's salvageable at this point.
[2430.82s -> 2433.06s]  Sorry about the onion mush.
[2433.06s -> 2434.20s]  What did you even do?
[2435.00s -> 2437.00s]  No, it's good.
[2437.00s -> 2438.81s]  It's OK.
[2438.81s -> 2439.29s]  You're right.
[2439.29s -> 2440.17s]  It's disgusting.
[2440.17s -> 2441.45s]  But thanks for trying.
[2441.45s -> 2447.10s]  You shall soon come to learn the tragic extent of my failings.
[2447.10s -> 2447.42s]  All right.
[2447.42s -> 2452.84s]  We had a terrible onion soup and then we got attacked by enemies.
[2452.84s -> 2458.04s]  Oh, shit.
[2458.04s -> 2458.76s]  All right.
[2458.76s -> 2460.84s]  They're in here.
[2460.84s -> 2462.04s]  Yeah, most likely.
[2462.04s -> 2466.20s]  I remember when we did this a month ago.
[2466.20s -> 2468.25s]  Different times.
[2468.25s -> 2471.22s]  I'm pretty sure same tower.
[2471.22s -> 2472.62s]  Quite not.
[2472.62s -> 2473.18s]  Where are they?
[2473.18s -> 2474.54s]  There's three monsters in here.
[2474.54s -> 2477.19s]  They're going to be in the back rooms, probably.
[2480.25s -> 2482.84s]  Looks like Thomas go off on his own.
[2482.84s -> 2486.26s]  I'm opening this door.
[2486.26s -> 2486.82s]  Nothing in here.
[2489.91s -> 2490.63s]  Oh, God.
[2490.63s -> 2491.43s]  What?
[2491.43s -> 2492.31s]  Oh, shit.
[2492.31s -> 2493.83s]  I just started blasting.
[2493.83s -> 2494.15s]  Hold on.
[2494.15s -> 2494.55s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2494.55s -> 2495.03s]  Oh, I'm coming.
[2495.03s -> 2495.67s]  I'm coming.
[2495.67s -> 2497.61s]  Can I blast through the wall?
[2497.61s -> 2501.42s]  Probably.
[2506.84s -> 2507.40s]  Oh, God.
[2508.81s -> 2509.53s]  Oh, shit.
[2510.25s -> 2511.77s]  Oh, oh, it hurts.
[2511.77s -> 2512.41s]  Oh, watch out.
[2512.41s -> 2512.81s]  Watch out.
[2512.81s -> 2513.77s]  I'm going to throw a fireball.
[2515.18s -> 2517.66s]  One eye goes dark like a candle prematurely snuffed.
[2517.66s -> 2519.58s]  And then fights the sensation that he's swimming.
[2519.58s -> 2520.94s]  Fights to stay on his feet.
[2523.10s -> 2525.02s]  So I can choose to just die.
[2526.46s -> 2528.54s]  Dealing 12 damage to the enemies.
[2528.54s -> 2530.94s]  Or I can choose to fight on.
[2530.94s -> 2534.22s]  But I will get minus 15 accuracy for the rest of the campaign.
[2535.35s -> 2535.91s]  That's rough.
[2535.91s -> 2537.59s]  Two of us get through life unscathed.
[2537.59s -> 2538.79s]  Now's no time to give up.
[2540.38s -> 2541.42s]  I've lost an eye.
[2541.42s -> 2543.02s]  And then feels his way back to safety.
[2543.02s -> 2544.62s]  There's so much that he has to live for.
[2544.62s -> 2545.58s]  So much ahead of him.
[2545.58s -> 2547.10s]  If he can make it through today.
[2547.10s -> 2549.74s]  An eye patch might add a dash of mystique to my look.
[2549.74s -> 2551.10s]  I literally lost an eye.
[2551.10s -> 2553.74s]  Can you imagine saying that while getting attacked?
[2553.74s -> 2554.70s]  Your eye pops out.
[2554.70s -> 2556.54s]  Oh, an eye patch might add mystique.
[2556.54s -> 2559.82s]  And your stomach hurts from gross onion mush.
[2559.82s -> 2561.98s]  You guys are going to have to deal with this.
[2561.98s -> 2562.78s]  Now I'm gone.
[2562.78s -> 2563.02s]  All right.
[2563.02s -> 2567.02s]  I think let me tell you something along us.
[2567.02s -> 2568.78s]  I'm going to torch this room.
[2568.78s -> 2570.46s]  I just want to make sure you understand.
[2570.46s -> 2572.70s]  My eyes just went flame, right?
[2572.70s -> 2573.50s]  And everyone's like, oh, my God.
[2573.50s -> 2575.02s]  He's going to use his powers finally.
[2575.02s -> 2576.70s]  It's been like 45 minutes into the movie.
[2576.70s -> 2577.90s]  And everyone knows I'm going to hear it comes.
[2577.90s -> 2581.54s]  Here comes the powers.
[2581.54s -> 2584.18s]  OK, so he's going to infuse that clothing rack
[2584.18s -> 2585.94s]  and throw a t-shirt at the deer.
[2588.70s -> 2591.94s]  So wait, do we do I have to hit done?
[2593.06s -> 2594.74s]  No, this is a fresh turn.
[2594.74s -> 2595.54s]  You've got two actions.
[2596.66s -> 2597.30s]  Why are you dead?
[2598.49s -> 2601.61s]  He fucking says I came out three enemies and my eye came out.
[2602.17s -> 2603.45s]  But you're on the screen anymore.
[2603.45s -> 2605.05s]  I don't think you want to move up on that.
[2605.05s -> 2607.45s]  Yeah, Thomas, Thomas, do not run up there.
[2607.45s -> 2609.45s]  I'm not going to but you have no armor.
[2610.01s -> 2610.33s]  All right.
[2610.33s -> 2612.41s]  You see the you see the mannequins up here on the right?
[2613.13s -> 2614.41s]  Yeah, those have been infused.
[2614.41s -> 2615.85s]  What we're going to do is we're going to pull them back
[2615.85s -> 2619.29s]  and then I'm going to back and you're talking character, boy.
[2621.05s -> 2622.89s]  OK, flame eyes.
[2625.16s -> 2626.92s]  Stand back along us.
[2626.92s -> 2627.96s]  I'll handle this.
[2627.96s -> 2629.96s]  You step back, pull them through.
[2631.29s -> 2636.09s]  I'm pulling, I'm pulling and your turn when you're ready, though.
[2636.89s -> 2642.42s]  OK, push through aggressively.
[2643.30s -> 2643.80s]  Step back.
[2643.80s -> 2651.69s]  No, OK, flair.
[2655.24s -> 2656.12s]  They're blinded.
[2657.64s -> 2661.40s]  Uh, they will miss their next attack.
[2661.40s -> 2665.68s]  You might want to line of sight the raccoon, though, like get away.
[2666.86s -> 2667.98s]  You might be right.
[2672.99s -> 2674.11s]  So you are you're ranged.
[2674.11s -> 2674.61s]  Oh, sorry.
[2675.63s -> 2676.51s]  Can you use that bow?
[2678.54s -> 2680.70s]  My special ability, thunder shot.
[2684.41s -> 2684.91s]  Got him.
[2691.53s -> 2694.49s]  That's a good thing that that all that books and clothes was there.
[2695.64s -> 2696.14s]  OK.
[2696.84s -> 2697.80s]  What do I want to do here?
[2700.97s -> 2703.21s]  Constriction power.
[2703.21s -> 2705.69s]  You blocked it.
[2707.02s -> 2708.14s]  Can you still move, pal?
[2708.14s -> 2712.60s]  Maybe you get outside slow and methodical, like you used to say.
[2715.05s -> 2715.69s]  I can't move.
[2715.69s -> 2716.17s]  I just tried.
[2716.17s -> 2716.89s]  I did my I did.
[2716.89s -> 2717.85s]  I used my power.
[2722.40s -> 2723.12s]  Nice shot.
[2728.00s -> 2729.53s]  I've got plenty of cover here.
[2730.67s -> 2731.47s]  I'm still infused.
[2732.27s -> 2736.41s]  Oh, should we go hide in this room?
[2736.41s -> 2737.45s]  We should probably hide in the other room.
[2737.45s -> 2738.17s]  Oh, you're going in.
[2738.17s -> 2739.29s]  OK, I'm going to come in with you.
[2739.93s -> 2742.09s]  My secret ability, silk step.
[2745.32s -> 2747.32s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2747.32s -> 2747.48s]  What?
[2747.48s -> 2748.12s]  How does this work?
[2748.84s -> 2749.24s]  Hold on.
[2749.24s -> 2750.36s]  I'm reading my special duty.
[2752.20s -> 2753.08s]  Oh, check this out.
[2757.69s -> 2766.40s]  Can you kill it?
[2766.40s -> 2766.96s]  Good block.
[2767.84s -> 2771.13s]  I can't believe he's blocked twice and I'm the tank and I just lost an eye.
[2773.18s -> 2773.82s]  I'm confused.
[2773.82s -> 2777.15s]  So except supposed to make me hidden.
[2777.15s -> 2778.75s]  But then it also told me to move.
[2780.65s -> 2783.37s]  I don't know how the ability is worth.
[2783.37s -> 2784.41s]  Great job, Thomas.
[2784.41s -> 2785.13s]  Let's find that.
[2785.13s -> 2786.57s]  I let you have an eye patch.
[2786.57s -> 2787.07s]  Look.
[2787.85s -> 2788.81s]  Oh, you do have an eye patch.
[2788.81s -> 2789.31s]  That's funny.
[2790.62s -> 2793.34s]  OK, we got the lizard beam spear.
[2797.47s -> 2800.11s]  I think I will replace my pickaxe with that.
[2800.11s -> 2806.86s]  Sure, you can handle a spear with one eye.
[2806.86s -> 2808.22s]  It's kind of a precise weapon.
[2809.12s -> 2810.48s]  Oh, I get to name the item.
[2815.92s -> 2817.12s]  So that's five damage, right?
[2819.15s -> 2820.11s]  That definitely should go to you.
[2820.91s -> 2821.95s]  And then we have a ring.
[2822.67s -> 2825.39s]  Warding, which is plus eight zero point warding.
[2826.11s -> 2827.63s]  That's magic magic armor.
[2828.27s -> 2832.22s]  The way gear works is if you hover over the empty slot for everyone,
[2832.22s -> 2835.82s]  it will tell you the warding will go up from two point one to two point nine.
[2835.82s -> 2839.18s]  So every value of one is like an upgrade.
[2839.18s -> 2841.90s]  It says it absorbs magic damage in on.
[2841.90s -> 2842.94s]  You should take it.
[2842.94s -> 2843.50s]  You're mine.
[2843.50s -> 2844.14s]  You're tanking.
[2844.78s -> 2846.54s]  Yeah, I'll grab it.
[2847.90s -> 2852.16s]  Yeah, my way through hell, my friend.
[2854.76s -> 2859.00s]  And the thought of you trekking back in this state is unacceptable.
[2859.00s -> 2861.48s]  I'm going to make you some onion soup.
[2864.76s -> 2865.08s]  Blue.
[2865.64s -> 2865.88s]  Good.
[2865.88s -> 2866.68s]  You're still here.
[2867.40s -> 2868.33s]  All right.
[2868.33s -> 2869.29s]  Who wants to play Luke?
[2869.29s -> 2869.93s]  This is a new cat.
[2869.93s -> 2871.05s]  Wait, is this a new character?
[2871.05s -> 2873.53s]  I just introducing us to an MPC.
[2873.53s -> 2873.77s]  OK.
[2873.77s -> 2874.17s]  Hello.
[2877.47s -> 2879.55s]  And on this is Luke.
[2879.55s -> 2881.31s]  She's headed back out of here.
[2881.31s -> 2885.47s]  And I've arranged a slight detour for her to give you a lift back to town.
[2885.47s -> 2886.59s]  It's just an eye, mate.
[2887.39s -> 2888.03s]  Arranged.
[2888.83s -> 2891.55s]  You mean you bombardo is some arsenal of reasons.
[2892.27s -> 2894.91s]  They were extremely solid reasons.
[2896.48s -> 2896.72s]  Huh.
[2897.79s -> 2898.11s]  What?
[2899.61s -> 2901.45s]  Just feels weird getting special treatment.
[2902.88s -> 2906.32s]  Then think of it as balancing the scales a bit.
[2909.18s -> 2912.46s]  You were in front of death's door not that long ago.
[2913.18s -> 2915.98s]  It's time to enjoy the good fortune where you can find it.
[2918.06s -> 2920.38s]  Take care as long as you need.
[2920.38s -> 2921.82s]  I mean, you're sending me away.
[2921.82s -> 2922.70s]  I've been sent away.
[2923.58s -> 2926.22s]  So in our first fight, I died, lost an eye,
[2926.22s -> 2928.46s]  and now you're sending me away to like a home.
[2930.06s -> 2931.34s]  What is happening to you?
[2931.34s -> 2935.98s]  You're just getting a nice tree tops passing by the bump in that ox smell.
[2936.62s -> 2937.18s]  What?
[2937.18s -> 2937.58s]  What?
[2937.58s -> 2938.06s]  What?
[2938.06s -> 2939.74s]  Enemies improve their strategy.
[2939.74s -> 2939.98s]  OK.
[2939.98s -> 2945.58s]  So they've added the deer are now corrupted and they leave trails of corruption when they move.
[2945.58s -> 2946.06s]  Oh, no.
[2947.64s -> 2948.36s]  OK.
[2948.36s -> 2951.47s]  So I am.
[2951.47s -> 2953.07s]  You're legit gone.
[2953.07s -> 2956.67s]  Yeah, I am maimed and it will take me some time to heal.
[2956.67s -> 2958.83s]  So you guys are going to have to travel ahead of me.
[2958.83s -> 2959.47s]  Oh, no.
[2959.55s -> 2960.19s]  Next place.
[2960.75s -> 2963.63s]  Wait, we're turning back to thunder roast on a wagon.
[2963.63s -> 2965.07s]  Why are we going the other way?
[2965.07s -> 2966.11s]  Why are you back with you?
[2966.11s -> 2967.31s]  Why did we send you back?
[2967.87s -> 2968.91s]  Because I mean, I'm wounded.
[2968.91s -> 2969.79s]  I lost an eye, guys.
[2969.79s -> 2971.39s]  Well, we could go back with you.
[2971.39s -> 2973.07s]  No, it's you chose not to.
[2973.07s -> 2973.95s]  That's OK.
[2973.95s -> 2978.38s]  Painted by the amber by painted amber by the fading light,
[2978.38s -> 2980.86s]  a formation of stone catches a long as his eye.
[2981.90s -> 2983.88s]  You think something's up there?
[2984.44s -> 2994.89s]  You never know what you'll find until you look upon the hill summit.
[2996.44s -> 2996.84s]  Nothing.
[3000.20s -> 3001.64s]  Turns out your eyesight is shit.
[3002.57s -> 3003.69s]  The decent view, at least.
[3004.25s -> 3007.34s]  Look, you can see the salt road.
[3007.34s -> 3008.70s]  Oh, far in the distance.
[3008.70s -> 3010.78s]  I think that's our friend going back to town.
[3011.42s -> 3013.08s]  What's happening?
[3013.08s -> 3013.80s]  A thrumming.
[3013.80s -> 3014.28s]  What's that?
[3014.84s -> 3016.92s]  It grows louder, a rumbling.
[3016.92s -> 3023.44s]  Well, and louder until the stone underfoot shatters and shakes.
[3025.44s -> 3027.12s]  It grows louder, even more.
[3027.12s -> 3027.68s]  Very loud.
[3028.32s -> 3029.44s]  Oh, it's so loud.
[3031.87s -> 3032.35s]  OK.
[3032.35s -> 3034.83s]  The mighty growl, calamorous, was thundering.
[3035.47s -> 3037.13s]  And that resolves.
[3037.13s -> 3037.63s]  OK.
[3038.25s -> 3038.75s]  OK.
[3039.77s -> 3041.13s]  That was weird.
[3041.13s -> 3042.49s]  That was close.
[3042.49s -> 3043.29s]  Oh, hold me.
[3043.85s -> 3047.05s]  Maybe we shouldn't have took all those drugs 20 minutes ago.
[3048.57s -> 3049.45s]  Probably a bad idea.
[3049.45s -> 3050.01s]  Corruption.
[3051.72s -> 3052.28s]  A voice.
[3053.95s -> 3054.59s]  I.
[3054.59s -> 3061.26s]  The voice of a carnivore cunning and crooning,
[3061.26s -> 3064.22s]  warning them to run, promising to give chase.
[3065.18s -> 3068.99s]  The one you have hunted so long.
[3070.27s -> 3072.83s]  In my dreams at night, I would think of this animal.
[3073.79s -> 3077.26s]  Through cups and riddles.
[3077.26s -> 3078.30s]  That doesn't sound right.
[3080.08s -> 3087.60s]  You have hunted so long for me and for a brotherhood that should be yours.
[3090.24s -> 3091.12s]  Wait, can I go back?
[3094.40s -> 3096.00s]  Do you see your face, Thomas?
[3096.16s -> 3096.66s]  Yeah.
[3098.32s -> 3100.00s]  I like know what's going on.
[3100.88s -> 3102.08s]  You're tripping.
[3102.08s -> 3106.49s]  I'm like, do you know my name?
[3107.80s -> 3108.44s]  Her name.
[3110.03s -> 3113.39s]  It was the gift I gave to your ancestors.
[3113.39s -> 3114.27s]  Thomas is still tripping.
[3115.79s -> 3122.67s]  They walked my myth over Greenfield and Fallow to the curves and corners of being they walked.
[3124.70s -> 3127.18s]  Do you know my name?
[3127.66s -> 3129.50s]  Uh, how would I?
[3130.38s -> 3137.66s]  A blessing heard through ancient service, an oath written in the steps and trails
[3138.30s -> 3139.90s]  and sealed with a name.
[3140.62s -> 3142.86s]  You need only to know it.
[3144.94s -> 3148.38s]  I'll ask you once more.
[3148.38s -> 3149.66s]  We don't know your name.
[3149.66s -> 3151.42s]  We don't know your name.
[3151.42s -> 3153.66s]  Do you know my name?
[3155.08s -> 3156.68s]  Lot I, yes.
[3158.19s -> 3159.95s]  I hope that's right.
[3163.40s -> 3167.88s]  It's like reading a fairy tale from your childhood only to realize how disturbing it is.
[3167.88s -> 3171.88s]  The Longest doesn't like knowing the name, but he's sure it's right.
[3172.84s -> 3173.32s]  Sorry.
[3174.28s -> 3180.52s]  Yes, I am lock chaos, your wolf God.
[3181.16s -> 3191.48s]  And now you may take my oath, abandon your humanity, my boy, and be blessed as wolf kind.
[3191.48s -> 3192.28s]  Oh, yes.
[3193.64s -> 3196.12s]  I always knew that I was different somehow.
[3196.84s -> 3197.96s]  A furry perhaps.
[3199.34s -> 3204.22s]  It feels like coming home, taking oath along us.
[3204.22s -> 3210.30s]  No, I'm going home along us, kneels and beneath him a green light pools.
[3210.30s -> 3213.90s]  Dandelions rise yellow out of the sparse wind scraped dirt.
[3213.90s -> 3217.74s]  They grow old and white, throw their seeds and then wilt to nothing.
[3217.74s -> 3221.85s]  The God rock he kneels upon hums.
[3221.85s -> 3223.77s]  It cracks somewhere inside.
[3223.77s -> 3232.41s]  A geode of understanding splits and catches light beneath the earth and behind his eyes.
[3232.41s -> 3233.13s]  Mildly.
[3233.13s -> 3239.21s]  Somebody like took a picture of you to flash on in like a bar late at night.
[3239.21s -> 3245.36s]  We're going to get the anamorphs transition along us.
[3258.44s -> 3260.20s]  Plus forward time and age.
[3260.20s -> 3261.48s]  You have human arms.
[3262.20s -> 3263.72s]  You just have a wolf.
[3263.72s -> 3265.16s]  You have a wolf head.
[3265.16s -> 3266.04s]  That's it, man.
[3266.04s -> 3268.52s]  When when I next see you, I'm going to be very confused.
[3269.66s -> 3270.38s]  Oh, no.
[3270.94s -> 3271.85s]  Okay.
[3271.85s -> 3279.00s]  So what we can do is you can head back to moose landing and you can secure it.
[3279.00s -> 3281.40s]  And that will give us like a source of income.
[3282.20s -> 3284.92s]  Are we able to station here earn resources?
[3285.56s -> 3286.12s]  Yeah.
[3286.12s -> 3288.12s]  So we can you want to build a station in Pinewood?
[3289.20s -> 3290.16s]  That's a good.
[3290.16s -> 3291.84s]  I'm running around chasing squirrels.
[3291.84s -> 3293.28s]  What does Thomas do?
[3293.28s -> 3294.08s]  Okay.
[3294.08s -> 3294.58s]  Okay.
[3296.33s -> 3299.45s]  Oh, no, I this is going to and you chose this fate.
[3299.45s -> 3300.65s]  So you have to stick with it.
[3300.65s -> 3304.46s]  Wait, do I have a laboring?
[3304.46s -> 3305.26s]  God damn it.
[3307.69s -> 3309.05s]  You have to you have to go all out.
[3309.05s -> 3312.49s]  But you know, you could do the wolf from every major RPG.
[3312.49s -> 3315.23s]  And that's just like this talk.
[3315.23s -> 3319.47s]  Just like this with a little bit of a little, you know, you don't really care that much.
[3319.47s -> 3322.51s]  Labor intensive, but practical in the long run.
[3322.51s -> 3324.67s]  I don't know how I got this accent.
[3324.67s -> 3327.40s]  Should we lend a hand?
[3327.40s -> 3328.36s]  I'm going Batman.
[3329.82s -> 3334.54s]  Cowlings of sleeping top have been dreaming of building a new threshery or lumber yard.
[3334.54s -> 3336.86s]  The wild folk want to restore the woodland altar.
[3337.98s -> 3342.22s]  Okay, so we can spend one of our legacy points, which we get, we got a bunch for each campaign.
[3342.22s -> 3346.30s]  We can have a build a threshery, which will provide us with wooden fabric or a lumber wood.
[3346.30s -> 3350.46s]  The lumber yard will provide us to wood and a primal altar will give us hides and spell threads.
[3350.46s -> 3354.22s]  And all this stuff can be used at the end of each chapter to craft new gear for us.
[3354.22s -> 3354.72s]  Hmm.
[3355.50s -> 3358.54s]  I mean, I'm going to vote for the, uh, for the spell threads because I mean,
[3358.54s -> 3363.74s]  if you saw on the land, the previous battle, my, uh, my flames were very, very effective.
[3363.74s -> 3365.58s]  Three damage each at least.
[3365.58s -> 3368.67s]  Okay. Well, it's going to take 25 days to complete.
[3368.67s -> 3369.23s]  Get to work.
[3369.95s -> 3370.83s]  25 days?
[3371.47s -> 3372.83s]  I'm healing all the while.
[3372.83s -> 3373.79s]  Oh, okay. Good.
[3373.79s -> 3375.15s]  Inan has returned.
[3375.15s -> 3379.87s]  Okay. So while you guys are doing that, I will go to moon's landing and meet you there.
[3379.87s -> 3380.91s]  Moose landing.
[3380.91s -> 3381.41s]  Okay.
[3382.13s -> 3386.29s]  There are studies must be comprehensive and meticulous.
[3386.93s -> 3387.81s]  I'm up to it.
[3389.17s -> 3390.29s]  If no one else is.
[3391.33s -> 3393.25s]  I'm so glad I'm not the wolf character and you are.
[3393.25s -> 3397.41s]  We can invest, we can investigate thoroughly to find a new item.
[3397.41s -> 3400.61s]  We can prioritize speed for like crafting stuff.
[3400.61s -> 3402.72s]  I think we find an item here.
[3402.72s -> 3403.84s]  Yeah, I agree.
[3404.80s -> 3405.84s]  Okay. Let's do an item.
[3406.72s -> 3407.84s]  So this is my job.
[3408.72s -> 3412.80s]  I will head there and find an item while you guys build that place.
[3412.80s -> 3413.30s]  Cool.
[3414.00s -> 3418.38s]  Uh, alter dedicated longhorn alter now produces hides and spell threads.
[3418.38s -> 3420.06s]  So you guys can probably come and meet me if you want.
[3420.94s -> 3424.14s]  Yeah. Do we have to do anything else with, with this or is this just stays here?
[3424.14s -> 3425.10s]  No, it's, it's all done.
[3425.10s -> 3427.50s]  Yeah. That'll, that'll be, that's good.
[3431.50s -> 3432.38s]  All right, let's head over there.
[3433.34s -> 3437.15s]  Okay. So now we just want to stay here and see this through.
[3437.95s -> 3439.31s]  I think we see this through.
[3443.86s -> 3447.34s]  If it's going to be adjacent to our altar over there, right?
[3447.34s -> 3448.94s]  Yeah. I think we should make sure it's secured.
[3450.59s -> 3451.63s]  Someone paused.
[3451.63s -> 3457.76s]  Uh, infants infestations increase the strength of the source threat.
[3457.76s -> 3460.00s]  Can ambush groups of two or one heroes.
[3460.00s -> 3461.20s]  It's dangerous out there.
[3461.76s -> 3464.64s]  Don't travel alone or split the party at every opportunity.
[3466.22s -> 3468.32s]  Hmm. Okay.
[3468.32s -> 3470.00s]  We're going to take the source out.
[3470.00s -> 3474.16s]  All right.
[3475.68s -> 3480.08s]  A thorough delving through the mysterious mysteries of the moose laying stone has
[3480.08s -> 3481.20s]  proven rewarding.
[3481.20s -> 3484.16s]  Which strikes me how much this is defined to know.
[3484.16s -> 3486.72s]  I can't believe I haven't reacted to your wolf head.
[3486.72s -> 3486.88s]  Yeah.
[3486.88s -> 3489.36s]  Moose landing stone will return to the hands of the common folk.
[3489.36s -> 3493.20s]  And while they tend it, this site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.
[3493.20s -> 3494.56s]  When will he notice me?
[3495.20s -> 3498.00s]  Do we want, uh, hides ingots or spell threads?
[3498.00s -> 3500.80s]  I say ingots like a bit of steel.
[3501.68s -> 3503.60s]  I think it's useful for everybody.
[3503.60s -> 3504.48s]  I think that's a good idea.
[3504.48s -> 3507.28s]  Okay. Oh, we get, we actually just get all three.
[3507.28s -> 3508.56s]  Oh, we get it all. Cool.
[3508.56s -> 3508.96s]  All right.
[3509.76s -> 3512.00s]  Who's still reading?
[3512.00s -> 3512.48s]  Oh, there we go.
[3514.27s -> 3514.67s]  Okay.
[3514.67s -> 3519.47s]  We unlocked a sash, um, which is a plus six stunt chance.
[3521.49s -> 3521.97s]  Stunt.
[3523.31s -> 3524.03s]  Stunt.
[3524.03s -> 3524.83s]  That's like a crit.
[3524.83s -> 3527.79s]  Is it sounds like, yeah, it feels, I don't know, but I know you grow over it.
[3527.79s -> 3528.67s]  It doesn't even make sense.
[3528.67s -> 3533.55s]  Then percentage chance that attacks will inflict additional damage and stunt effects.
[3533.55s -> 3535.63s]  Oh, I think that's probably a wizard thing.
[3535.63s -> 3536.27s]  It's crit.
[3536.27s -> 3536.75s]  Oh, okay.
[3536.75s -> 3536.91s]  Yeah.
[3536.91s -> 3537.95s]  It's creating.
[3537.95s -> 3541.17s]  Is it spell crit or is it just regular attacks?
[3541.17s -> 3543.97s]  So I would assume not spells unless everything's an attack, but I don't.
[3543.97s -> 3545.41s]  Oh, really?
[3545.41s -> 3546.70s]  Attacks.
[3546.70s -> 3546.94s]  I don't know.
[3546.94s -> 3548.22s]  I think spells are an attack.
[3549.26s -> 3549.42s]  Yeah.
[3549.42s -> 3551.42s]  People saying ranger or mage would be a good choice.
[3551.42s -> 3553.26s]  So either of you guys, let's, let's give it to long.
[3553.26s -> 3554.30s]  That's cause he doesn't have anything yet.
[3554.30s -> 3555.10s]  I don't think.
[3555.10s -> 3555.42s]  Ooh.
[3556.06s -> 3558.24s]  I mean, I did become a wolf.
[3558.24s -> 3559.12s]  That is a thing.
[3559.12s -> 3559.36s]  Yeah.
[3560.16s -> 3562.32s]  You should be the ranged crit guy.
[3562.32s -> 3564.08s]  But Thomas already has a, yeah.
[3564.08s -> 3565.36s]  We got you the silk threads.
[3565.36s -> 3565.68s]  All right.
[3565.68s -> 3566.40s]  We're splitting it up.
[3566.40s -> 3567.20s]  We're even.
[3568.08s -> 3568.72s]  Okay.
[3568.72s -> 3572.16s]  So now I think we head for the demon wilds, right?
[3572.80s -> 3573.20s]  It's time.
[3574.00s -> 3576.00s]  I'm like really, really, really far.
[3576.72s -> 3576.88s]  Yeah.
[3576.88s -> 3580.64s]  Cause I'm noticing we have a countdown timer at the top until things get awful.
[3580.64s -> 3581.28s]  Yeah.
[3581.28s -> 3581.52s]  Yeah.
[3582.16s -> 3588.13s]  So, you know, it's a long journey, but you know, worth it to save the world and such.
[3589.17s -> 3589.65s]  Okay.
[3589.65s -> 3590.21s]  Yeah, I guess.
[3590.77s -> 3591.33s]  Oh no.
[3591.33s -> 3592.53s]  So the calamity has grown.
[3593.09s -> 3600.45s]  We now get Gorgons, Watchmen, Bogmores and Draven get extra help.
[3600.45s -> 3600.77s]  Okay.
[3601.65s -> 3602.69s]  So what do we have?
[3602.69s -> 3603.73s]  So these are our legacy points.
[3603.73s -> 3603.81s]  Yeah.
[3603.81s -> 3606.53s]  I think it's like, I think it's like some kind of abrasion on the camera.
[3606.53s -> 3609.73s]  Stop some of the things like, like, I don't want to read Gorgon.
[3609.73s -> 3612.85s]  Whatever it is like, like a glare on the lens.
[3612.85s -> 3614.29s]  Maybe calamity and spend one.
[3614.29s -> 3614.85s]  I'll get it figured out.
[3614.85s -> 3617.01s]  Or we can just let them all through and see what happens.
[3617.01s -> 3621.42s]  I don't, I don't want bow guys to be healthy guys.
[3622.06s -> 3623.74s]  Yeah, I like that.
[3623.74s -> 3624.78s]  I think we can handle the rest.
[3625.66s -> 3628.30s]  Although I did get blinded by a deer and I've never been the same.
[3629.98s -> 3631.49s]  I can't believe you lost an eye.
[3632.61s -> 3633.09s]  I know.
[3633.09s -> 3635.89s]  Well, I think I'd rather lose an eye than just have a wolf head.
[3638.37s -> 3639.25s]  That's all I wanted.
[3639.81s -> 3643.36s]  Okay.
[3643.36s -> 3649.28s]  The demon walls have been revealed and we have, we have an assault on Swine Side Copes.
[3650.85s -> 3651.17s]  Okay.
[3651.97s -> 3652.78s]  Okay.
[3653.42s -> 3655.39s]  We're attacking.
[3656.59s -> 3657.09s]  All right.
[3657.09s -> 3658.29s]  Would you like to be narrated now?
[3659.09s -> 3659.41s]  Yeah, sure.
[3659.41s -> 3660.13s]  I'll narrate a little bit.
[3661.81s -> 3665.41s]  The sun's fallen and the silver fog floats from the trees where shadows pool.
[3668.82s -> 3669.30s]  You can see it.
[3669.30s -> 3671.50s]  Wait, go back.
[3671.50s -> 3672.46s]  I didn't even notice it at first.
[3672.46s -> 3673.42s]  What happened?
[3673.42s -> 3674.38s]  My little dog is on the left.
[3674.38s -> 3675.82s]  Oh, you're just sitting there.
[3680.75s -> 3681.63s]  Along us.
[3681.63s -> 3682.59s]  Can you slow down?
[3683.15s -> 3684.59s]  And I won't want to lose you.
[3686.74s -> 3689.54s]  You're gonna have to keep me on a leash.
[3689.54s -> 3691.49s]  I thought that's what it actually said.
[3691.49s -> 3693.66s]  Said Mr. Nixon.
[3693.66s -> 3696.70s]  You're gonna have to keep me on a leash.
[3696.70s -> 3699.94s]  The quiet forms of fence around them.
[3699.94s -> 3701.46s]  Impenetrable.
[3701.46s -> 3704.58s]  The whirling air almost utterly opaque.
[3706.78s -> 3707.18s]  Inan!
[3708.64s -> 3710.80s]  You trust me, don't you?
[3710.80s -> 3712.08s]  Let's get to the trees.
[3712.72s -> 3716.30s]  At least those are solid.
[3716.30s -> 3718.78s]  They halt just inside the shelter of the pines.
[3719.66s -> 3721.26s]  Dark air clinging wet.
[3721.26s -> 3728.14s]  The trunks they press to dampen their palms.
[3728.14s -> 3729.58s]  Being lost with you isn't so bad.
[3733.23s -> 3734.11s]  I'm the one who's lost.
[3734.11s -> 3734.91s]  You guys are together.
[3735.87s -> 3739.15s]  And then suddenly, and then something vast moves beside them.
[3740.27s -> 3745.47s]  Slow, achingly slow.
[3745.47s -> 3747.63s]  It passes too enormous to be seen.
[3748.58s -> 3753.34s]  Impossibly silent.
[3753.34s -> 3753.84s]  What?
[3755.10s -> 3758.48s]  It's a tree.
[3758.48s -> 3759.76s]  It's just a regular tree.
[3759.76s -> 3761.20s]  Some kind of beast.
[3761.20s -> 3763.39s]  What's that Pokemon?
[3763.39s -> 3764.24s]  Why are we?
[3764.96s -> 3766.64s]  Who took this other picture?
[3766.64s -> 3767.84s]  Tradaru.
[3767.84s -> 3769.44s]  It's all AI generated.
[3769.44s -> 3770.40s]  That's the crazy thing.
[3770.40s -> 3771.12s]  Wait, so hold on.
[3771.84s -> 3772.96s]  Yeah, it's like, oh, look at this.
[3772.96s -> 3773.92s]  But look at this too.
[3773.92s -> 3775.12s]  This is a different, like, this is.
[3775.12s -> 3778.24s]  They're trying to like really emphasize this really weird silhouette.
[3779.87s -> 3781.23s]  Night's fallen.
[3781.23s -> 3782.91s]  The fog wanders away.
[3782.91s -> 3789.41s]  Clinging to the felty outline of that gargantuan shadow.
[3789.41s -> 3793.90s]  Oh, let's find Inan.
[3793.90s -> 3795.10s]  Maybe he saw it too.
[3795.10s -> 3795.98s]  Maybe he saw it better.
[3800.78s -> 3804.14s]  So, as long as it's choice will probably put you guys in a two-man combat.
[3804.14s -> 3805.90s]  Thomas's choice will find me first.
[3809.10s -> 3810.56s]  Okay.
[3810.56s -> 3813.52s]  I know you're beyond intrigued, but let's find Inan first.
[3814.08s -> 3816.08s]  Bad night to be chasing moon beams.
[3822.77s -> 3824.61s]  Oh, I'm the theater kid.
[3824.61s -> 3825.49s]  I'm the theater kid.
[3825.97s -> 3829.73s]  You are howling every chance you're grunting and growling.
[3829.73s -> 3832.29s]  I have told you this before.
[3832.29s -> 3833.49s]  The more I do this.
[3833.49s -> 3834.93s]  There's another word for that, Jeremy.
[3834.93s -> 3836.21s]  It's not theater kid.
[3836.21s -> 3842.37s]  During the audition at the school play, you went down on all fours.
[3842.37s -> 3845.41s]  And we're running around on the stage for the wolf character.
[3845.41s -> 3846.29s]  And nobody else did that.
[3846.29s -> 3848.13s]  Honestly, you want to know it's really cringe?
[3848.13s -> 3849.41s]  Not giving it your all.
[3849.41s -> 3851.02s]  That's true.
[3851.02s -> 3851.98s]  They meet in the open.
[3854.06s -> 3857.34s]  Crickets crackle again.
[3857.34s -> 3858.54s]  Finding the rhythm.
[3858.96s -> 3863.49s]  Somewhere, an owl pipes his blue notes.
[3863.49s -> 3865.89s]  We're here.
[3865.89s -> 3871.66s]  Apparently, Inan was also able to glimpse the shadowy giant as it passed.
[3871.66s -> 3874.94s]  Didn't see more than a black suggestion of its form.
[3874.94s -> 3879.02s]  I don't see a lot these days.
[3879.02s -> 3884.93s]  Then, as they're about to decide whether to set up camp or search for huge tracks by starlight,
[3884.93s -> 3887.17s]  the disturbance shakes the tree line.
[3887.17s -> 3896.86s]  Okay, we all get plus one temporary hit points.
[3896.86s -> 3897.98s]  You'll need it.
[3897.98s -> 3899.34s]  We're probably going to need it.
[3899.34s -> 3905.60s]  Okay, we have bogmores, rages, raccoons, and rose.
[3908.24s -> 3913.12s]  Heaving its overgrown body in mucusy plops, its grasping mouth drips and stinks.
[3914.62s -> 3916.54s]  And that fire spirit, we got to catch it.
[3916.54s -> 3917.74s]  It says it won't be here for long.
[3919.18s -> 3924.22s]  If we catch the fire spirit, it will actually give us like a legendary item.
[3924.22s -> 3925.58s]  Oh, I'm up.
[3925.58s -> 3926.06s]  I'm up here.
[3926.14s -> 3938.30s]  I'm going to send them just in case something comes, but we definitely Thomas is still using
[3938.30s -> 3941.26s]  a wooden spoon, even though we're in the second year of our journey.
[3941.26s -> 3943.26s]  So we probably need to get him something.
[3943.26s -> 3944.70s]  Why wouldn't I have just picked up a rock?
[3944.70s -> 3945.42s]  It would have been better.
[3946.30s -> 3950.13s]  Oh, okay.
[3950.13s -> 3951.17s]  Go for it, Thomas.
[3951.17s -> 3951.41s]  All right.
[3951.41s -> 3954.61s]  How do I think I don't know if we have to kill it.
[3954.61s -> 3955.01s]  There you go.
[3955.73s -> 3956.21s]  Caught you.
[3956.85s -> 3958.05s]  Do I get to make a wish now?
[3958.69s -> 3959.65s]  Okay.
[3959.65s -> 3966.85s]  So you can get a tier one fire wand or a legacy point.
[3966.85s -> 3969.33s]  I mean, the wand is definitely got to be it.
[3969.33s -> 3970.05s]  Yeah, for sure.
[3975.98s -> 3978.38s]  Fire damage definitely replaced the spoon.
[3979.10s -> 3979.42s]  Yeah.
[3979.42s -> 3982.14s]  Replace the soup spoon that you've been carrying.
[3982.14s -> 3982.38s]  Nice.
[3983.81s -> 3984.05s]  Cool.
[3984.05s -> 3988.05s]  And fire now has a stunt effect of damaging up to three nearby enemies.
[3989.01s -> 3990.05s]  Replacing gear is permanent.
[3990.69s -> 3991.73s]  That's the stunt effect.
[3994.29s -> 3994.53s]  Nice.
[3994.53s -> 3994.85s]  All right.
[3994.85s -> 3995.09s]  Cool.
[3996.18s -> 3999.22s]  So now I'm kind of out of the combat zone, though.
[3999.22s -> 4000.10s]  So it's okay.
[4000.10s -> 4000.90s]  I'm not going to push.
[4000.90s -> 4001.86s]  We're just going to let them come to us.
[4004.98s -> 4005.54s]  Good shot.
[4013.62s -> 4014.10s]  Oh, shit.
[4014.10s -> 4015.06s]  That's big.
[4015.06s -> 4015.62s]  Whatever that is.
[4017.65s -> 4018.85s]  Oh, not again.
[4018.85s -> 4019.33s]  Oh, no.
[4021.89s -> 4024.61s]  Is this on like masochist difficulty?
[4028.37s -> 4029.49s]  I'm going to see if I can blow the tree up.
[4031.46s -> 4032.34s]  Is it going to hurt you?
[4033.06s -> 4034.16s]  I don't think so.
[4034.16s -> 4035.20s]  I don't think you can friendly fire.
[4035.84s -> 4037.36s]  See if I can pop both these.
[4040.50s -> 4041.70s]  I actually can hurt you.
[4042.34s -> 4044.86s]  Can I hit them both from here?
[4044.86s -> 4045.82s]  There we go.
[4045.82s -> 4048.45s]  They blocked it.
[4048.45s -> 4049.25s]  I'm dead.
[4049.25s -> 4049.75s]  No.
[4052.19s -> 4053.55s]  I'll save you.
[4055.58s -> 4057.17s]  Oh, no, you're good.
[4058.43s -> 4058.93s]  We lived.
[4060.93s -> 4061.43s]  No.
[4061.89s -> 4062.45s]  Oh, gosh.
[4066.22s -> 4067.18s]  That thing is huge.
[4067.18s -> 4068.22s]  This thing is terrifying.
[4068.22s -> 4069.74s]  I think we're all dead, by the way.
[4071.55s -> 4073.07s]  We need your magic, Stamble, than ever.
[4075.79s -> 4077.39s]  I can try and finish off this guy.
[4077.39s -> 4077.87s]  I think I can.
[4078.43s -> 4080.35s]  I can pin this person here, I think.
[4080.67s -> 4081.79s]  If I do this.
[4081.79s -> 4083.98s]  Oh, the Bogmaw?
[4084.54s -> 4085.42s]  I can try it.
[4085.42s -> 4086.62s]  Wait, am I moving him?
[4086.62s -> 4088.22s]  If you pin him, he loses his movement next turn.
[4088.22s -> 4088.72s]  That's good.
[4089.42s -> 4092.62s]  This plant sends out tendrils that grab and draw in an enemy,
[4092.62s -> 4094.14s]  dealing damage and pinning them.
[4094.14s -> 4094.78s]  I'm going to try it.
[4094.78s -> 4096.38s]  I could run away after the fact.
[4096.38s -> 4096.70s]  Yeah.
[4096.70s -> 4097.26s]  See if it works.
[4098.70s -> 4099.94s]  Oh, you hit him.
[4100.66s -> 4101.54s]  And you killed them.
[4101.54s -> 4102.04s]  Whoa.
[4104.21s -> 4105.89s]  All in a day's work, is what I'm saying.
[4105.89s -> 4109.42s]  I get a swift action free wolf bite,
[4109.42s -> 4111.82s]  but I think I can't use it because I'm holding a bow.
[4113.58s -> 4115.66s]  I think you can't use it because you're not in melee range.
[4116.30s -> 4118.78s]  No, I was trying to do it to the deer when it was next to me.
[4118.78s -> 4120.42s]  Okay.
[4121.12s -> 4122.16s]  Oh, oh, it's okay.
[4122.16s -> 4122.88s]  It's only cardinal.
[4124.32s -> 4125.60s]  This raccoon is just going to keep shooting.
[4125.60s -> 4127.36s]  Maybe I run off to him.
[4127.36s -> 4129.82s]  I feel like that's probably less dangerous.
[4131.26s -> 4132.30s]  You ran off to it.
[4134.22s -> 4136.19s]  You want to try and finish it?
[4137.60s -> 4138.56s]  Then I start a blast.
[4138.56s -> 4144.45s]  Oh, that's actually helpful.
[4144.45s -> 4144.95s]  Nice.
[4150.86s -> 4151.74s]  All right, we're okay.
[4151.74s -> 4152.70s]  This is corruption.
[4152.70s -> 4154.40s]  I wonder if I can reach from here.
[4163.20s -> 4164.24s]  Wait, that took two actions.
[4164.24s -> 4165.44s]  I was going to go nuts.
[4165.44s -> 4166.96s]  Yeah, you moved really far.
[4166.96s -> 4167.20s]  Okay.
[4167.20s -> 4168.08s]  Well, I wanted to eat it.
[4168.64s -> 4168.88s]  All right.
[4168.88s -> 4169.68s]  What if I do this?
[4169.68s -> 4170.72s]  Hopefully this doesn't hurt you guys.
[4177.31s -> 4177.71s]  What?
[4177.71s -> 4179.07s]  Oh, no, he dodged.
[4182.27s -> 4182.77s]  There we go.
[4185.74s -> 4186.24s]  All right.
[4187.18s -> 4188.70s]  That was that was big.
[4188.70s -> 4189.20s]  That worked.
[4189.98s -> 4193.01s]  I did not think we were going to make it out of that.
[4193.01s -> 4193.57s]  That was good.
[4193.57s -> 4193.81s]  All right.
[4193.81s -> 4197.25s]  We got a talisman of power ancient charm to hang around your waist.
[4198.66s -> 4201.46s]  I think you should take this because you're going to be always up in front
[4201.46s -> 4203.70s]  and you're going to always take hits.
[4203.70s -> 4205.62s]  So you should be dealing damage at the front.
[4205.62s -> 4207.14s]  Maybe we should save something.
[4207.14s -> 4209.38s]  Like I should wear like more tanky stuff.
[4209.38s -> 4210.58s]  We should give you guys the damage.
[4210.58s -> 4211.06s]  Give it to me.
[4211.06s -> 4211.86s]  Give it to me.
[4211.86s -> 4212.50s]  Give it to me.
[4212.50s -> 4214.82s]  That puts a long us up to one bonus damage.
[4214.82s -> 4216.50s]  So he would do one extra damage.
[4216.50s -> 4217.30s]  I need one second.
[4217.30s -> 4218.34s]  Can you guys hear me?
[4218.34s -> 4218.58s]  Yeah.
[4218.58s -> 4219.22s]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[4219.78s -> 4220.26s]  Okay.
[4220.26s -> 4223.70s]  Oh, I think I like kicked my Wi-Fi or my router out.
[4223.70s -> 4226.42s]  You're you're like breaking up a little bit.
[4226.42s -> 4228.50s]  Wait, do you actually physically kicked it with your feet?
[4229.38s -> 4232.19s]  Okay, let's just freeze it.
[4232.19s -> 4234.59s]  You want to take like a should we take like a two minute break or something like him?
[4235.47s -> 4237.07s]  Yeah, we take a two second break.
[4237.07s -> 4238.35s]  Yeah, maybe like two minutes.
[4238.99s -> 4240.75s]  Yeah, I'll make some coffee.
[4240.75s -> 4241.25s]  Cool.
[4245.36s -> 4247.60s]  I want to take a little break whilst the sorts of stuff now.
[4247.60s -> 4248.56s]  You enjoying it?
[4248.56s -> 4249.44s]  No, this is great.
[4249.44s -> 4253.44s]  This is I so for people that have no idea what's going on.
[4254.08s -> 4256.56s]  You can grab your coffee because I want to explain a little more detail.
[4256.56s -> 4257.44s]  Go for it.
[4257.44s -> 4258.70s]  I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[4258.70s -> 4261.74s]  Yeah, I think I kicked like the power cable halfway out.
[4261.74s -> 4262.14s]  Really?
[4262.14s -> 4262.70s]  Modem.
[4262.70s -> 4264.62s]  So my internet was like half out.
[4265.26s -> 4265.82s]  It was weird.
[4267.52s -> 4268.72s]  But yeah, we'll be back in two minutes.
[4270.50s -> 4271.14s]  Cool.
[4271.14s -> 4274.03s]  So just before I go BRB, we're just going to take a quick two minute break.
[4274.03s -> 4275.63s]  But for those of you that don't know what's going on,
[4276.19s -> 4277.31s]  if you were like what the hell is going on,
[4277.31s -> 4279.15s]  we kind of jumped right into it because I was a little late.
[4280.67s -> 4282.58s]  This is all AI generated.
[4282.58s -> 4289.14s]  So this whole game is a procedurally generated RPG AI D&D like.
[4291.26s -> 4295.26s]  Not everything is AI and procedure generated.
[4295.26s -> 4295.50s]  I know.
[4295.50s -> 4297.02s]  Yeah, but a lot of stuff is.
[4298.69s -> 4300.69s]  It's sort of just like a procedurally generated RPG.
[4302.59s -> 4303.87s]  Not everything.
[4303.87s -> 4304.75s]  It's not AI.
[4304.75s -> 4306.35s]  Well, I keep saying that it's stupid.
[4307.15s -> 4307.79s]  That's the wrong thing.
[4307.79s -> 4308.35s]  But you know what I mean?
[4308.35s -> 4312.85s]  It's just like random stuff that they plug in.
[4313.57s -> 4316.05s]  RPG D&D or ADHD.
[4316.93s -> 4321.65s]  But yeah, if you're curious as to like why is all this stuff so weird,
[4322.69s -> 4327.04s]  it's because it's just generating it.
[4327.04s -> 4332.00s]  And my camera, I have no idea why that was happening.
[4332.00s -> 4337.92s]  I think it honestly was because the way the light was bouncing off the wall.
[4337.92s -> 4338.16s]  I don't know.
[4338.16s -> 4338.96s]  I'll have to figure that out.
[4339.28s -> 4340.32s]  It seems to be gone now.
[4340.32s -> 4342.50s]  But this is really fun.
[4342.50s -> 4344.43s]  This is funny.
[4344.43s -> 4346.35s]  I'm going to take two quick seconds.
[4346.35s -> 4572.11s]  I'll be right back.
[4572.11s -> 4572.35s]  Yeah.
[4572.35s -> 4572.99s]  Hello.
[4572.99s -> 4574.05s]  I'm back.
[4574.05s -> 4575.01s]  Hey, welcome back.
[4575.01s -> 4575.73s]  I'm ready.
[4575.73s -> 4576.29s]  We're all ready.
[4576.29s -> 4577.25s]  I think we're good to go.
[4578.13s -> 4578.85s]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[4578.85s -> 4582.21s]  I was thinking this game is so good if you like want to try D&D,
[4582.21s -> 4584.85s]  but you don't have a friend who's a DM because the game is the DM.
[4585.89s -> 4586.05s]  Yeah.
[4586.05s -> 4589.09s]  So can you correct me when we were on break?
[4589.09s -> 4589.81s]  I was talking about it.
[4589.81s -> 4591.81s]  Is there is it AI?
[4593.31s -> 4593.95s]  Yeah.
[4593.95s -> 4597.15s]  Yeah, it's all like every no adventure will be the same.
[4597.15s -> 4598.35s]  It's like procedurally generated.
[4598.35s -> 4602.67s]  There's like certain campaigns, but they have like not every campaign
[4602.67s -> 4604.51s]  is going to have a wolf head and I'm not going to lose an eye.
[4604.51s -> 4605.07s]  Right.
[4605.07s -> 4605.71s]  It's all AI.
[4606.51s -> 4612.99s]  I believe like to an extent that there are like events that happen,
[4612.99s -> 4617.33s]  like the wolf head, but it is still like phrased differently, I assume.
[4617.33s -> 4621.01s]  The scenarios are written, but like what happens is kind of like
[4621.01s -> 4623.49s]  all thrown into an AI and then like thrown at you.
[4623.49s -> 4625.81s]  So it's just like a like a jumbler essentially.
[4625.81s -> 4626.29s]  That's interesting.
[4626.29s -> 4626.69s]  That's cool.
[4626.69s -> 4627.60s]  Yeah.
[4627.60s -> 4630.64s]  So like certain stories, so you can see at the top this this particular
[4630.64s -> 4633.36s]  like encounter we found ourselves in is called silver and shadows
[4633.36s -> 4634.64s]  and it tells you who the writer is.
[4634.64s -> 4635.92s]  So someone wrote this story.
[4635.92s -> 4637.12s]  Oh, oh, all right.
[4638.88s -> 4642.42s]  But the AI kind of like puts everything in a timeline
[4642.42s -> 4645.22s]  and then like, you know, throws the events at us and that kind of stuff.
[4645.22s -> 4646.02s]  That's cool.
[4646.02s -> 4646.58s]  All right.
[4646.58s -> 4648.53s]  I'm you guys ready to go?
[4648.53s -> 4649.73s]  Yes, let's do it.
[4651.55s -> 4655.97s]  The fight has brought them back under the bows of the wood.
[4655.97s -> 4658.83s]  I think it's quiet.
[4658.83s -> 4660.27s]  I hate a night battle.
[4660.35s -> 4662.91s]  Keep knocking into pronounced bows.
[4662.91s -> 4666.90s]  Can you stop, please?
[4666.90s -> 4668.26s]  Keep knocking into trees.
[4668.26s -> 4672.02s]  It's too late.
[4672.02s -> 4675.38s]  They make a broad search for sign of the giant's passing,
[4675.38s -> 4680.62s]  but are forced to camp precious hours from sunrise having found nothing.
[4680.62s -> 4685.74s]  Still, the story does quite well in taverns.
[4685.74s -> 4689.02s]  And those who saw it dream of a colossal being,
[4689.02s -> 4693.28s]  all shadowy gray, silver, fog, and overwhelming giant.
[4693.28s -> 4696.51s]  They dream of seeing it again one day.
[4696.51s -> 4700.18s]  They dream for years and years.
[4700.18s -> 4703.94s]  I'm in the corner like, yeah, I'm above all this human stuff now.
[4703.94s -> 4706.75s]  All right, three legacy points.
[4706.75s -> 4709.47s]  Is this implying that we spent years just hanging out?
[4709.47s -> 4709.95s]  Yes.
[4709.95s -> 4710.99s]  This might be a time skip.
[4712.08s -> 4713.84s]  We just got a three year time skip?
[4717.71s -> 4718.75s]  We needed a break.
[4718.75s -> 4719.07s]  Hold on.
[4719.07s -> 4723.39s]  Did we just spend three years telling everybody how cool we are for fighting in the woods?
[4724.90s -> 4729.06s]  I think it's more like it's telling us it's the narrator saying
[4729.06s -> 4730.98s]  that this will happen for years to come.
[4730.98s -> 4732.98s]  Like people will tell the stories for years to come.
[4733.54s -> 4735.22s]  We're still in our second year of our adventure,
[4735.22s -> 4738.66s]  but he's kind of like saying people will talk about their deeds for years to come.
[4738.66s -> 4739.06s]  Yeah.
[4739.06s -> 4739.30s]  Okay.
[4739.30s -> 4740.02s]  Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.
[4740.02s -> 4744.82s]  Okay. So we can go to the Hallenwilds or the night top.
[4744.82s -> 4746.10s]  You know, this is year two.
[4746.10s -> 4747.46s]  So it was a time skip.
[4747.46s -> 4752.10s]  Yeah. So we can, if you mouse over the Hallenwild seems to be infested with Gorgons.
[4752.10s -> 4753.46s]  They may ambush our group.
[4754.50s -> 4756.74s]  And the other one is Draven, which may ambush our group.
[4758.10s -> 4761.46s]  If we check our card deck again, our calamities by pressing B
[4762.10s -> 4766.82s]  or clicking the one in the top right, we can see that the Gorgons are kind of stacked.
[4767.54s -> 4767.94s]  They are.
[4767.94s -> 4771.14s]  And the Draven look kind of weak by comparison.
[4771.86s -> 4773.22s]  So it might be worth...
[4773.22s -> 4777.14s]  Oh yeah. And we avoided the one Draven once.
[4777.14s -> 4777.70s]  Let's Draven.
[4777.70s -> 4779.54s]  Yeah. So let's go Draven.
[4779.54s -> 4781.22s]  Cause I think that's like the safer bet.
[4781.22s -> 4781.70s]  Good idea.
[4783.14s -> 4784.90s]  Cause we are very injured right now, actually.
[4784.90s -> 4785.14s]  What?
[4785.14s -> 4787.22s]  And you'll see that we're healing over time as we travel.
[4787.22s -> 4790.58s]  Wait, wait, two years passed and we're hurt?
[4791.30s -> 4794.02s]  No, it was the narrator.
[4794.02s -> 4795.86s]  It was confusing, but it was the narrator saying that
[4796.50s -> 4798.90s]  people would be talking about our stories for years to come.
[4798.90s -> 4800.90s]  But the top says year two, day 20.
[4800.90s -> 4804.10s]  That's yeah, that's our entire journey so far has been two years.
[4804.90s -> 4807.49s]  Randomly generated.
[4807.49s -> 4809.90s]  Yeah. It's, you know, I'm angrily traveling.
[4809.90s -> 4813.34s]  Okay. Well, Assault Viv Mia shop is our thing.
[4814.06s -> 4816.38s]  I'm low health, but I think we can do it.
[4817.71s -> 4820.91s]  We can also choose if you see at the bottom right,
[4820.91s -> 4823.07s]  you can see that we don't just have an assault choice.
[4823.07s -> 4825.71s]  We have a patrol choice, which will send our party to clear
[4825.71s -> 4828.91s]  the infestation on the tile and reduce the strength of the enemy.
[4828.91s -> 4831.63s]  So we can spend some time just like kind of scouting.
[4833.26s -> 4835.18s]  How, how certain are we going to lose this?
[4837.23s -> 4839.07s]  It's, it, it's strength four.
[4839.87s -> 4841.79s]  If we clear it, it'll become a strength three.
[4841.79s -> 4842.11s]  Okay.
[4842.11s -> 4843.15s]  We like patrol.
[4843.15s -> 4843.79s]  See if we can do it.
[4844.99s -> 4846.03s]  Yeah, there we go.
[4846.03s -> 4849.31s]  Okay. So now it's a strength three, which is more doable and I healed up.
[4849.31s -> 4850.11s]  Perfect.
[4850.11s -> 4851.07s]  So this is perfect.
[4856.42s -> 4873.74s]  Oh, a little nervous.
[4873.74s -> 4877.68s]  Telling myself it's all birds and mice out there.
[4877.68s -> 4881.65s]  You click.
[4881.65s -> 4884.82s]  Of course I'm tense.
[4884.82s -> 4888.06s]  Moments before a battle, I get all squeezed up inside.
[4888.06s -> 4888.86s]  I'm good.
[4888.86s -> 4892.29s]  That's it.
[4894.77s -> 4899.26s]  Yeah. What?
[4900.22s -> 4903.82s]  We gained temporary damage of potency because you, you, uh, yeah.
[4903.82s -> 4906.78s]  Apparently my incredible simple overconfidence.
[4907.34s -> 4909.82s]  Yeah. Through the power of like toxic masculinity,
[4909.82s -> 4913.02s]  you put up a front that you had to deal with this.
[4913.02s -> 4914.14s]  Hey, I appreciate that.
[4914.14s -> 4915.74s]  Yep. I'm good.
[4915.74s -> 4916.94s]  Yup. I'm good.
[4916.94s -> 4917.34s]  Me too.
[4917.98s -> 4918.54s]  Yep. Same.
[4919.18s -> 4926.66s]  Okay. So this is a small area and dots.
[4927.30s -> 4931.10s]  Okay.
[4934.43s -> 4936.43s]  I think I'm, I'm, I'm kind of scared.
[4936.43s -> 4937.23s]  I'm going to stay back.
[4939.23s -> 4940.67s]  That scarecrow is blocking the path.
[4941.39s -> 4942.27s]  Open fire.
[4944.13s -> 4945.25s]  Oh, oh my God.
[4946.48s -> 4946.72s]  Nice.
[4946.80s -> 4947.12s]  Strong.
[4949.17s -> 4953.66s]  Okay. I'm going to, yeah, I'll jump here and then I'm going to sentinel.
[4953.66s -> 4954.86s]  If they get too close.
[4954.86s -> 4956.30s]  I'm going to infuse the wagon.
[4956.30s -> 4957.50s]  If they walk near the way.
[4957.50s -> 4959.18s]  Actually, let me see if I can do it now.
[4959.18s -> 4959.58s]  I can.
[4960.64s -> 4962.48s]  All right. I'm going to do a, I'm going to do a blast.
[4962.48s -> 4962.88s]  That's huge.
[4964.16s -> 4970.26s]  Oh, let me do this again.
[4971.50s -> 4974.42s]  Um, actually I was going to move.
[4975.14s -> 4976.10s]  I'm going to get a better spot.
[4981.39s -> 4984.75s]  I have never heard of a player like being a werewolf and using a bow.
[4987.23s -> 4988.67s]  Who has that like fantasy?
[4989.31s -> 4991.23s]  I mean, into a wolf and just pick up a bow.
[4991.23s -> 4996.19s]  Imagine a situation where you can identify an enemy location via your sense of smell.
[4996.91s -> 5000.11s]  So even in like pitch darkness, you're an excellent ranger.
[5000.67s -> 5003.23s]  Yeah. I don't believe all the dogs are good at smelling stuff.
[5003.23s -> 5004.35s]  My dog is an idiot.
[5004.35s -> 5006.59s]  Like there's no way it's smelling stuff that I can't smell.
[5006.59s -> 5007.47s]  Okay. But you're not a dog.
[5007.47s -> 5008.67s]  You're a wolf, man.
[5008.67s -> 5010.99s]  Yeah. You're a, you're a, well, you're a wolf.
[5010.99s -> 5012.03s]  Um, wolf head.
[5012.03s -> 5012.83s]  I'm not buying it.
[5013.55s -> 5014.75s]  I'm not buying it.
[5014.75s -> 5015.47s]  Okay.
[5015.47s -> 5016.43s]  It's propaganda.
[5016.99s -> 5018.43s]  Gemma, how are you liking the wizard?
[5019.07s -> 5020.03s]  It's fun.
[5020.03s -> 5023.39s]  I like the, you kind of have to tap into scenery and then blow up scenery.
[5023.39s -> 5025.55s]  I don't know if I'm, I don't think I have like a regular attack.
[5025.55s -> 5026.51s]  Maybe I'm not close enough.
[5027.31s -> 5028.51s]  No, I think this is it.
[5028.51s -> 5028.83s]  Yeah.
[5028.83s -> 5030.03s]  Yeah. I have a strike.
[5030.83s -> 5038.86s]  Yeah. I forgot that you do like insane fire damage because you're warm.
[5038.86s -> 5039.82s]  Yeah. I think it's crazy.
[5039.82s -> 5041.66s]  I need to start doing that more often instead of blow up.
[5042.62s -> 5049.94s]  Oh, I leveled in and dogwood is now a blood horn warrior.
[5049.94s -> 5050.66s]  Ooh.
[5050.66s -> 5051.46s]  I can interrupt.
[5051.46s -> 5052.82s]  I can upgrade my central move.
[5052.82s -> 5053.86s]  I can go untouchable.
[5054.58s -> 5058.34s]  When Inon gets a kill, the next attack against him within one turn will miss.
[5058.34s -> 5059.46s]  That seems really good.
[5059.46s -> 5060.90s]  That does seem great.
[5060.90s -> 5063.87s]  Um, yeah, I really like that.
[5063.87s -> 5065.95s]  I, because I keep getting my ass beat.
[5065.95s -> 5066.35s]  Ooh.
[5066.35s -> 5071.94s]  A fang axe, tier one axe plus one damage to drawmen.
[5072.90s -> 5076.42s]  It does bonus damage to drawmen forged by long dead roamers of the wild lands.
[5078.74s -> 5082.58s]  So we can either give this to one of you guys just so you have like an alternative weapon
[5082.66s -> 5085.14s]  or I can just take it for when we fight drawmen.
[5085.86s -> 5086.98s]  Is this better than what you have?
[5088.02s -> 5090.42s]  Uh, it's, I think it's about this.
[5090.42s -> 5093.94s]  It's the same as what I have, but it has more shred and stunt damage,
[5094.66s -> 5097.54s]  but I also have an empty weapon slot so I can like carry both.
[5099.34s -> 5099.66s]  Hmm.
[5101.12s -> 5103.60s]  Um, but you don't have like a melee weapon per se.
[5103.60s -> 5107.36s]  So if you want like something, just in case something's in your face or you don't have any,
[5108.24s -> 5111.28s]  uh, scenery to play, to pull from, we can do that too.
[5112.24s -> 5116.83s]  Um, I, I think it's just go to, uh, can I, do I do very much melee damage?
[5117.63s -> 5121.26s]  Um, I think the damage is dependent on the weapon itself.
[5121.26s -> 5126.78s]  So it says five damage on the weapon and I think like damage is just like,
[5126.78s -> 5129.10s]  if you get plus damage gear, it would apply to everything you do.
[5129.98s -> 5132.80s]  I mean, if I'll take it and put it in my other slot.
[5133.52s -> 5133.84s]  Yeah.
[5133.84s -> 5135.28s]  If, uh, if it's not better than what you have.
[5136.00s -> 5137.84s]  No, it's, it's the same as what I have.
[5137.84s -> 5138.40s]  All right.
[5138.40s -> 5138.96s]  Yeah, that's good.
[5140.16s -> 5140.72s]  Yeah, cool.
[5140.72s -> 5141.60s]  Cool.
[5141.68s -> 5145.28s]  And then we get the phone shadow pauldrons, which gives five dodge.
[5146.91s -> 5147.63s]  You should dodge.
[5148.35s -> 5149.25s]  Let's see.
[5149.25s -> 5152.27s]  I do not want to see another eye come out.
[5152.27s -> 5153.63s]  Uh, everyone's saying Austin.
[5153.63s -> 5153.87s]  Yep.
[5155.66s -> 5156.14s]  It didn't.
[5156.14s -> 5156.94s]  Austin, did you announce it?
[5156.94s -> 5158.30s]  Are these tanky though?
[5158.30s -> 5160.96s]  I feel like they might be a ranger thing.
[5160.96s -> 5161.70s]  Just take them.
[5162.42s -> 5165.70s]  And then if you get a tanky thing, just we can trade it later, right?
[5165.70s -> 5171.14s]  Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be flying in a, uh, in a plane simulation with Austin
[5171.14s -> 5171.86s]  in a couple of days.
[5172.80s -> 5173.68s]  It's gonna be wild.
[5173.68s -> 5174.96s]  Go check the Twitter.
[5174.96s -> 5175.76s]  I'll retweet that too.
[5175.76s -> 5176.72s]  What a minute.
[5176.72s -> 5177.84s]  If only he dodged.
[5181.79s -> 5183.55s]  We came out losing very little.
[5183.55s -> 5186.75s]  Some ripped scuffs and notches, but mostly clean.
[5186.75s -> 5187.95s]  That's a worthy day's work.
[5188.99s -> 5190.27s]  I don't know how I get.
[5190.27s -> 5193.31s]  I don't trust simple success as irrational as them.
[5197.20s -> 5198.40s]  Jesus Christ.
[5199.49s -> 5201.89s]  You think of all the stuff that's out there.
[5202.45s -> 5203.01s]  Evil.
[5203.65s -> 5204.45s]  Yeah.
[5204.45s -> 5205.81s]  Or just hungry.
[5206.45s -> 5210.91s]  Could come rampaging into our midst and take one of us away.
[5210.91s -> 5212.75s]  Makes me frustrated.
[5212.75s -> 5215.47s]  How fragile we all still are.
[5216.19s -> 5217.87s]  Someone asked if he was Scooby-Doo.
[5218.75s -> 5225.95s]  Yeah, I was gonna say you're getting into like, like, like, no, like ape territory.
[5225.95s -> 5229.95s]  Like, I think he's just, just general beast.
[5229.95s -> 5230.35s]  Yeah.
[5230.35s -> 5230.99s]  General beast.
[5230.99s -> 5231.23s]  Okay.
[5231.23s -> 5233.23s]  I was like, I was a person before.
[5233.23s -> 5234.59s]  I don't know what it is to be a wolf.
[5234.83s -> 5236.91s]  You are quite close to just, yeah.
[5236.91s -> 5238.91s]  I'm more a man than I am wolf.
[5239.55s -> 5240.03s]  Okay.
[5240.03s -> 5242.19s]  So the Draven got stronger.
[5242.19s -> 5244.19s]  They learned from their defeat.
[5244.19s -> 5246.14s]  Oh, but that's okay.
[5246.14s -> 5247.26s]  That's their first card.
[5247.26s -> 5248.45s]  So it's not a big deal.
[5249.66s -> 5255.49s]  Do we want to secure the, the, the shop or do we want to press on?
[5256.13s -> 5257.68s]  Does that mean we can buy stuff?
[5258.70s -> 5261.18s]  It means we can get an item like we got last time.
[5261.18s -> 5263.22s]  Ooh, secure.
[5263.94s -> 5264.50s]  We're greedy.
[5264.50s -> 5266.42s]  Yeah, I say secure.
[5266.42s -> 5267.62s]  Let's find an item then.
[5267.62s -> 5269.38s]  I'm in the mood for some scaring and discovering.
[5269.38s -> 5271.22s]  We can set this place right as we go, can't we?
[5272.10s -> 5273.70s]  Investigate thoroughly.
[5273.70s -> 5273.94s]  Okay.
[5282.98s -> 5283.62s]  Nice job.
[5284.42s -> 5284.90s]  All right.
[5284.90s -> 5285.78s]  Secure complete.
[5286.74s -> 5287.54s]  You look so happy.
[5289.78s -> 5292.98s]  Study the world and you'll never finish discovering wonders.
[5293.70s -> 5295.06s]  Looks like you guys are playing fetch.
[5295.95s -> 5296.67s]  Yeah, it does.
[5298.66s -> 5300.34s]  Somebody want to take a narrator?
[5300.34s -> 5303.20s]  So we've unlocked.
[5303.20s -> 5304.64s]  No, I think you're doing a great job.
[5304.64s -> 5305.28s]  Okay.
[5305.28s -> 5312.00s]  So a thorough delving through the mysteries of Viv Mia shop has proven rewarding.
[5312.00s -> 5314.98s]  Viv Mia shop will return to the hands of the common folk.
[5315.54s -> 5320.18s]  While they tend to the site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.
[5320.18s -> 5325.46s]  You've got two leaves and one of those.
[5325.46s -> 5332.21s]  Click done and we should get a weapon.
[5332.21s -> 5332.69s]  There we go.
[5332.69s -> 5340.40s]  Warding is star slate necklace and warding is absorbing magic damage.
[5341.38s -> 5343.70s]  Somebody rather you for being up front, right?
[5343.70s -> 5344.18s]  Yeah.
[5344.18s -> 5345.14s]  Yeah, I'd go for it.
[5346.94s -> 5347.42s]  Okay.
[5347.42s -> 5350.06s]  So if you guys look in the top left of the screen,
[5350.06s -> 5353.02s]  you'll see that along us is currently glowing and he has an icon.
[5353.90s -> 5356.46s]  So that means that he has a side quest that we can pursue.
[5357.54s -> 5358.58s]  I mean, let's do it.
[5358.58s -> 5360.18s]  If we click that side quest.
[5363.18s -> 5365.10s]  How long has it been?
[5368.43s -> 5369.71s]  Haven't I wait.
[5369.71s -> 5372.03s]  I forgot how you like change the reader.
[5372.91s -> 5373.47s]  Oh, yeah.
[5373.47s -> 5376.11s]  Just is it just when I press next, I like took it.
[5376.11s -> 5376.27s]  Yeah.
[5376.27s -> 5377.79s]  So we had to check the box.
[5377.79s -> 5379.23s]  We're just reading along with you now.
[5379.23s -> 5382.11s]  Haven't cracked a book in ages.
[5382.99s -> 5386.27s]  How long since I've felt inspired?
[5386.27s -> 5387.55s]  See a more man.
[5387.55s -> 5392.93s]  Well, you're turning into like Arthur Morgan.
[5392.93s -> 5396.40s]  I've been through a lot along us.
[5396.40s -> 5397.20s]  Why you vote here?
[5400.75s -> 5404.03s]  You won't suppose to find my note until tomorrow.
[5404.03s -> 5405.28s]  Here.
[5405.28s -> 5409.52s]  I thought I was being nice, letting you rest.
[5409.52s -> 5410.08s]  Yeah.
[5410.08s -> 5411.36s]  No, you are.
[5411.92s -> 5415.28s]  I just wanted some time.
[5421.02s -> 5423.58s]  I don't know what it is really.
[5423.58s -> 5429.09s]  Mind if I keep you company?
[5429.09s -> 5431.42s]  I'm sure you can come.
[5434.54s -> 5434.86s]  Okay.
[5434.86s -> 5436.54s]  Just let me get my travel things.
[5436.54s -> 5441.46s]  You have any idea where we're off to?
[5441.46s -> 5442.02s]  I don't know.
[5442.82s -> 5444.10s]  Where are we going?
[5444.10s -> 5449.14s]  I left you a note and I didn't really think beyond that.
[5449.14s -> 5451.31s]  We have options.
[5452.11s -> 5454.19s]  I need to spark my mind somehow.
[5454.19s -> 5455.79s]  I need to become inspired.
[5457.49s -> 5464.43s]  And that case isn't the bar a good place to start.
[5464.43s -> 5466.75s]  No, it's beyond the horizon.
[5467.15s -> 5467.47s]  Face.
[5467.47s -> 5468.59s]  He gives it number two.
[5468.59s -> 5469.07s]  Like, what?
[5469.07s -> 5469.95s]  I didn't think of that.
[5471.57s -> 5472.45s]  What are you doing?
[5472.45s -> 5473.33s]  I chose the bar.
[5473.33s -> 5474.69s]  I didn't think of that.
[5474.69s -> 5476.46s]  That was clever.
[5476.46s -> 5476.62s]  Yeah.
[5476.62s -> 5480.30s]  I love how your side quest is let's go get a drink for like a half hour.
[5480.30s -> 5483.04s]  I've just been running around in the woods.
[5483.04s -> 5485.68s]  I can click it again.
[5485.68s -> 5487.46s]  It's the same.
[5487.46s -> 5489.92s]  Did we just complete it?
[5489.92s -> 5490.48s]  Okay.
[5490.48s -> 5493.22s]  I think you didn't.
[5493.22s -> 5493.54s]  I think.
[5493.54s -> 5494.66s]  Oh, I think you have to.
[5494.66s -> 5495.95s]  You got to select one.
[5495.95s -> 5496.19s]  Yeah.
[5496.19s -> 5496.99s]  I did select.
[5496.99s -> 5502.08s]  I think the selecting that one is making it because I'm choosing number two.
[5502.08s -> 5504.88s]  Maybe the bar is like it's just ending your adventure.
[5504.88s -> 5508.96s]  It's suspending the side quest because it's like you're not actually leaving on a journey.
[5508.96s -> 5510.16s]  You're just going to the bar.
[5510.16s -> 5512.14s]  Oh, let's choose.
[5512.14s -> 5512.38s]  Yeah.
[5513.18s -> 5513.58s]  Okay.
[5514.38s -> 5519.02s]  I guess somehow throughout this, I was just third wheeling behind you guys carrying like
[5519.02s -> 5520.30s]  the wagon or something.
[5520.30s -> 5521.26s]  That's so funny.
[5521.26s -> 5522.48s]  I'm here.
[5522.48s -> 5524.74s]  I know we're big time.
[5524.74s -> 5525.06s]  Wow.
[5525.06s -> 5526.02s]  Look at this journey.
[5526.58s -> 5528.18s]  Oh, my God.
[5528.18s -> 5529.94s]  We're going so far.
[5529.94s -> 5532.34s]  We're going back to the altar where I transformed.
[5532.34s -> 5535.84s]  This is like a seven month journey.
[5535.84s -> 5536.08s]  Yeah.
[5536.72s -> 5537.76s]  You guys are my best friends.
[5537.76s -> 5538.48s]  Oh, no.
[5538.48s -> 5540.48s]  Things got really bad in our absence as well.
[5542.13s -> 5543.33s]  We have so many points.
[5543.33s -> 5544.61s]  Let's just like just.
[5544.61s -> 5545.81s]  I think I want to can't.
[5545.81s -> 5545.97s]  Yeah.
[5545.97s -> 5547.01s]  You want to just cancel a little bit.
[5548.27s -> 5549.79s]  We're not fighting anything.
[5549.79s -> 5550.83s]  Pass everything.
[5550.83s -> 5551.39s]  Nothing happened.
[5551.39s -> 5552.19s]  No clammies.
[5552.19s -> 5554.27s]  We're fine.
[5554.27s -> 5557.70s]  Why are we going all the way over here?
[5557.70s -> 5560.02s]  So what do you think of Brighton?
[5560.02s -> 5563.63s]  You're blind.
[5563.63s -> 5565.47s]  Is that what this place is called?
[5565.47s -> 5572.54s]  They say the brave who come here shall learn themselves the deepest truth.
[5572.54s -> 5575.90s]  Well, one thing I've learned is to mistrust your vacation ideas.
[5579.01s -> 5585.15s]  We traveled a year out here.
[5585.15s -> 5587.79s]  They didn't have the budget for me in this side story.
[5587.79s -> 5588.19s]  Yeah.
[5588.19s -> 5589.55s]  How come you're not here?
[5589.55s -> 5591.07s]  I'm just carrying the bags.
[5591.87s -> 5592.59s]  What are we doing?
[5596.56s -> 5599.04s]  I'm trying to stay upbeat about this, but.
[5600.98s -> 5601.86s]  The day dies.
[5601.86s -> 5602.90s]  Sun falls away.
[5602.90s -> 5604.74s]  And in the night, they build a fire.
[5604.74s -> 5606.02s]  Why do we even?
[5606.02s -> 5606.74s]  Why do we do this?
[5608.08s -> 5608.80s]  Just keep going.
[5608.80s -> 5609.92s]  There must be a reason.
[5609.92s -> 5612.88s]  I don't know what I expected to find.
[5612.88s -> 5615.28s]  I think I'm mostly looking for a feeling.
[5616.08s -> 5623.50s]  Is that really something you can search for?
[5623.50s -> 5625.82s]  Remember when we did this?
[5625.82s -> 5627.02s]  Everything was new.
[5627.02s -> 5630.14s]  Each path we took and every labor we put ourselves to.
[5631.36s -> 5632.16s]  I'm bored.
[5632.96s -> 5637.70s]  You know, it's really boring walking for a year and.
[5637.70s -> 5640.34s]  To find to build a fire in the woods.
[5640.34s -> 5642.18s]  And not fighting anything, not doing any adventures.
[5642.18s -> 5646.02s]  We just we just go like on a walk across the whole country.
[5646.02s -> 5648.74s]  You know, what's even more boring than that is doing the same thing.
[5648.74s -> 5650.50s]  But neither of you spoke to me for a year.
[5650.50s -> 5653.71s]  I just yeah, we didn't even ask.
[5654.99s -> 5655.71s]  You just came.
[5658.29s -> 5660.93s]  Tell me of sorrow this rose that you kept.
[5660.93s -> 5664.13s]  By the bed in which last your pole is about slapped.
[5664.13s -> 5665.65s]  Why am I singing this?
[5665.65s -> 5666.53s]  That's a theater kid.
[5670.22s -> 5670.94s]  That song.
[5673.60s -> 5676.88s]  She woke full of laughter and brightly she gazed
[5676.88s -> 5679.68s]  at the curve of her mouth and a kiss she appraised.
[5684.66s -> 5685.86s]  All right, I'm going to count you guys in.
[5685.86s -> 5688.90s]  Okay, three, two, one, go.
[5688.90s -> 5690.82s]  She sang over the hills.
[5692.18s -> 5694.42s]  It instantly voice jammered me.
[5696.42s -> 5697.54s]  Take your headphones out.
[5697.54s -> 5698.10s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5698.98s -> 5700.66s]  Sir, sir, take out your headphones.
[5700.66s -> 5701.14s]  Okay.
[5701.14s -> 5702.10s]  Ready?
[5702.10s -> 5703.62s]  Three, two, one.
[5704.34s -> 5706.10s]  She sang over the hills.
[5706.10s -> 5707.78s]  Peaks are shy, but sure dawn.
[5709.38s -> 5713.14s]  And sure as the sunrise I'll someday be gone.
[5713.14s -> 5714.74s]  But recall me my love.
[5715.54s -> 5717.54s]  And our joy may live on.
[5718.50s -> 5723.78s]  And you do and you do and you do you.
[5723.78s -> 5724.58s]  That's a howl at the end.
[5724.58s -> 5725.38s]  There has to be a howl at the end.
[5726.18s -> 5731.70s]  And then we fused as one.
[5731.70s -> 5738.37s]  The old love song is one he's sung a hundred times by a fire,
[5738.37s -> 5740.13s]  a hundred times with a friend.
[5740.13s -> 5742.78s]  And still tonight it feels new.
[5743.82s -> 5750.96s]  Strange song always broke my heart when we sing it together.
[5750.96s -> 5753.38s]  Forming a deeper bond of love.
[5753.38s -> 5754.90s]  I we might be.
[5754.90s -> 5756.82s]  I suppose we each thought of each other
[5756.82s -> 5760.11s]  and what it would be like to have to go on alone.
[5760.11s -> 5762.99s]  Is the relationship more akin to like a human and a pet dog?
[5762.99s -> 5763.63s]  Or is it like?
[5764.27s -> 5764.75s]  I don't know.
[5764.75s -> 5765.23s]  We'll find out.
[5766.93s -> 5768.93s]  A noise rises in the darkness.
[5768.93s -> 5770.37s]  Not an echo of them,
[5770.37s -> 5773.17s]  but the resonant call of something else.
[5775.42s -> 5777.90s]  Did our voices awake the neighbors?
[5778.78s -> 5782.46s]  Well, there's been some run ins out here.
[5782.46s -> 5783.18s]  Stick by the fire.
[5783.18s -> 5784.22s]  Maybe it's nothing.
[5784.22s -> 5786.11s]  If we're being hunted,
[5786.11s -> 5789.47s]  I say we turn the snares on our enemy.
[5789.47s -> 5795.41s]  Okay. Well, so my choice here is to let you guys stay by the fire
[5795.41s -> 5797.17s]  with the guy with the fire wand.
[5798.77s -> 5799.97s]  Ooh, that's a sure bet.
[5800.61s -> 5804.61s]  Or roll the dice on a Lugas hunting prey.
[5804.61s -> 5806.93s]  I'm going to stay by the fire for you guys.
[5808.22s -> 5813.82s]  Oh, I want to sing and I want to kill and I want to fuck.
[5813.82s -> 5816.86s]  They stand back to back at the rim of the fire light.
[5816.86s -> 5817.82s]  A foe emerges.
[5820.99s -> 5821.39s]  Oh shit.
[5821.39s -> 5822.91s]  These look scary.
[5822.91s -> 5823.79s]  Like, yeah.
[5823.79s -> 5825.39s]  They're like necrobots.
[5825.39s -> 5827.31s]  Yeah, they're like necrobots.
[5827.31s -> 5829.23s]  So wait, you have you're here.
[5830.46s -> 5833.10s]  So I think these side stories normally involve two characters,
[5833.10s -> 5834.62s]  but the whole pie comes along.
[5834.62s -> 5842.30s]  Oh, and early on he said he loved you.
[5842.30s -> 5843.58s]  So you would have been like the guy.
[5844.22s -> 5844.54s]  All right.
[5844.54s -> 5845.34s]  I'm fusing this.
[5845.98s -> 5846.62s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[5846.62s -> 5848.86s]  I think they're going to actually one over there.
[5848.86s -> 5850.22s]  I think they all gather over there.
[5850.78s -> 5852.14s]  It is this one on each side.
[5852.14s -> 5860.24s]  Okay, I'm going to I'm going to just pin this person over here
[5860.24s -> 5861.50s]  so they don't move.
[5862.14s -> 5866.29s]  You guys can deal with that.
[5869.15s -> 5870.42s]  Demolished.
[5870.42s -> 5870.90s]  Good work.
[5873.34s -> 5874.62s]  I'll get in front of you.
[5874.62s -> 5876.72s]  I can just hurt it.
[5876.72s -> 5879.07s]  Nice.
[5879.07s -> 5887.87s]  Somebody still have an action?
[5888.43s -> 5889.47s]  Yeah, hold on.
[5889.47s -> 5891.47s]  No, it won't let me.
[5891.47s -> 5899.18s]  Let me see.
[5899.18s -> 5901.26s]  I'm waiting for the walls of your room to fall down,
[5901.26s -> 5906.38s]  revealing you're in front of a live studio audience.
[5906.38s -> 5907.02s]  Nice work.
[5907.02s -> 5909.41s]  Oh, my level.
[5909.41s -> 5909.91s]  Yeah.
[5913.39s -> 5914.11s]  Piercing shots.
[5914.11s -> 5915.79s]  My range attacks have to pierce.
[5915.79s -> 5917.78s]  Does that mean it goes through, buddies?
[5918.78s -> 5919.98s]  Passive a bard.
[5919.98s -> 5922.94s]  A lungus reduces the cost of recruit job.
[5922.94s -> 5924.94s]  We've never done that ever.
[5924.94s -> 5925.82s]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[5926.94s -> 5927.98s]  One speed.
[5927.98s -> 5928.78s]  You can upgrade howl.
[5929.58s -> 5934.34s]  Howl.
[5934.34s -> 5934.84s]  I'm a wolf.
[5937.36s -> 5938.32s]  Look at that.
[5938.32s -> 5939.20s]  Warrior's armor.
[5941.31s -> 5942.59s]  Yeah, I'll link mail.
[5942.59s -> 5946.83s]  That looks pretty sick.
[5946.83s -> 5948.11s]  It's not even my adventure.
[5948.11s -> 5949.15s]  I'll take the loot.
[5951.33s -> 5953.86s]  To my eyes, it's all clear.
[5953.86s -> 5956.48s]  Same here, nothing moving.
[5956.48s -> 5957.92s]  Well, that was sudden.
[5963.46s -> 5967.70s]  Seems like we'll survive another night.
[5967.70s -> 5970.10s]  You know, I'm glad we came out.
[5972.54s -> 5975.52s]  But let us be on the road at dawn.
[5975.52s -> 5978.72s]  Yeah.
[5978.72s -> 5982.29s]  When you sang and when I sang with you,
[5983.92s -> 5988.26s]  I considered that word I tend to think of all the time.
[5988.26s -> 5989.98s]  It's raising.
[5989.98s -> 5990.94s]  It's like a well.
[5993.15s -> 5995.95s]  This well inside you will always fill and empty.
[5995.95s -> 5996.51s]  It's fine.
[5996.51s -> 6003.07s]  But I want to live for the lasting things like love and old well-worn songs.
[6006.51s -> 6008.99s]  In the morning, they will simply start home.
[6009.71s -> 6011.63s]  So if we walk all the way back, I will lose it.
[6012.59s -> 6015.31s]  Just for clarity's sake, we could have done this.
[6016.90s -> 6018.42s]  Anywhere, like a year ago.
[6018.42s -> 6019.22s]  We could have just walked in.
[6019.22s -> 6023.79s]  Yeah, but along us convinced us to walk for a year to the birthplace.
[6023.79s -> 6027.55s]  Oh, he leveled up from doing his side quests.
[6027.55s -> 6031.23s]  He's going to live 10 extra years and he now gets another move.
[6031.23s -> 6032.99s]  I'm a blue-born hunter now.
[6032.99s -> 6036.00s]  I can throw a trap.
[6038.19s -> 6041.66s]  Every time I kill an enemy, I can enter the gray plane.
[6041.66s -> 6044.14s]  That's stealth.
[6044.14s -> 6045.26s]  30 dodge.
[6045.26s -> 6047.63s]  30 dodge sounds like a lot.
[6047.63s -> 6050.94s]  It does.
[6050.94s -> 6052.70s]  Yeah, and you already have the plus dodge stuff.
[6052.70s -> 6054.70s]  Oh, and you can reroll these with lupi.
[6055.26s -> 6055.74s]  Yeah.
[6055.74s -> 6058.37s]  I feel like I'm not supposed to waste that.
[6058.37s -> 6059.73s]  How much LP do we all have?
[6059.73s -> 6063.47s]  It says at the eight at the top, right?
[6063.47s -> 6065.52s]  So we share this as a group.
[6065.52s -> 6065.84s]  Yeah.
[6065.84s -> 6066.32s]  Okay.
[6066.32s -> 6071.94s]  Did anything reroll?
[6072.74s -> 6074.66s]  It gave me the same dodge again.
[6074.66s -> 6075.38s]  Oh, okay.
[6075.38s -> 6076.82s]  For a second, I thought nothing changed.
[6076.82s -> 6077.94s]  And wind walk.
[6077.94s -> 6083.10s]  Wind walk is like Misty Step.
[6083.10s -> 6085.94s]  Like you'll be able to teleport somewhere, I think.
[6087.36s -> 6088.16s]  Thornbanging.
[6088.90s -> 6089.40s]  Okay.
[6089.78s -> 6091.97s]  Because that bite was doing a lot of damage.
[6091.97s -> 6095.89s]  I think we can go to the Hallenwalds from here and just walk.
[6095.89s -> 6097.41s]  It's only 20 days.
[6097.41s -> 6099.33s]  Wait, weren't we at the Hallenwalds, though?
[6101.10s -> 6102.70s]  No, this is fine.
[6103.42s -> 6107.20s]  Okay.
[6107.20s -> 6112.00s]  Wow, we really did lose six months and 33 days on that journey.
[6112.80s -> 6116.16s]  I can't believe we walked from just here all the way to here.
[6116.16s -> 6117.52s]  I would like to apologize.
[6118.16s -> 6119.28s]  Or us to sing a song.
[6122.26s -> 6124.66s]  Okay, Hallenwalds has been revealed.
[6127.31s -> 6128.99s]  See, this is a big world.
[6129.71s -> 6130.03s]  Wait.
[6130.75s -> 6132.03s]  Okay, so we can't actually...
[6132.03s -> 6133.23s]  This is the last place.
[6133.23s -> 6135.47s]  It says assault the Lithgram engine.
[6135.47s -> 6137.31s]  We must achieve our other objectives first.
[6137.31s -> 6139.71s]  So we must clear all the hostiles in the land.
[6139.71s -> 6141.71s]  So we have to go to the other three places.
[6143.90s -> 6144.94s]  Everywhere is in part...
[6144.94s -> 6145.66s]  Oh, no.
[6145.66s -> 6149.18s]  Oh, the only place we haven't been is Humble Demon Beaches,
[6149.18s -> 6149.98s]  which is all...
[6149.98s -> 6151.18s]  It's going to be a year.
[6151.18s -> 6152.06s]  It's going to be so far.
[6153.66s -> 6159.79s]  Let's patrol this place and get rid of the thorns,
[6159.79s -> 6161.39s]  and then we will leave.
[6161.39s -> 6163.79s]  Well, at least you leveled up a couple of times.
[6163.79s -> 6166.03s]  I tricked my party into taking me on a walk.
[6166.59s -> 6167.36s]  Okay.
[6167.36s -> 6168.56s]  A very long walk.
[6168.56s -> 6170.08s]  How far is this trip?
[6170.08s -> 6173.49s]  Okay, are we carving a pass all the way there?
[6173.49s -> 6176.05s]  It's a commitment, but I think it'll bring us goodwill.
[6176.05s -> 6178.37s]  Goodwill can buy you a lot in times of need.
[6178.37s -> 6181.86s]  Okay, I guess let's get started
[6181.86s -> 6184.74s]  and try and carve our way to the place we haven't been.
[6184.74s -> 6185.54s]  Let's get started.
[6186.50s -> 6188.82s]  Okay, 78 days it will take.
[6188.82s -> 6190.02s]  Oh, my God.
[6190.02s -> 6191.38s]  Oh, my goodness.
[6191.38s -> 6192.58s]  We have to walk all the way.
[6193.38s -> 6198.26s]  We lost nearly two years from your inspiration journey.
[6198.26s -> 6198.90s]  I love this.
[6199.46s -> 6201.94s]  We spent more time finding inspiration for you
[6201.94s -> 6203.46s]  than we have on the rest of our quest.
[6204.10s -> 6205.50s]  Thank you.
[6205.50s -> 6206.14s]  You're good friends.
[6207.10s -> 6208.06s]  Oh, God.
[6208.06s -> 6209.18s]  Oh, no.
[6209.18s -> 6210.46s]  Okay, so this is our first incursion.
[6210.46s -> 6212.78s]  So Gorgons and Greatnumber move to attack our lands.
[6212.78s -> 6214.30s]  Your enemies will travel from tile to tile,
[6214.30s -> 6216.06s]  attacking and destroying all the sites.
[6216.14s -> 6217.42s]  And so they are repelled.
[6217.42s -> 6218.78s]  Okay, so what's going to happen is
[6219.42s -> 6221.42s]  you can see their progress here.
[6221.42s -> 6222.86s]  They're going to come from that land
[6222.86s -> 6225.34s]  through Arnie Vigil and then Thunderost.
[6226.30s -> 6229.98s]  So should we just set up shop in Arnie Village?
[6229.98s -> 6231.10s]  Yeah, that's the best.
[6231.10s -> 6233.18s]  Probably the best idea is to set up shop in Arnie
[6233.18s -> 6234.78s]  and then intercept them.
[6234.78s -> 6236.22s]  Or we can just keep building this bridge
[6236.22s -> 6237.42s]  and then like follow them.
[6238.90s -> 6239.46s]  Wrap around.
[6240.88s -> 6241.92s]  I'm down for whatever.
[6241.92s -> 6243.84s]  Yeah, I think we can intercept them, right?
[6243.84s -> 6246.18s]  That's probably safe.
[6246.18s -> 6250.30s]  Yeah, that's secure.
[6251.28s -> 6254.51s]  Okay, do you want to find an item while we're securing?
[6254.51s -> 6256.43s]  I think we should work faster
[6256.43s -> 6258.67s]  with the whole incursion situation.
[6258.67s -> 6259.31s]  Yeah, okay.
[6259.31s -> 6260.19s]  Okay, that's good.
[6260.19s -> 6265.36s]  Yeah, let's just take everyone off of this.
[6265.36s -> 6266.69s]  Yeah.
[6266.69s -> 6267.89s]  And go.
[6267.89s -> 6270.77s]  Yeah, because they might just be on their way over here now.
[6271.33s -> 6273.09s]  Yeah, see how it's filling up with...
[6273.09s -> 6274.61s]  Okay, do we want to cancel all these?
[6274.61s -> 6276.53s]  No, I think we can handle these.
[6276.53s -> 6277.78s]  I think we're all right.
[6277.78s -> 6280.21s]  We don't want to waste all of our points.
[6280.21s -> 6281.33s]  Yeah, we're strong.
[6281.33s -> 6282.18s]  Oh, no.
[6283.81s -> 6284.85s]  Whatever this is, what's this?
[6284.85s -> 6285.33s]  Gorgons?
[6285.33s -> 6287.34s]  Gorgons is terrifying.
[6287.34s -> 6287.82s]  Yeah.
[6287.82s -> 6288.78s]  Oh, my God.
[6288.78s -> 6289.58s]  What counter is this?
[6289.58s -> 6291.02s]  Oh, it's a raging Gorgon.
[6291.02s -> 6292.38s]  Okay, okay.
[6292.38s -> 6294.10s]  So we're dead.
[6294.10s -> 6294.50s]  Everything's...
[6294.50s -> 6295.46s]  No, everything's fine.
[6295.46s -> 6295.94s]  We've got this.
[6295.94s -> 6297.30s]  We're going to crush this.
[6297.30s -> 6301.18s]  We've been killing everything.
[6301.18s -> 6305.26s]  Arnyvigil has been cleaned and put in good order,
[6305.26s -> 6307.98s]  with time left for a few days of comfort.
[6307.98s -> 6310.30s]  Arnyvigil will return to the hands of the common folk
[6310.30s -> 6311.34s]  while they tend it.
[6311.34s -> 6316.11s]  The site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.
[6316.11s -> 6317.71s]  Tides, ingots, spell threads.
[6317.71s -> 6318.11s]  Good.
[6318.11s -> 6320.93s]  They were carved in the past.
[6324.53s -> 6324.93s]  I think it's...
[6325.73s -> 6327.49s]  You know what I mean?
[6327.57s -> 6328.29s]  Yeah, I don't know how...
[6331.97s -> 6334.91s]  Are we building a bridge so the enemy can use that bridge?
[6334.91s -> 6336.03s]  We're not doing that, are we?
[6336.91s -> 6337.71s]  Yeah, I think we are.
[6339.31s -> 6340.59s]  Why are we helping them?
[6340.59s -> 6341.07s]  It's fine.
[6342.51s -> 6343.47s]  What else are we going to do, I guess?
[6343.47s -> 6344.99s]  They can't get over here.
[6344.99s -> 6347.44s]  We're helping them get over here.
[6347.44s -> 6348.08s]  Well, they're...
[6348.08s -> 6348.80s]  Yeah, they're beasts.
[6348.80s -> 6349.60s]  Maybe they'll swim.
[6349.60s -> 6350.32s]  We don't know.
[6350.32s -> 6352.06s]  Okay.
[6352.06s -> 6353.50s]  So now we have to stop what we're doing.
[6357.02s -> 6359.02s]  All heroes on this tile will fight.
[6359.42s -> 6361.58s]  It looks like we have four farmers helping us.
[6361.58s -> 6362.30s]  What?
[6362.30s -> 6365.82s]  The Gorgons have come.
[6366.46s -> 6369.74s]  Silence falls, emerging in their tortured shapes.
[6369.74s -> 6373.66s]  The beasts only breathe and blink their oozing eyes.
[6375.76s -> 6377.76s]  How should the defenders respond?
[6379.04s -> 6379.92s]  Along us, I...
[6380.72s -> 6383.04s]  Okay.
[6383.04s -> 6384.40s]  Charge into battle and fight them.
[6384.40s -> 6386.56s]  Use our knowledge of the land and harry their approach
[6386.56s -> 6388.96s]  or stay here until the last moment and fight with cunning.
[6390.72s -> 6392.48s]  I mean, my vote's going to be on that.
[6392.48s -> 6393.04s]  I'd...
[6393.04s -> 6395.04s]  We'll just jump out and surprise them
[6395.04s -> 6396.96s]  and then we'll get the jump on them.
[6396.96s -> 6399.38s]  Use any excuse to play hide and seek.
[6399.38s -> 6401.54s]  Yeah, he loves hide and seek, dude.
[6401.54s -> 6402.77s]  Is it?
[6402.77s -> 6404.45s]  Concealed amid their surroundings,
[6404.45s -> 6406.85s]  they elude the frustrated eyes of their enemy.
[6406.85s -> 6410.94s]  Choosing the moment to strike is up to them.
[6410.94s -> 6411.82s]  Wait for it.
[6411.82s -> 6419.70s]  Okay, we all begin in stealth and we have flanking attacks.
[6419.70s -> 6422.13s]  Nice.
[6422.13s -> 6424.29s]  Oh my god.
[6424.29s -> 6426.13s]  There are so many enemies.
[6426.13s -> 6432.78s]  So I think we are actually going to be controlling the farmers too, I think.
[6435.71s -> 6436.99s]  There's one up there.
[6437.07s -> 6439.70s]  Are there any in this room or no?
[6439.70s -> 6440.34s]  No, no, no.
[6440.34s -> 6440.74s]  We...
[6440.74s -> 6443.97s]  I think they were going to be coming from the top of the screen.
[6443.97s -> 6444.53s]  Oh, no, they're not.
[6444.53s -> 6445.73s]  There's some below us too.
[6445.73s -> 6446.21s]  Oh, shit.
[6446.21s -> 6446.53s]  Where?
[6446.53s -> 6447.49s]  Oh, yeah, they're out down there.
[6447.49s -> 6447.81s]  All right.
[6447.81s -> 6448.69s]  I'm gonna...
[6448.69s -> 6451.82s]  I'm gonna make my way over there.
[6451.82s -> 6452.46s]  Oh, god.
[6452.46s -> 6453.02s]  Okay.
[6453.02s -> 6454.21s]  There's a huge guy over here.
[6454.21s -> 6455.57s]  Oh, there's a lot...
[6455.57s -> 6456.69s]  Oh, wait, where?
[6456.69s -> 6457.41s]  On the right.
[6457.41s -> 6459.23s]  Is he down by me?
[6459.23s -> 6460.19s]  Oh, yeah, I see him.
[6460.19s -> 6462.59s]  You want me to move to intercept?
[6462.59s -> 6465.23s]  We should probably prioritize this guy
[6465.23s -> 6466.75s]  because I think there's enough...
[6466.75s -> 6468.32s]  We have barricades, right?
[6468.64s -> 6472.45s]  Sacrifice as many villagers as you can.
[6472.45s -> 6476.27s]  Wait, are you throwing the villages at the...
[6476.27s -> 6477.15s]  Oh, fuck!
[6477.15s -> 6478.27s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[6478.27s -> 6478.91s]  Oh, okay.
[6478.91s -> 6479.15s]  Yeah.
[6479.95s -> 6481.07s]  I thought I was...
[6481.07s -> 6481.71s]  All right, all right.
[6481.71s -> 6482.69s]  We're okay.
[6482.69s -> 6483.17s]  We're okay.
[6483.17s -> 6487.07s]  I didn't realize I had all control of these people.
[6487.07s -> 6489.07s]  We just can send them anywhere, really.
[6489.07s -> 6493.87s]  We have control.
[6493.87s -> 6495.71s]  Yeah, use them to block the barricades.
[6495.71s -> 6496.19s]  Just have...
[6496.19s -> 6496.83s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6496.83s -> 6497.23s]  Just have...
[6497.23s -> 6498.27s]  File the bodies.
[6498.27s -> 6499.07s]  Oh, no.
[6499.07s -> 6499.79s]  Oh, my god.
[6501.55s -> 6502.19s]  Wait, what?
[6502.19s -> 6502.91s]  They just jumped over?
[6502.91s -> 6503.63s]  I intercepted him.
[6504.19s -> 6504.43s]  Nice.
[6505.15s -> 6509.28s]  Uh-oh.
[6509.28s -> 6509.52s]  Okay.
[6510.78s -> 6511.90s]  They come from inside the houses.
[6511.90s -> 6513.34s]  Oh, my god.
[6513.34s -> 6514.30s]  There's so many.
[6515.82s -> 6517.98s]  Uh, okay.
[6519.54s -> 6519.78s]  I...
[6520.58s -> 6523.63s]  I'm going to infuse the cart.
[6523.63s -> 6527.92s]  I'm going to try to do some damage over here.
[6527.92s -> 6529.28s]  I'm going to double infuse it.
[6529.84s -> 6530.56s]  No, I'm not.
[6530.56s -> 6533.34s]  See if I can hurt these guys over here.
[6533.34s -> 6537.66s]  Shit, it's not far enough.
[6537.66s -> 6544.19s]  Oh, there we go.
[6544.19s -> 6545.79s]  That didn't hurt that much.
[6545.79s -> 6550.16s]  Wait, which one did you hit?
[6550.16s -> 6551.04s]  Oh, back over there.
[6551.04s -> 6553.36s]  I'm going to move, except the big guy, I think.
[6553.36s -> 6557.17s]  Okay.
[6560.96s -> 6562.64s]  Uh, blocked.
[6562.64s -> 6562.96s]  Uh-oh.
[6563.76s -> 6564.88s]  He's going to eat you.
[6564.88s -> 6567.84s]  Bring this guy down here.
[6568.72s -> 6571.26s]  Yeah.
[6571.26s -> 6571.66s]  Good shot.
[6571.66s -> 6572.06s]  Good shot.
[6575.89s -> 6576.37s]  Oh, no.
[6577.49s -> 6578.37s]  No, kidding.
[6578.37s -> 6579.17s]  He's going to die.
[6580.64s -> 6582.16s]  There are a lot of people down here.
[6582.16s -> 6583.44s]  There's four enemies down here.
[6583.44s -> 6584.56s]  How many are up top?
[6584.56s -> 6585.52s]  There's two?
[6585.52s -> 6585.76s]  One?
[6586.32s -> 6587.33s]  There's one left.
[6588.21s -> 6589.25s]  Thomas got grabbed.
[6589.25s -> 6591.60s]  Oh, what do I do?
[6591.60s -> 6594.14s]  Can you run or are you rooted?
[6594.14s -> 6594.54s]  I don't think...
[6594.54s -> 6595.02s]  Am I not?
[6595.02s -> 6595.50s]  I don't know.
[6595.50s -> 6595.98s]  I don't...
[6595.98s -> 6596.62s]  I can't get over there.
[6599.60s -> 6601.49s]  Can I go in the door?
[6601.49s -> 6602.13s]  Can you...
[6602.13s -> 6602.93s]  Yeah.
[6602.93s -> 6604.69s]  Open the door and then run through.
[6604.69s -> 6604.93s]  All right.
[6604.93s -> 6606.94s]  I'm out of here.
[6606.94s -> 6608.06s]  I'm not fucking with that.
[6608.06s -> 6609.26s]  Oh, zoinks.
[6609.26s -> 6611.60s]  Yeah.
[6611.60s -> 6614.40s]  You guys do have like a Shaggy and Scooby vibe going on.
[6614.40s -> 6621.01s]  Shit.
[6621.01s -> 6622.05s]  Why did I shoot?
[6622.05s -> 6622.61s]  Oh, my God.
[6622.61s -> 6623.57s]  I'm an idiot.
[6623.57s -> 6630.35s]  Here we go.
[6630.35s -> 6630.67s]  All right.
[6630.67s -> 6632.03s]  I feel a little bit safer.
[6632.03s -> 6633.23s]  Okay.
[6633.23s -> 6636.98s]  Hard to tell who hasn't done things.
[6636.98s -> 6637.46s]  That's right.
[6637.46s -> 6638.10s]  It would just...
[6638.10s -> 6639.14s]  If someone hasn't acted,
[6639.14s -> 6641.54s]  it would just jump to them once you've like had the turn.
[6641.54s -> 6642.10s]  I think it's...
[6642.10s -> 6643.86s]  Their portrait is not...
[6644.82s -> 6645.78s]  It's just kind of lit up.
[6645.78s -> 6646.10s]  Yeah.
[6646.10s -> 6652.86s]  Let's get Katie to safety.
[6652.86s -> 6653.26s]  Is that right?
[6653.98s -> 6654.46s]  Oh, no.
[6654.46s -> 6654.86s]  Uh-oh.
[6657.23s -> 6658.03s]  Lost Staya.
[6658.03s -> 6659.07s]  Don't think we're...
[6659.07s -> 6659.87s]  Oh, no.
[6659.87s -> 6660.43s]  That's bad.
[6663.15s -> 6663.31s]  Okay.
[6663.31s -> 6667.20s]  Can you throw that whole barricade at them or something?
[6667.20s -> 6668.88s]  I can't select the barricade.
[6668.88s -> 6669.60s]  Let me see if I can just...
[6669.60s -> 6670.88s]  Let me walk back over here.
[6670.88s -> 6673.74s]  Okay.
[6673.74s -> 6674.22s]  I can...
[6674.22s -> 6674.62s]  All right.
[6674.62s -> 6675.10s]  I can...
[6675.74s -> 6679.97s]  I'm going to try to throw the barricade like you said.
[6679.97s -> 6680.29s]  All right.
[6680.85s -> 6681.09s]  Uh...
[6682.21s -> 6682.69s]  Blast.
[6683.49s -> 6685.74s]  What does this do?
[6685.74s -> 6687.89s]  All right.
[6687.89s -> 6688.37s]  I can do this.
[6688.37s -> 6689.33s]  This is going to hurt a lot.
[6689.33s -> 6694.45s]  Oh, nice.
[6694.45s -> 6695.73s]  Although I did get rid of the barricade.
[6695.73s -> 6696.53s]  I feel like that's bad.
[6698.35s -> 6699.87s]  Don't know if that's a good idea or not.
[6699.87s -> 6701.55s]  We turned our defense into offense.
[6701.55s -> 6701.87s]  Oh, my God.
[6701.87s -> 6703.15s]  There's a giant furnace.
[6703.23s -> 6706.59s]  I'm going to put her in front of you so you don't die.
[6706.59s -> 6708.51s]  Yeah, I need to move towards this fire
[6708.51s -> 6711.89s]  because I want to pull up next turn.
[6711.89s -> 6712.13s]  Wait.
[6714.66s -> 6714.90s]  Nice.
[6715.70s -> 6718.86s]  Oh, he was untouchable because I killed him.
[6718.86s -> 6723.86s]  Cool.
[6723.86s -> 6724.34s]  Uh-oh.
[6724.34s -> 6724.98s]  My blindness.
[6725.62s -> 6726.66s]  I can't select this.
[6726.66s -> 6727.14s]  Shit.
[6727.14s -> 6727.46s]  Sorry.
[6732.78s -> 6733.10s]  Ooh.
[6740.06s -> 6743.02s]  I love how the mage just kind of breaks objects in the world
[6743.02s -> 6743.90s]  and throws it at people.
[6751.81s -> 6752.69s]  Actually, that was...
[6752.69s -> 6753.49s]  We did a pretty good job.
[6754.37s -> 6755.25s]  Yeah, that was really good.
[6756.77s -> 6757.25s]  Thomas.
[6758.46s -> 6759.42s]  Level up.
[6759.42s -> 6761.74s]  Thomas has grown stronger.
[6763.55s -> 6763.87s]  OK.
[6764.59s -> 6767.36s]  I like this one.
[6768.00s -> 6774.93s]  Naturalist compulsion.
[6776.85s -> 6777.25s]  Oh, yeah.
[6777.25s -> 6778.05s]  You can move an enemy.
[6779.86s -> 6780.34s]  I like that.
[6781.06s -> 6782.34s]  I think that's very useful.
[6782.90s -> 6784.34s]  Cool.
[6784.34s -> 6784.66s]  All right.
[6784.66s -> 6786.66s]  So we quelled the invasion.
[6788.42s -> 6789.94s]  Now we're just going to finish building the bridge.
[6789.94s -> 6791.14s]  Let's finish building that bridge.
[6796.98s -> 6797.30s]  Yep.
[6798.18s -> 6799.86s]  I can't believe that's what we actually were doing.
[6801.82s -> 6803.02s]  Build the bridge for the enemy.
[6803.02s -> 6803.26s]  Yeah.
[6809.54s -> 6810.82s]  Year five.
[6810.82s -> 6812.46s]  OK.
[6812.46s -> 6813.26s]  So that's a...
[6813.26s -> 6815.50s]  It's a strength full or we can patrol and get it down.
[6815.50s -> 6817.74s]  I feel like we could maybe handle a strength full though.
[6817.74s -> 6818.62s]  I think so.
[6818.62s -> 6821.09s]  I think we're gods among men.
[6821.09s -> 6822.77s]  We're in year five at this point
[6822.77s -> 6825.57s]  because Alongus took us on a two-year round trip.
[6825.57s -> 6827.34s]  Sorry.
[6827.34s -> 6828.38s]  We learned a lot.
[6828.38s -> 6828.94s]  We...
[6828.94s -> 6829.50s]  Yeah, we did.
[6830.14s -> 6831.26s]  Got some stuff.
[6831.26s -> 6834.18s]  All right.
[6834.18s -> 6835.70s]  You finally get to be in the game.
[6835.70s -> 6837.49s]  So that's good.
[6837.49s -> 6837.65s]  Yeah.
[6837.65s -> 6837.89s]  Look.
[6837.89s -> 6840.70s]  I'm there.
[6840.70s -> 6843.34s]  Uh, you want me to keep going?
[6843.34s -> 6844.35s]  You were...
[6844.35s -> 6844.83s]  I was...
[6844.83s -> 6845.92s]  I'm chewing.
[6845.92s -> 6848.96s]  A ridge of limestone wraps the edge of Ghost Ring.
[6848.96s -> 6854.03s]  Find a way from this direction and you'd have the high ground.
[6854.03s -> 6855.07s]  You'd have surprise.
[6855.07s -> 6858.75s]  I don't know.
[6858.75s -> 6863.42s]  Looks impossible.
[6863.42s -> 6864.54s]  Possibly.
[6864.54s -> 6871.42s]  But limestone is a rock full of surprises.
[6871.42s -> 6876.29s]  After a few dead ends and false hopes.
[6876.29s -> 6877.87s]  I like that little snake.
[6877.87s -> 6882.91s]  Finally, a promising channel in the stone stretches out in the right direction.
[6882.91s -> 6886.83s]  Probably carved by an ancient stream.
[6886.83s -> 6892.59s]  See, limestone is a note worthy that when repeatedly exposed to water.
[6892.59s -> 6894.94s]  What?
[6894.94s -> 6897.12s]  Seems sturdy enough.
[6897.12s -> 6898.32s]  I think you just got trapped.
[6898.32s -> 6902.24s]  You got lost in a thought there and we just kind of just didn't even think to interject.
[6902.24s -> 6904.48s]  Yeah, his wolfy ramblings.
[6904.48s -> 6906.53s]  You doing okay back there?
[6906.53s -> 6913.92s]  It's kind of tight here, isn't it?
[6913.92s -> 6916.24s]  Not all of us are made of wet noodles and silk.
[6916.24s -> 6916.96s]  Some of us got...
[6918.00s -> 6921.39s]  Warrior shoulders.
[6921.39s -> 6925.81s]  Hey, perfect.
[6925.81s -> 6927.09s]  Here we are.
[6927.09s -> 6929.57s]  Couldn't ask for a better spot to emerge.
[6929.57s -> 6933.68s]  Just one last squeeze and it's a straight shot to Ghost Ring.
[6933.68s -> 6939.20s]  I mean, I could ask for a slightly better spot to emerge.
[6940.99s -> 6942.75s]  Maybe one that was a little bigger.
[6949.01s -> 6950.53s]  You're so hard for you to maneuver.
[6959.41s -> 6960.21s]  Should we pull him?
[6960.21s -> 6962.85s]  Should we grab him and pull him through?
[6962.85s -> 6963.81s]  You got this.
[6963.81s -> 6964.85s]  You're a panther.
[6965.49s -> 6966.29s]  You're...
[6966.29s -> 6970.42s]  If anyone asks, tell them I went down honorably.
[6970.42s -> 6975.68s]  You're not gonna die here, are you?
[6975.68s -> 6982.11s]  I have a 43% chance to push through or I'm literally gonna go around.
[6982.11s -> 6982.99s]  We have to push through.
[6982.99s -> 6987.12s]  I'm too stubborn.
[6987.12s -> 6988.88s]  You sure there's nothing we can do?
[6988.88s -> 6990.90s]  Standing back might be best.
[6994.93s -> 6999.78s]  And then twists and tightens in each turn.
[6999.78s -> 7000.98s]  I hope you lose the other eye.
[7002.70s -> 7011.23s]  Was damn right for a pubic.
[7011.23s -> 7012.03s]  All right, we did it.
[7013.36s -> 7014.24s]  Kill them.
[7014.24s -> 7015.92s]  Oh, our crit chance is doubled.
[7021.01s -> 7021.73s]  All right.
[7021.73s -> 7025.41s]  Also, yes, something you guys might not be aware of is if you stand next to each other,
[7025.41s -> 7027.89s]  you get like a defensive bonus.
[7027.89s -> 7029.17s]  You'll see like a little shield up here.
[7029.17s -> 7029.97s]  Oh, that's true.
[7031.17s -> 7031.97s]  Cohesiveness?
[7035.26s -> 7035.58s]  Yeah.
[7039.25s -> 7040.53s]  And I started blasting.
[7049.63s -> 7051.07s]  Oh, scalding rain.
[7053.02s -> 7054.54s]  Oh, this is gonna be insane.
[7054.54s -> 7054.78s]  All right.
[7054.78s -> 7055.66s]  Who am I doing this to?
[7056.82s -> 7057.06s]  You.
[7061.02s -> 7061.82s]  That was a pretty cool move.
[7061.82s -> 7062.54s]  It's because it's a well.
[7063.42s -> 7065.94s]  Oh, you heat it up with the fire stuff.
[7067.46s -> 7075.22s]  Okay.
[7075.22s -> 7080.06s]  Let's do it again.
[7080.06s -> 7081.42s]  Time for my secret move.
[7082.14s -> 7087.95s]  What does that do?
[7088.51s -> 7090.42s]  This makes you be able to move fast.
[7090.42s -> 7092.18s]  It's like an RP thing.
[7093.22s -> 7095.22s]  We get plus two movement, I think, when he howls.
[7096.02s -> 7096.58s]  That's helpful.
[7099.92s -> 7106.74s]  I'm going to do this fucking bite it.
[7109.78s -> 7114.62s]  It was a pig after all.
[7114.62s -> 7117.25s]  Oh, I was just keep doing it.
[7118.30s -> 7120.83s]  Oh, he blocked water.
[7121.47s -> 7121.95s]  Bullshit.
[7122.67s -> 7127.66s]  There's a lot.
[7127.66s -> 7127.90s]  Nice.
[7128.78s -> 7130.83s]  All right.
[7136.70s -> 7139.10s]  Now, I wish my name was cool like dogwood.
[7139.10s -> 7141.18s]  A snake stone sash.
[7141.82s -> 7143.50s]  Dodge plus five dodge.
[7144.30s -> 7147.86s]  Are you going?
[7147.86s -> 7150.34s]  My dodge is criminally low because I've got my big armor.
[7150.34s -> 7153.78s]  So I think it's kind of pointless for me to have it if Thomas wants it.
[7153.78s -> 7154.26s]  I'll take it.
[7155.06s -> 7155.30s]  Yeah.
[7160.22s -> 7161.34s]  Calamity.
[7161.34s -> 7163.36s]  All right.
[7163.36s -> 7165.12s]  Now, there's hordes of raccoons.
[7167.36s -> 7171.04s]  Yeah, the Gorgons are absolutely stacked right now.
[7172.03s -> 7173.26s]  Yeah, they are.
[7173.26s -> 7173.58s]  Okay.
[7173.58s -> 7176.62s]  Do you want to secure ghost ring to find an item or should we press on?
[7177.97s -> 7178.45s]  Oh, look.
[7179.01s -> 7181.01s]  All of the achievements have been done.
[7181.01s -> 7184.61s]  We can now assault life from where we can go all the way back.
[7184.61s -> 7185.09s]  Should we go?
[7185.89s -> 7187.17s]  I'd love a walk.
[7187.17s -> 7187.57s]  I think.
[7189.65s -> 7190.85s]  Yeah, let's go for it.
[7190.85s -> 7192.61s]  Do we want to get some items before we go?
[7193.57s -> 7194.93s]  By like securing.
[7194.93s -> 7196.61s]  I mean, there's no harm in securing, right?
[7197.17s -> 7199.36s]  Yeah, it's just a little bit more time passes.
[7199.36s -> 7199.76s]  It's okay.
[7200.32s -> 7202.24s]  I'm in the mood for some scaring and discovery.
[7202.24s -> 7204.08s]  We can sit in this place right as we go, can't we?
[7205.70s -> 7205.94s]  All right.
[7205.94s -> 7207.14s]  Yeah, let's find an item.
[7207.14s -> 7212.45s]  Might as well.
[7212.45s -> 7215.25s]  32 days.
[7216.05s -> 7217.01s]  That's a long time.
[7224.03s -> 7224.99s]  Keep your heroes busy.
[7225.71s -> 7226.98s]  Oh, we're not.
[7226.98s -> 7227.38s]  Okay.
[7227.38s -> 7227.86s]  There we go.
[7228.50s -> 7229.06s]  Oh, I see.
[7234.05s -> 7234.77s]  Oh, God.
[7235.09s -> 7235.33s]  Okay.
[7236.37s -> 7237.81s]  A little scary, but that's okay.
[7237.81s -> 7238.61s]  I think we can handle it.
[7239.33s -> 7239.57s]  Yeah.
[7243.06s -> 7243.86s]  Let them come.
[7243.86s -> 7245.22s]  It's a new faction that was.
[7246.34s -> 7249.39s]  Happy birthday, everybody.
[7249.39s -> 7250.27s]  Is it whose birthday?
[7250.27s -> 7251.39s]  Is there somebody's birthday in chat?
[7251.39s -> 7252.03s]  Happy birthday.
[7252.03s -> 7252.99s]  Happy birthday.
[7252.99s -> 7253.71s]  Happy birthday.
[7256.11s -> 7260.35s]  It strikes me how much there is still to find to know I am inspired.
[7261.76s -> 7262.00s]  Wood.
[7263.28s -> 7269.20s]  We got three wood and a gloom gloss strap, which is this is crit chance.
[7269.92s -> 7270.64s]  Fine.
[7271.17s -> 7271.41s]  Thank you.
[7271.41s -> 7272.05s]  Fine.
[7272.05s -> 7272.37s]  Take it.
[7272.37s -> 7274.45s]  Oh, it is a is a wolfy thing, isn't it?
[7274.45s -> 7274.85s]  Excuse me.
[7275.81s -> 7276.77s]  We need before greed.
[7276.77s -> 7277.89s]  We need to need roll on that.
[7277.89s -> 7281.73s]  That's actually I was going to slash roll one to a hundred.
[7281.73s -> 7282.59s]  Whatever.
[7282.59s -> 7283.71s]  So we kind of messed up.
[7283.71s -> 7284.27s]  That's cool.
[7284.27s -> 7285.39s]  That's called ninja looting.
[7285.39s -> 7286.11s]  What you just did.
[7288.48s -> 7292.13s]  Well, you guys can have fun in dragon flight.
[7292.13s -> 7295.26s]  I don't have dragon flight.
[7295.26s -> 7296.78s]  Dude, I'm sorry.
[7296.78s -> 7298.30s]  I do, but I'd rather play Doctyde.
[7298.30s -> 7300.67s]  True.
[7300.67s -> 7303.79s]  None of us knew what had changed the beasts.
[7303.79s -> 7307.31s]  We could not change ourselves, so we blamed the beasts.
[7308.67s -> 7311.07s]  We knew something lived inside of them.
[7312.48s -> 7316.64s]  Blue burning hate that frenzied them, then left them still.
[7317.36s -> 7319.55s]  A stone sentence.
[7320.59s -> 7322.91s]  Worse and more deadly than any venom.
[7323.71s -> 7330.02s]  Today, we would finally find out where it came from and why it wouldn't stop.
[7330.02s -> 7330.34s]  Hold on.
[7330.34s -> 7330.98s]  Go back for a sec.
[7333.89s -> 7335.97s]  Like this is really framed.
[7335.97s -> 7338.54s]  Like you get a long shot from you.
[7338.54s -> 7338.86s]  Yeah.
[7339.50s -> 7339.74s]  Yeah.
[7340.30s -> 7342.38s]  We hired a ship photographer for our adventure.
[7346.45s -> 7350.16s]  Okay. Yeah, we can go.
[7350.16s -> 7353.60s]  Well, Lithgram Air Engine looks mostly intact.
[7353.60s -> 7358.14s]  Maybe the rumors aren't true.
[7358.14s -> 7363.87s]  It wouldn't make much sense given all we've seen.
[7368.98s -> 7372.59s]  Personally, I'm done expecting things to go smoothie.
[7372.59s -> 7373.71s]  Taps eye patch.
[7373.71s -> 7378.48s]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[7378.48s -> 7381.20s]  Why is this town named Lithgram Air Engine?
[7383.76s -> 7388.45s]  What the fuck is an air engine?
[7388.45s -> 7390.05s]  It's completely silent.
[7391.60s -> 7394.75s]  Except for this.
[7394.75s -> 7396.35s]  Oh, no, we have to explore the town.
[7396.35s -> 7397.31s]  That's literally our thing.
[7397.31s -> 7397.55s]  All right.
[7397.55s -> 7398.51s]  I'll check this house.
[7398.91s -> 7401.28s]  House looks good.
[7401.28s -> 7405.14s]  What's going on here?
[7405.14s -> 7412.50s]  I'll check the one on the right.
[7412.50s -> 7416.45s]  Anything in there?
[7416.45s -> 7417.47s]  Nothing.
[7417.47s -> 7419.12s]  Green bags.
[7419.12s -> 7419.68s]  Wait.
[7419.68s -> 7420.24s]  Oh, no.
[7420.88s -> 7421.28s]  What's wrong?
[7421.28s -> 7422.72s]  Have the villagers turned to stone?
[7422.72s -> 7423.54s]  Look.
[7423.54s -> 7429.07s]  Oh, petrified.
[7429.07s -> 7430.27s]  Beyond our help now.
[7430.27s -> 7430.51s]  Yeah.
[7440.30s -> 7441.86s]  Oh, my goodness.
[7441.86s -> 7444.16s]  As horrific as it is fascinating.
[7444.16s -> 7445.12s]  What could have done this?
[7450.93s -> 7452.43s]  There's tracks.
[7452.43s -> 7454.43s]  They go up to that barn door.
[7454.43s -> 7455.87s]  Too many buildings around.
[7455.87s -> 7456.99s]  No idea what could be waiting for us.
[7456.99s -> 7461.63s]  And whatever did this could still be inside.
[7464.69s -> 7468.51s]  Hey, they come.
[7478.74s -> 7480.66s]  Stop doing the protagonist voice.
[7480.66s -> 7481.30s]  I'm sorry.
[7485.86s -> 7486.10s]  Thanks.
[7486.10s -> 7486.98s]  I'm staying next to this fire.
[7486.98s -> 7488.26s]  I'm going to be throwing it to people.
[7488.26s -> 7489.30s]  I'm just going to wait here.
[7489.30s -> 7495.47s]  I'm going to extinguish the fire.
[7495.47s -> 7496.70s]  Don't do that.
[7496.70s -> 7497.26s]  I need.
[7497.26s -> 7502.10s]  Where are you going?
[7502.10s -> 7502.58s]  What are you thinking?
[7504.45s -> 7507.79s]  Perfect.
[7507.79s -> 7510.96s]  All right.
[7510.96s -> 7512.40s]  Who's priority?
[7512.40s -> 7513.86s]  What's priority here?
[7516.80s -> 7526.30s]  Probably the raccoons because they're ranged.
[7526.30s -> 7527.66s]  They're out of range for me here.
[7527.66s -> 7529.10s]  Wait, can I?
[7529.10s -> 7530.14s]  Wait, what did I do?
[7530.14s -> 7531.18s]  I'm going in.
[7531.18s -> 7534.02s]  Yeah, they're too far.
[7534.02s -> 7534.90s]  They're a little too far.
[7534.90s -> 7536.10s]  They need to be a little bit closer for this.
[7536.10s -> 7537.38s]  But I can do this.
[7537.38s -> 7545.31s]  I think you could walk and throw attached to the fire now.
[7545.31s -> 7546.19s]  Oh, I'm right.
[7546.19s -> 7546.75s]  I'm attached.
[7546.75s -> 7548.03s]  I forgot I could move.
[7548.03s -> 7549.87s]  For some reason, I thought I'd be still next to it.
[7549.87s -> 7550.93s]  All right, here we go.
[7550.93s -> 7553.49s]  I still can't.
[7553.49s -> 7556.45s]  Oh, maybe it's the limit.
[7556.45s -> 7557.57s]  Fire is the range.
[7558.45s -> 7567.25s]  OK, well, I'll just do this.
[7567.25s -> 7568.45s]  You eat almonds on stream.
[7569.25s -> 7570.13s]  A bunch of movement.
[7570.13s -> 7572.05s]  So I'm going to I'm just going to run over here.
[7572.61s -> 7577.09s]  All right.
[7577.09s -> 7579.87s]  Oh, everyone came to my rescue.
[7579.87s -> 7580.83s]  I want them to shoot me.
[7582.26s -> 7582.98s]  Oh, my God.
[7582.98s -> 7584.42s]  That was one hit kill.
[7584.42s -> 7586.51s]  It wasn't even your turn, right?
[7586.51s -> 7588.03s]  You just did that because it shot you.
[7588.03s -> 7589.39s]  Yeah, it was my first level up.
[7589.39s -> 7592.99s]  I guess because it shot him and we're connected that I'm able to shoot back.
[7593.55s -> 7595.78s]  I'm going to kill it.
[7595.78s -> 7596.26s]  It does.
[7596.82s -> 7598.10s]  I think I can hit this guy now.
[7600.70s -> 7601.66s]  He's just out of range.
[7601.66s -> 7601.98s]  Really?
[7608.54s -> 7609.98s]  Yeah, he's out of range still.
[7609.98s -> 7621.97s]  Let's wait till he gets closer.
[7622.61s -> 7631.55s]  Coming out.
[7631.63s -> 7632.75s]  Oh, good that you grabbed me.
[7635.68s -> 7636.16s]  All right.
[7636.16s -> 7636.64s]  There we go.
[7638.42s -> 7639.46s]  Oh, this is going to be big.
[7639.46s -> 7640.10s]  Instead of you.
[7640.90s -> 7643.34s]  How do you block fire?
[7643.90s -> 7644.86s]  It's an element.
[7645.58s -> 7648.46s]  I don't know, but I'm going to keep him here.
[7651.94s -> 7653.06s]  That was good.
[7653.06s -> 7654.98s]  Swap to the wand.
[7654.98s -> 7656.34s]  I have it out already, don't I?
[7656.34s -> 7657.36s]  Yeah, you have out.
[7659.78s -> 7660.82s]  Propaganda.
[7660.82s -> 7664.50s]  You got that raging coming in behind you as well.
[7665.54s -> 7670.54s]  I mean, look out behind you.
[7670.54s -> 7672.62s]  I'm going sicko mode.
[7679.20s -> 7679.52s]  All right.
[7683.84s -> 7684.64s]  Thornfang.
[7688.06s -> 7689.26s]  I wonder if we save these people.
[7695.63s -> 7696.43s]  Damn.
[7696.43s -> 7698.75s]  Oh, yellow knife.
[7705.87s -> 7708.99s]  Oh, whoa.
[7708.99s -> 7709.79s]  All right, I'm going to move.
[7711.15s -> 7712.77s]  I'm coming down here.
[7712.77s -> 7717.94s]  Thank you.
[7724.96s -> 7728.56s]  Why can't I use the fire?
[7728.56s -> 7730.64s]  When you use it, you threw the fire itself.
[7730.64s -> 7733.28s]  Oh, the fire itself was thrown.
[7733.28s -> 7735.04s]  All right, I'm going to move this one over here.
[7738.18s -> 7739.22s]  What do I want to move you to?
[7742.66s -> 7743.06s]  Never mind.
[7743.06s -> 7743.94s]  They're dead.
[7743.94s -> 7746.80s]  Really?
[7746.80s -> 7747.76s]  I can't really.
[7747.76s -> 7749.90s]  I guess I could infuse with like this.
[7750.70s -> 7754.34s]  I'm out of actions now.
[7754.34s -> 7758.03s]  Sicko mode.
[7758.03s -> 7758.99s]  How do you move people?
[7758.99s -> 7759.39s]  I wonder.
[7771.18s -> 7772.22s]  Oh, big damage.
[7772.78s -> 7777.18s]  OK, where was the bomb?
[7777.18s -> 7779.10s]  Because it was all the way to the right.
[7779.10s -> 7782.43s]  OK, let's start heading there.
[7782.43s -> 7784.59s]  I think that's where the beast will come from.
[7785.15s -> 7795.84s]  I got to defuse.
[7798.64s -> 7800.16s]  There's tentacles coming out of this thing.
[7800.16s -> 7806.72s]  It's probably going to be a boss in here.
[7807.60s -> 7807.84s]  Yeah.
[7810.86s -> 7812.14s]  I don't know if you guys want to get too close.
[7812.14s -> 7813.10s]  If you want to set up over there.
[7813.66s -> 7814.94s]  Sicko mode.
[7815.50s -> 7816.22s]  He's just going in.
[7820.11s -> 7822.75s]  I'm just I don't want to get hit by whatever opens this door.
[7822.75s -> 7826.37s]  OK, I think we I'm just going to wait a time and then we'll open next time.
[7829.30s -> 7830.58s]  Oh, the Gorgon.
[7830.58s -> 7834.48s]  The silent slithering approach fascinates the mind and haunts the heart.
[7836.80s -> 7837.52s]  Oh, shit.
[7837.52s -> 7837.76s]  OK.
[7839.10s -> 7839.74s]  Anything in there?
[7841.52s -> 7842.32s]  Let's find out.
[7842.88s -> 7844.34s]  Can't see anything.
[7845.89s -> 7852.69s]  12 health.
[7852.69s -> 7855.65s]  Wait, I think I think I can illuminate something.
[7855.65s -> 7857.63s]  I could try or I could just.
[7857.63s -> 7858.51s]  Oh, God.
[7858.51s -> 7859.07s]  Oh, God.
[7862.48s -> 7863.28s]  I'm surrounded.
[7863.84s -> 7864.48s]  OK.
[7864.48s -> 7864.88s]  OK.
[7864.88s -> 7865.20s]  OK.
[7865.84s -> 7879.02s]  He fucked me.
[7879.02s -> 7880.14s]  Why did it so that I'd have him?
[7880.78s -> 7881.90s]  They got he dodged.
[7881.90s -> 7882.62s]  I guess.
[7882.62s -> 7882.94s]  Yeah.
[7882.94s -> 7885.34s]  No, I gain an action when I kill things, but that's probably better.
[7890.72s -> 7893.76s]  Oh, I've got you, Thomas.
[7895.97s -> 7896.21s]  Nice.
[7899.66s -> 7901.02s]  Remember when I was a guy.
[7910.99s -> 7911.71s]  Come on, guys.
[7911.71s -> 7912.19s]  Finish him.
[7915.26s -> 7916.62s]  I tried to move him.
[7916.62s -> 7917.74s]  Wait, did you see that?
[7918.46s -> 7920.51s]  You did a big amount of damage.
[7921.15s -> 7922.91s]  No, because it attacked Thomas last time.
[7922.91s -> 7924.91s]  He got plus four damage for lover's vengeance.
[7925.47s -> 7926.91s]  Yeah, I've been getting that.
[7926.91s -> 7927.23s]  Really?
[7927.95s -> 7928.11s]  Yeah.
[7928.75s -> 7929.87s]  I fucking love you, dude.
[7930.59s -> 7934.03s]  Let's give that to Thomas because that will take his bonus damage up by one.
[7934.03s -> 7934.83s]  Mario noise.
[7935.39s -> 7936.51s]  Did I just do a Mario noise?
[7939.07s -> 7940.59s]  I'm a Blue Horn warrior.
[7941.31s -> 7941.79s]  OK.
[7944.48s -> 7946.16s]  I can force a photo attack me.
[7947.60s -> 7949.92s]  My melee attacks just deal one damage.
[7949.92s -> 7950.80s]  That sounds pretty good.
[7952.74s -> 7955.62s]  My melee attacks deal more based on the health I'm missing.
[7956.50s -> 7961.92s]  These all sound kind of good.
[7962.72s -> 7964.00s]  Yeah, I kind of like viciousness.
[7964.00s -> 7965.76s]  Just one more damage.
[7965.76s -> 7970.13s]  You never go wrong with extra damage.
[7970.13s -> 7972.77s]  Sentinel looks like if I charge someone, it steals their movements.
[7972.77s -> 7973.81s]  They can't get to you guys.
[7977.01s -> 7978.69s]  But if you just kill them.
[7978.69s -> 7979.41s]  Yeah, you're right.
[7982.74s -> 7983.94s]  That could have gone worse.
[7984.90s -> 7990.05s]  Yeah, but it's certainly not your standard plow mule.
[7992.42s -> 7995.38s]  The hulking carcass steams from its many wounds.
[7995.38s -> 7999.46s]  Hideous convulsions course along its appendages to the extremities of its body.
[8000.10s -> 8017.39s]  Then why you know the things tremendous tail flicks across the barn.
[8017.39s -> 8020.27s]  It plucks up in on like he's a straw doll.
[8020.27s -> 8023.95s]  His weapons falling uselessly from his hands as it pulls him in.
[8026.93s -> 8027.73s]  Don't panic.
[8028.29s -> 8031.74s]  A voice leaks from a non's mouth.
[8032.70s -> 8034.22s]  It's a wrong voice.
[8034.22s -> 8038.46s]  Weird and discordant, like some fretting and plucking in a fiddle.
[8038.46s -> 8039.50s]  Who's ever picked one up?
[8041.98s -> 8046.06s]  Still yourselves, bone stacks.
[8046.94s -> 8050.22s]  This one speaks my words.
[8051.49s -> 8052.13s]  I shoot him.
[8054.78s -> 8058.06s]  I can make it die.
[8064.72s -> 8068.50s]  You are not alike to us.
[8068.50s -> 8071.78s]  Weak lungs, small minds.
[8072.50s -> 8075.78s]  Stacks of splintering bones.
[8076.58s -> 8080.66s]  Thin blood that will so readily betray you.
[8081.54s -> 8084.26s]  Why flail for your lives?
[8084.98s -> 8086.98s]  So noisy.
[8090.75s -> 8092.59s]  Be wise now.
[8092.59s -> 8094.27s]  Will you survive if you hurt him?
[8096.38s -> 8100.86s]  You think I flail for life as you do?
[8101.82s -> 8103.98s]  I am Gorgon.
[8104.78s -> 8111.10s]  The master Ulsterix has promised us silence.
[8112.30s -> 8115.34s]  The voice dissolves into a sound like rain or distant waves.
[8116.46s -> 8118.14s]  Wriggling grips tighten.
[8118.14s -> 8120.30s]  A tentacle invades in his ear.
[8123.18s -> 8123.50s]  Stop.
[8124.30s -> 8126.32s]  I really gave that one my all.
[8127.79s -> 8129.79s]  Thomas leaps forward in an instant.
[8129.79s -> 8132.43s]  Rusty saw leaps off the iron book hooks.
[8132.43s -> 8134.83s]  Metal ribbiting and rippling loudly.
[8135.47s -> 8136.43s]  Stop, I said.
[8136.99s -> 8141.84s]  Are you using your magic power to throw a sword?
[8147.57s -> 8154.62s]  The saw slices into the neck of the great beast.
[8161.18s -> 8163.66s]  As the longest rushes over to make certain of the Gorgon's-
[8163.66s -> 8165.18s]  Wait, go back a scene, go back a scene.
[8165.82s -> 8166.78s]  Look what happened to my face.
[8167.34s -> 8168.94s]  Look at the blue on my face.
[8169.74s -> 8171.58s]  Yes, you're going to be the next Marvel hero.
[8172.22s -> 8174.53s]  Is this my origin story?
[8175.42s -> 8176.46s]  Your eye's going to grow back.
[8177.26s -> 8180.38s]  As the longest rushes over to make certain of the Gorgon's demise,
[8180.38s -> 8183.26s]  Thomas supports Inon, helping him to stand.
[8184.86s -> 8187.10s]  Somebody said, you're only useful in cutscenes.
[8188.14s -> 8189.74s]  I'm doing okay, all right?
[8190.78s -> 8191.34s]  You're okay.
[8191.98s -> 8195.36s]  A strange stony affliction spreads from Inon's ear.
[8197.04s -> 8197.54s]  Inon?
[8203.14s -> 8204.10s]  This isn't over.
[8206.69s -> 8207.73s]  I saw his mind.
[8208.69s -> 8210.37s]  The stone was in his heart.
[8210.37s -> 8214.10s]  Inon takes the stone from a longus's palm,
[8214.10s -> 8215.22s]  turning it in front of his eyes,
[8215.22s -> 8217.94s]  catching the slender sunbeams that slice the barn wall.
[8217.94s -> 8221.06s]  The strange, polyhedral stone is slick with the Gorgon's blood.
[8222.02s -> 8222.74s]  Epichrist.
[8227.12s -> 8230.08s]  Each face is graven with an intricate image.
[8230.80s -> 8234.38s]  The word in the Gorgon's head was epichrist.
[8237.26s -> 8239.90s]  This tan, livergram air engine.
[8240.62s -> 8242.94s]  These petrified people, even this monster,
[8243.50s -> 8245.98s]  they're insignificant in the coming epoch.
[8246.62s -> 8250.38s]  The epichrist glistens, sticky and blue.
[8251.55s -> 8253.55s]  The Gorgons have a master.
[8253.55s -> 8254.75s]  Ulstrix, it's called.
[8255.31s -> 8258.75s]  He's looking for something, some myth or secret.
[8258.75s -> 8260.27s]  I think the riddle is in the stone.
[8262.35s -> 8264.99s]  I think we have to find out what he wants.
[8265.95s -> 8267.63s]  And make sure he doesn't get it.
[8268.86s -> 8271.26s]  I think we should, we all I think said that collectively.
[8272.06s -> 8272.56s]  Yeah.
[8273.18s -> 8276.22s]  So I lost a bunch of charisma because I got a fucked up face
[8276.22s -> 8277.66s]  and became a gigaloner.
[8278.22s -> 8280.94s]  And Thomas gained 10 years on his career.
[8282.85s -> 8283.65s]  That works for me.
[8283.65s -> 8285.41s]  One of us came off better.
[8287.07s -> 8289.39s]  Okay, so that is chapter one done.
[8289.87s -> 8292.99s]  So now it kind of tells us all the resources
[8292.99s -> 8295.94s]  and it says 10 years of peace follow.
[8295.94s -> 8297.71s]  10 years of peace.
[8297.71s -> 8298.91s]  Yeah, we did that.
[8299.71s -> 8300.99s]  So we lose some cards.
[8300.99s -> 8304.03s]  They lose some cards because 10 years of peace.
[8304.03s -> 8305.47s]  During the years of peace.
[8305.47s -> 8306.77s]  What happened?
[8306.77s -> 8311.34s]  The Gorgon's Mark grew and crusted over to cover one side of Inan's face.
[8311.34s -> 8313.58s]  It would be a grim reminder of the encounter that day
[8313.58s -> 8315.02s]  in the lithogram air engine barn.
[8315.02s -> 8316.38s]  Good job I'm blind on that side.
[8317.42s -> 8318.30s]  Yeah, that's true.
[8319.02s -> 8321.23s]  On his more civilized days,
[8321.23s -> 8324.27s]  Alongus would drop into town for gossip and tool repairs.
[8324.27s -> 8330.03s]  But on the whole, he felt clear headed among his wilder kin.
[8330.03s -> 8331.95s]  Now that the job wasn't quite as dangerous,
[8331.95s -> 8333.71s]  Alongus became a guide to travelers
[8333.71s -> 8338.37s]  crossing the more treacherous stretches of the swamp and the mountain.
[8338.37s -> 8340.93s]  Thomas and Alongus were married and one winter night
[8340.93s -> 8345.09s]  they held an ancient and evocative ceremony that Alongus had read of.
[8345.09s -> 8346.69s]  A feast followed.
[8346.69s -> 8350.53s]  The people of Sleeping Top were startled but pleased at the generosity.
[8350.53s -> 8351.73s]  Thomas displayed that night.
[8352.21s -> 8353.97s]  Alongus would always remember the moment
[8353.97s -> 8357.25s]  like a scene brought to life from history, from legend.
[8357.25s -> 8363.70s]  And he, he and Thomas indelibly written into the world's pages.
[8363.70s -> 8364.82s]  Transformations.
[8364.82s -> 8369.14s]  You have a choice to advance Alongus's transformation and get a wolf arm.
[8369.14s -> 8372.26s]  You'll be able to get a wolf claw for five to eight damage.
[8372.26s -> 8374.10s]  Yeah.
[8374.10s -> 8374.50s]  Okay.
[8374.50s -> 8377.86s]  Oh, you got like a whole inventory page, yeah.
[8377.86s -> 8381.22s]  Yeah, so basically you can see our current resources in the top left
[8381.22s -> 8383.46s]  and then we can click whichever player we want
[8383.46s -> 8384.66s]  and we can kind of kit them out.
[8385.39s -> 8386.27s]  With new upgrades.
[8386.27s -> 8388.99s]  So if we wanted to make you like a tier two bow
[8388.99s -> 8392.19s]  it would use up four hotwoods, an ingot, a hide, a fabric.
[8392.19s -> 8394.27s]  We could craft it and then give it to you.
[8394.27s -> 8396.59s]  So it's kind of like what are we missing?
[8396.59s -> 8397.23s]  What do we need?
[8397.23s -> 8397.87s]  That kind of thing.
[8399.82s -> 8401.82s]  I would say looking at our stuff
[8401.82s -> 8404.22s]  Thomas is the only one that doesn't have any armor.
[8404.22s -> 8405.84s]  So maybe we-
[8405.84s -> 8406.56s]  I don't, yeah.
[8406.56s -> 8413.30s]  Like maybe we click this and maybe we want to craft Thomas like a dusty drab
[8413.94s -> 8415.54s]  or an ember gown.
[8415.54s -> 8417.38s]  Which one of these like do you like the look of?
[8418.99s -> 8419.39s]  Let's see.
[8424.75s -> 8427.95s]  And so for every piece of like resource we're missing
[8427.95s -> 8429.31s]  we can spend an LP.
[8429.31s -> 8430.43s]  So we only have one fabric
[8430.43s -> 8433.23s]  but we can use an LP to make an extra fabric.
[8433.23s -> 8436.27s]  So these two star ones are expensive.
[8437.63s -> 8439.14s]  Yeah, we can click it and look.
[8439.14s -> 8441.30s]  So that would be- it would cost us three LP
[8441.30s -> 8443.86s]  but I think that's fine if you wanted to go for that.
[8443.86s -> 8446.74s]  I mean this drab, this two star drab seems like it's pretty good.
[8446.74s -> 8448.26s]  Three armor, two warning, one spell damage.
[8448.26s -> 8449.06s]  All right, yeah.
[8449.06s -> 8450.34s]  So just click craft.
[8450.34s -> 8452.77s]  Oh yeah.
[8452.77s -> 8456.50s]  Let's go.
[8456.50s -> 8457.98s]  There you go.
[8457.98s -> 8459.28s]  Snare your kid out.
[8459.28s -> 8461.81s]  Sweet.
[8462.51s -> 8464.11s]  So we've got a bunch of stuff left.
[8465.25s -> 8467.86s]  Let's have a look what we could do.
[8467.86s -> 8471.44s]  Would you rather have like a bow over like armor?
[8474.14s -> 8477.02s]  I want a dueling sword so I can be a rapier wielding wolf.
[8477.02s -> 8479.62s]  It just makes sense.
[8479.62s -> 8480.12s]  Okay.
[8482.66s -> 8485.62s]  As a ranger you can use a dueling sword up here
[8485.62s -> 8488.10s]  so we can make the giant scratch.
[8488.10s -> 8488.60s]  Yeah.
[8489.94s -> 8494.46s]  Or we could make the dueling sword.
[8494.46s -> 8495.98s]  There's only one damage difference
[8495.98s -> 8496.86s]  and this one cost nine.
[8498.14s -> 8499.18s]  I'm making it.
[8499.18s -> 8501.89s]  Okay, you're making the tier two or the tier one?
[8501.89s -> 8502.69s]  Tier two.
[8502.69s -> 8506.53s]  You have such a cool character.
[8506.53s -> 8507.03s]  Okay.
[8507.81s -> 8508.69s]  And on go first.
[8511.36s -> 8513.65s]  I think Anna needs just a big weapon.
[8513.65s -> 8516.82s]  I think I need a better than this spear.
[8516.82s -> 8518.66s]  What we got?
[8518.66s -> 8521.54s]  I'm thinking like a gray axe or something.
[8521.54s -> 8528.90s]  Ooh, like a mace maybe?
[8528.90s -> 8530.24s]  Do we have a hammer?
[8530.24s -> 8533.17s]  Yeah, gray axe or a great sword.
[8533.17s -> 8540.26s]  You think I'm more of a hammer guy or do you think I'm like a...
[8543.30s -> 8543.78s]  I don't know.
[8546.18s -> 8547.54s]  I feel like this is a hammer.
[8549.49s -> 8551.46s]  You're going to turn into a golem.
[8551.46s -> 8554.34s]  Golems are required by law to use hammers and maces.
[8554.34s -> 8559.97s]  That's just how it goes.
[8559.97s -> 8561.73s]  Golem with an axe, you're going to get laughed at.
[8567.89s -> 8569.57s]  Although great axe works too.
[8569.57s -> 8574.27s]  If we craft this we can only make the tier one rapier though.
[8574.27s -> 8574.91s]  We can't have that.
[8574.91s -> 8576.03s]  Star has to have the best weapon.
[8577.23s -> 8577.87s]  That's fine.
[8584.02s -> 8585.38s]  The mountain break.
[8585.38s -> 8586.18s]  That's what it's named.
[8586.18s -> 8587.14s]  I'm going to reroll it.
[8587.14s -> 8590.02s]  Tower sludger.
[8590.02s -> 8591.12s]  Yes.
[8591.12s -> 8591.76s]  Ooh.
[8591.76s -> 8592.54s]  Okay.
[8592.54s -> 8593.98s]  And then we've got this boy.
[8593.98s -> 8594.62s]  We can actually...
[8595.18s -> 8596.38s]  So you want a dueling sword?
[8596.46s -> 8601.04s]  We can make you a dueling sword and we could also make you a tier two crossbow.
[8609.49s -> 8612.16s]  Oh, I got disconnected.
[8612.16s -> 8614.56s]  We're out of money for ingots.
[8614.56s -> 8615.84s]  Why did I get disconnected?
[8615.84s -> 8617.04s]  We can use LP though.
[8617.04s -> 8617.44s]  I don't know.
[8617.44s -> 8619.20s]  Why are you running?
[8619.20s -> 8620.40s]  We can save and remake.
[8620.40s -> 8622.32s]  I think you could just rejoin actually.
[8622.32s -> 8623.36s]  Can I just rejoin?
[8623.36s -> 8624.77s]  I think so.
[8624.77s -> 8626.14s]  Let me try and rejoin.
[8628.29s -> 8629.33s]  Okay, disconnect.
[8633.86s -> 8636.32s]  It's thinking.
[8636.32s -> 8641.09s]  I think it might be crashing.
[8641.09s -> 8641.73s]  Okay.
[8641.73s -> 8644.77s]  Should I just do play or my legacy?
[8644.77s -> 8650.80s]  There's this play and there's also my legacy.
[8650.80s -> 8652.24s]  Do I have to select that character maybe?
[8653.79s -> 8654.83s]  I'm not sure.
[8654.83s -> 8656.35s]  I think we can remake the lobby.
[8656.35s -> 8657.87s]  I can just save and we can remake it.
[8661.02s -> 8661.58s]  Okay.
[8661.58s -> 8665.52s]  Let's let our boy build what he needs though.
[8665.52s -> 8666.48s]  I finished building that.
[8666.48s -> 8667.44s]  I clicked next.
[8667.44s -> 8668.86s]  Okay, let's do...
[8668.86s -> 8669.50s]  Okay.
[8669.50s -> 8671.62s]  Last save was three seconds ago.
[8671.62s -> 8672.98s]  Steam maintenance Tuesday.
[8674.42s -> 8675.70s]  Oh, that's what it is.
[8675.70s -> 8677.30s]  Is that what it actually is?
[8677.30s -> 8678.50s]  It's going to get all of us, yeah.
[8678.50s -> 8678.98s]  Oh, no.
[8680.59s -> 8681.95s]  It only takes like five minutes or so.
[8681.95s -> 8682.45s]  Yeah.
[8688.90s -> 8689.70s]  Five minute break.
[8689.70s -> 8693.86s]  I don't know if you guys can even see this or if I can save.
[8693.86s -> 8694.66s]  I don't...
[8694.66s -> 8696.74s]  Boy, you know, Strippin was the leader, I think.
[8696.74s -> 8697.06s]  So do you...
[8697.06s -> 8698.74s]  Save and quit is currently grayed out.
[8699.54s -> 8701.22s]  But it saved 30 seconds ago.
[8701.22s -> 8701.78s]  So...
[8701.78s -> 8706.02s]  So are all of our characters on your kind of client side
[8706.02s -> 8707.62s]  or do we have those here on ours?
[8707.62s -> 8708.02s]  I wonder.
[8708.02s -> 8710.18s]  I believe it's just on mine because I'm hosting.
[8710.18s -> 8710.42s]  Yeah.
[8710.42s -> 8711.86s]  So we can just remake it but...
[8711.86s -> 8713.57s]  Okay.
[8713.57s -> 8716.61s]  Yeah, we can just wait for a steam maintenance, I guess.
[8716.61s -> 8718.93s]  Is that actually what happened or can people confirm that
[8718.93s -> 8721.52s]  or are people just being goofy?
[8721.52s -> 8722.48s]  I'm online.
[8722.48s -> 8725.76s]  I don't know if you're offline on Steam or if you live time.
[8725.76s -> 8728.69s]  I know.
[8728.69s -> 8731.18s]  Somebody said, I got it too.
[8731.18s -> 8731.50s]  It's real.
[8731.50s -> 8732.06s]  I got it.
[8732.06s -> 8732.62s]  Okay.
[8732.62s -> 8735.47s]  Let's see.
[8735.47s -> 8736.35s]  Friends.
[8736.35s -> 8738.46s]  Yeah, it says I'm disconnected.
[8738.46s -> 8739.42s]  Let me try to get back in.
[8741.55s -> 8747.57s]  I'm going to add you to friends anyway.
[8747.57s -> 8748.13s]  Steam.
[8748.85s -> 8750.29s]  Oh, okay.
[8750.29s -> 8751.49s]  I can't even add you as a friend.
[8754.42s -> 8756.86s]  Good old Steam Maintenance Tuesday.
[8756.86s -> 8758.94s]  Oh, yeah.
[8758.94s -> 8762.22s]  The thing is like this has been happening consistently on a Tuesday for like 10 years
[8762.22s -> 8764.62s]  and every week I forget it exists until it happens.
[8764.62s -> 8766.50s]  Seriously, same thing.
[8766.50s -> 8768.42s]  I think I actually had a meltdown on stream one time
[8768.42s -> 8770.98s]  where I said I would never be live ever again
[8770.98s -> 8775.47s]  between like 12 and 5 p.m. on Tuesday ever again.
[8775.47s -> 8777.70s]  I think I say that every single Tuesday this happens.
[8777.70s -> 8779.30s]  Next week you were live between 12 and...
[8780.90s -> 8781.86s]  This is what I'm saying.
[8781.86s -> 8783.74s]  Like it's time to go to the...
[8783.74s -> 8787.25s]  Let's all go to the Epic Games Store.
[8787.25s -> 8788.13s]  Gamers rise up.
[8791.39s -> 8792.11s]  I'm going to go pee.
[8792.11s -> 8792.83s]  I'll be back.
[8792.83s -> 8793.39s]  Okay.
[8793.39s -> 8795.49s]  Hopefully it comes right back and doesn't...
[8795.49s -> 8798.34s]  Because sometimes it takes like 30 plus minutes.
[8798.34s -> 8799.22s]  Wait, really?
[8799.22s -> 8800.34s]  This happened before, yeah.
[8800.34s -> 8801.63s]  We'll find out.
[8801.63s -> 8802.35s]  I'll be right back.
[8802.35s -> 8805.42s]  Hold on.
[8805.42s -> 8807.58s]  Ashley called me two hours ago?
[8807.58s -> 8814.11s]  Okay.
[8814.11s -> 8814.67s]  Weird.
[8814.67s -> 8817.34s]  I'll be right back.
[8817.34s -> 8818.42s]  Okay.
[8818.42s -> 8833.39s]  So how long is Dr. Ted down for?
[8834.03s -> 8834.83s]  When does it come out?
[8835.79s -> 8839.63s]  I thought it would have come out in like an hour.
[8840.51s -> 8844.88s]  Back to the little stream.
[8845.44s -> 8850.22s]  10 a.m. PST tomorrow.
[8851.42s -> 8855.52s]  That's my stream start time.
[8856.80s -> 8879.20s]  The second Mario movie trailer was fun.
[8880.24s -> 8884.22s]  Does Mario still sound like Linda from Bob's Burgers?
[8889.07s -> 8892.16s]  Oh, yes.
[8892.72s -> 8936.46s]  I have such a luscious beard.
[8936.46s -> 8936.94s]  Thank you.
[8939.49s -> 8941.33s]  You have such a luscious beard.
[8941.89s -> 8943.81s]  Are you guys enjoying the stream?
[8943.81s -> 8944.61s]  Why'd you ignore me?
[8945.65s -> 8946.21s]  Thanks, man.
[8946.93s -> 8956.24s]  I feel like we're having a really great adventure.
[8957.04s -> 8958.62s]  I feel like...
[8962.16s -> 8964.24s]  Chad did a prediction on who was going to be the third whale
[8964.24s -> 8966.32s]  and it has 100% ended up being me.
[8967.36s -> 8967.92s]  It was inevitable.
[8967.92s -> 8969.36s]  You guys literally got married.
[8969.36s -> 8972.08s]  We really got like one romance option
[8972.08s -> 8973.44s]  and I was like, okay, let's get married.
[8974.16s -> 8978.08s]  Like four years ago, I was a little bit saucy
[8978.08s -> 8980.16s]  and it just from there was obvious.
[8981.28s -> 8983.76s]  Yeah, you're a little bit handsy like five years ago.
[8985.30s -> 8987.54s]  I just like complimented him like one time.
[8988.66s -> 8989.86s]  I think I don't even remember.
[8990.42s -> 8993.71s]  Yeah, it was getting super fun.
[8993.71s -> 8994.83s]  I slept on.
[8994.83s -> 9011.01s]  Remember when you stripped for charity on the Oaks Coast a decade ago?
[9011.01s -> 9011.41s]  I do.
[9012.69s -> 9013.57s]  I do.
[9013.57s -> 9018.38s]  I don't.
[9018.38s -> 9019.74s]  I don't have that memory.
[9019.74s -> 9020.30s]  Yes, you do.
[9021.26s -> 9022.46s]  I did not know about that,
[9022.46s -> 9025.34s]  but I'm going to be Googling that intensively tonight.
[9027.07s -> 9028.03s]  Tonight?
[9028.03s -> 9028.27s]  Yes.
[9031.07s -> 9035.28s]  You would be cheating on Thomas.
[9036.46s -> 9037.26s]  He doesn't care.
[9039.04s -> 9040.56s]  Are you sure?
[9041.12s -> 9042.16s]  Have you asked him?
[9042.88s -> 9044.64s]  When he comes back, we can ask him
[9045.62s -> 9048.10s]  how seriously he's taking our relationship.
[9048.10s -> 9052.42s]  How do you guys make out?
[9052.42s -> 9052.98s]  You're a wolf.
[9055.82s -> 9058.54s]  You know, you don't have to kiss to show affection
[9058.54s -> 9060.22s]  and I've got one human arm.
[9060.22s -> 9061.42s]  I just use that.
[9061.42s -> 9062.62s]  You guys like Eskimo kiss?
[9063.26s -> 9064.14s]  Like touch noses?
[9065.66s -> 9069.30s]  No, I sniff his behind.
[9069.30s -> 9075.54s]  Oh, oh.
[9075.54s -> 9076.58s]  Just keep it real.
[9076.58s -> 9078.90s]  You know, just keep it 100.
[9079.86s -> 9080.36s]  Yeah.
[9083.26s -> 9083.98s]  Staying true to me.
[9086.64s -> 9087.60s]  Is it back?
[9087.60s -> 9093.82s]  Looks like Steam is back.
[9094.54s -> 9095.04s]  Okay.
[9098.58s -> 9099.30s]  Nuzzles you.
[9100.45s -> 9100.95s]  Wait.
[9101.57s -> 9102.85s]  Yeah, nuzzles you.
[9102.85s -> 9104.11s]  It looks like it's back.
[9104.11s -> 9107.54s]  What?
[9107.54s -> 9108.04s]  What are you doing?
[9108.98s -> 9109.86s]  I'm nuzzling you.
[9109.86s -> 9110.74s]  He's nuzzling you.
[9110.74s -> 9113.62s]  Oh, I didn't know who you were talking to.
[9114.58s -> 9115.70s]  Oh, we're married, dude.
[9119.17s -> 9120.85s]  I don't even know.
[9120.85s -> 9121.49s]  All right.
[9121.49s -> 9125.81s]  Okay.
[9126.43s -> 9131.78s]  This is what married couples do.
[9131.78s -> 9134.10s]  So should we just try and remake, I guess?
[9134.10s -> 9134.66s]  I guess.
[9134.66s -> 9135.54s]  It looks like we're back, right?
[9136.75s -> 9137.15s]  Yeah.
[9137.15s -> 9139.47s]  It won't let me save and quit though
[9139.47s -> 9142.62s]  because we're like stuck in a story thing.
[9142.62s -> 9145.90s]  Should we just try to join off you again?
[9145.90s -> 9147.90s]  Yeah. Did you add me?
[9147.90s -> 9149.60s]  Let's see.
[9152.34s -> 9155.02s]  You might on Steam.
[9155.02s -> 9158.06s]  That is a great question considering I, dude,
[9158.06s -> 9160.14s]  I don't know how to even do that anymore.
[9160.14s -> 9161.27s]  Oh, okay.
[9162.21s -> 9167.49s]  If you open your friends list in the top right,
[9167.49s -> 9169.81s]  it says like add friends like a little man with a plus sign.
[9170.61s -> 9173.78s]  And then you just pop my friend code in there.
[9173.78s -> 9174.66s]  Oh, cool.
[9174.66s -> 9177.38s]  I haven't done this in a long time.
[9177.38s -> 9180.53s]  Okay.
[9180.53s -> 9181.33s]  That's you.
[9181.33s -> 9186.30s]  Send invite.
[9186.30s -> 9187.02s]  Show auto?
[9188.98s -> 9190.34s]  No, I'm not going to show auto.
[9190.34s -> 9190.98s]  Hang it out down.
[9194.98s -> 9196.32s]  Okay.
[9196.32s -> 9198.32s]  And then invite to lobby.
[9198.32s -> 9199.78s]  Let's see if this works.
[9199.78s -> 9200.82s]  He's down that way.
[9200.82s -> 9202.93s]  He's down there.
[9202.93s -> 9203.57s]  I'm not going to go.
[9203.57s -> 9205.14s]  Invite works.
[9205.14s -> 9206.46s]  Show auto.
[9206.54s -> 9208.94s]  No, I don't want to go get auto.
[9208.94s -> 9209.74s]  He's probably comfortable.
[9213.04s -> 9214.88s]  Did you say you tried to invite me?
[9214.88s -> 9221.39s]  Yeah, I'm in there.
[9221.39s -> 9227.33s]  I don't see an invite.
[9227.33s -> 9227.97s]  You don't?
[9227.97s -> 9228.85s]  I do not.
[9228.85s -> 9232.42s]  You mean like on like the Steam kind of like boom,
[9232.42s -> 9233.46s]  you got invited to something?
[9233.46s -> 9234.10s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9234.10s -> 9238.62s]  No, I'm ice cream sandwich, by the way, just in case.
[9238.62s -> 9241.82s]  I sent you an invite to lobby.
[9241.82s -> 9246.05s]  Can you join game with me?
[9246.05s -> 9247.33s]  That's what I'm trying to do here.
[9247.33s -> 9247.89s]  Yeah, let's see.
[9248.69s -> 9250.13s]  Let's say join game.
[9257.30s -> 9257.94s]  Let's get started.
[9257.94s -> 9259.54s]  I think we can just auto forward.
[9259.54s -> 9261.46s]  Yeah, I'm just going to restart the game.
[9261.46s -> 9264.58s]  I think that maybe when it was the Steam maintenance happened,
[9264.58s -> 9267.86s]  it maybe has to be rebooted or something.
[9267.86s -> 9270.70s]  Thank you, Gaben.
[9270.70s -> 9271.18s]  You know what?
[9273.23s -> 9274.19s]  It's what?
[9274.19s -> 9280.90s]  Three o'clock in the afternoon Pacific,
[9280.90s -> 9282.02s]  like right in the middle of the day.
[9282.02s -> 9282.58s]  Time.
[9282.58s -> 9284.26s]  Let's say it's an inconsiderate time.
[9284.26s -> 9285.06s]  That's what it is.
[9285.06s -> 9285.78s]  How dare they?
[9285.78s -> 9286.34s]  I'm just kidding.
[9288.78s -> 9289.34s]  All right.
[9289.34s -> 9290.14s]  I'm back in.
[9290.14s -> 9292.22s]  Let's see if I can join you.
[9292.22s -> 9292.62s]  Okay.
[9292.62s -> 9293.42s]  I'm actually going to.
[9297.25s -> 9297.81s]  All right.
[9297.81s -> 9300.13s]  I am trying to join you right now.
[9300.13s -> 9307.68s]  I'm remaking the game.
[9307.68s -> 9310.08s]  Otto's comfy gaming in his gaming room.
[9310.08s -> 9310.82s]  Okay.
[9310.82s -> 9311.38s]  You should be.
[9311.38s -> 9312.34s]  You should be able to join me.
[9312.34s -> 9315.18s]  I made a friend's lobby and then I'll load the.
[9315.18s -> 9315.90s]  Hey, I can see it.
[9315.90s -> 9316.77s]  Yep.
[9316.77s -> 9319.66s]  There it is.
[9319.66s -> 9320.06s]  All right.
[9322.59s -> 9323.07s]  Hey, there we go.
[9323.07s -> 9324.06s]  I'm in.
[9324.06s -> 9327.14s]  Yeah, you're in this.
[9327.14s -> 9328.35s]  I'm in.
[9328.35s -> 9328.75s]  I'm in.
[9329.47s -> 9330.11s]  Okay.
[9330.11s -> 9330.67s]  He's not.
[9330.67s -> 9332.75s]  I can't see the current panel, though.
[9332.75s -> 9333.87s]  It's like blank.
[9333.87s -> 9334.83s]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[9334.83s -> 9336.70s]  We made the lobby.
[9336.70s -> 9338.06s]  Oh, what the hell am I in?
[9339.90s -> 9340.46s]  I don't know.
[9340.46s -> 9341.18s]  I don't know.
[9341.18s -> 9342.22s]  You know, I don't want to know.
[9342.22s -> 9345.74s]  Yeah, sir.
[9345.74s -> 9351.58s]  I had to restart my whole game for it to show up if you didn't do that yet.
[9351.58s -> 9360.51s]  Uh, can you like settle down?
[9360.51s -> 9360.99s]  Yep.
[9360.99s -> 9363.04s]  I'm good.
[9363.04s -> 9363.44s]  Hold on.
[9363.44s -> 9365.76s]  I'm going to restart my game.
[9365.76s -> 9367.28s]  You might be on to something.
[9367.28s -> 9368.96s]  Wait, are you restarting or are you good?
[9368.96s -> 9369.92s]  I'm restarting.
[9384.93s -> 9387.57s]  Man, that's as beautiful as the song we sung together.
[9387.57s -> 9389.09s]  I wonder how that actually turned out.
[9389.09s -> 9394.86s]  All right.
[9394.86s -> 9399.89s]  I wonder, were we even matching the same tempo?
[9399.89s -> 9405.79s]  I who could.
[9405.79s -> 9406.51s]  All right.
[9406.51s -> 9408.43s]  Let's get back in here.
[9408.43s -> 9409.39s]  Can you see it?
[9409.39s -> 9409.95s]  I hope so.
[9412.27s -> 9414.43s]  I see like a blue screen with leaves.
[9414.43s -> 9415.15s]  Mine's blue.
[9415.71s -> 9416.43s]  Gray.
[9416.43s -> 9418.03s]  All right.
[9418.03s -> 9419.39s]  New threats.
[9419.39s -> 9425.33s]  All right.
[9425.33s -> 9425.89s]  Oh, yeah.
[9425.89s -> 9430.61s]  We missed the whole thing then because the last one was talking about like trying to figure out
[9430.61s -> 9432.13s]  what the crystal meant.
[9432.13s -> 9435.25s]  I feel like that might be a way to go back and watch it.
[9435.25s -> 9441.06s]  It's possible it just got kind of sniped from the steam going down.
[9441.06s -> 9441.70s]  That's all right, though.
[9441.70s -> 9442.66s]  We can just fill in the blanks.
[9442.66s -> 9444.29s]  Wow.
[9444.29s -> 9445.81s]  What does this thing do?
[9445.81s -> 9446.69s]  Well, we know you guys.
[9446.69s -> 9448.37s]  We know you guys got married.
[9448.37s -> 9452.13s]  We know that I was just a loner for a long time.
[9452.13s -> 9456.69s]  So look at that.
[9456.69s -> 9460.85s]  We have to go investigate Lambstream Altar.
[9460.85s -> 9461.57s]  Yes.
[9461.57s -> 9463.57s]  How do we reliably get there?
[9463.57s -> 9466.53s]  We're down from sleeping top?
[9468.45s -> 9468.69s]  Yeah.
[9468.69s -> 9471.54s]  We're back in thunder roast now.
[9471.54s -> 9472.50s]  This seems treacherous.
[9472.50s -> 9474.86s]  I feel like this is a treacherous way to go.
[9474.86s -> 9475.10s]  Yeah.
[9475.10s -> 9478.38s]  I think we go into the Dachia Forest, right?
[9478.38s -> 9479.74s]  That's our next play.
[9479.74s -> 9480.70s]  I think that's the play.
[9480.70s -> 9481.98s]  Okay.
[9481.98s -> 9483.90s]  We all aged 10 years.
[9483.98s -> 9485.74s]  So now I'm 39.
[9485.74s -> 9487.18s]  I've got gray in my hair.
[9488.06s -> 9488.46s]  What does it say?
[9488.46s -> 9489.18s]  What does it show your age?
[9490.50s -> 9490.98s]  No, no.
[9490.98s -> 9491.14s]  Yeah.
[9491.14s -> 9492.74s]  If you hover over yourself, it'll tell your age.
[9492.74s -> 9493.22s]  It's weird.
[9493.22s -> 9495.54s]  If you look at my portrait, I've got gray in my hair.
[9495.54s -> 9495.86s]  Hang on.
[9495.86s -> 9498.34s]  I've got side quests.
[9498.34s -> 9499.14s]  I'm the youngest.
[9501.14s -> 9502.34s]  Not one for festivals.
[9508.11s -> 9508.99s]  What's the point?
[9509.73s -> 9512.53s]  No one's having conversations.
[9512.53s -> 9513.33s]  Just songs.
[9513.33s -> 9515.17s]  And I don't like songs now.
[9515.17s -> 9515.33s]  Yeah.
[9515.33s -> 9516.45s]  I thought you loved songs.
[9517.17s -> 9519.01s]  I am over songs.
[9519.01s -> 9523.17s]  Once I went on a two-year trip to sing one.
[9523.17s -> 9523.49s]  Yeah.
[9523.49s -> 9524.77s]  I actually feel the same.
[9524.77s -> 9528.06s]  I love how the panel just completed your other arm.
[9528.06s -> 9535.52s]  But I'm trying to do my community spirit.
[9535.52s -> 9536.32s]  Right.
[9536.32s -> 9536.96s]  Yeah.
[9536.96s -> 9539.36s]  I've gained my chance then.
[9539.36s -> 9543.17s]  Might be stimulating.
[9543.17s -> 9543.57s]  Later.
[9546.21s -> 9550.02s]  That was damn right uncanny.
[9550.02s -> 9551.22s]  It was lucky.
[9553.86s -> 9556.67s]  Honestly though, do you have a secret?
[9557.47s -> 9561.42s]  I've never seen someone roll that well.
[9561.42s -> 9562.38s]  No secret.
[9562.38s -> 9563.98s]  I'll get on these streaks sometimes.
[9563.98s -> 9565.58s]  Cars, dice, coins.
[9565.58s -> 9568.82s]  But now that you mention it, I've always wondered what would
[9568.82s -> 9572.51s]  happen if we were just to pick a direction.
[9572.51s -> 9573.47s]  A direction?
[9575.25s -> 9576.85s]  Just pick a direction and go.
[9576.85s -> 9580.13s]  If I'm really on a hot streak, well, I bet we'll find a magic item.
[9580.85s -> 9582.29s]  Magic item?
[9582.29s -> 9583.17s]  Seriously?
[9583.17s -> 9584.37s]  You really are Scooby-Doo.
[9591.22s -> 9591.70s]  Write him.
[9592.90s -> 9594.00s]  Write him.
[9594.00s -> 9594.24s]  Okay.
[9594.80s -> 9597.01s]  We're all going.
[9597.01s -> 9598.13s]  We're all going.
[9598.13s -> 9598.61s]  Let's go.
[9598.61s -> 9600.78s]  We're just going to pick a direction.
[9600.78s -> 9604.35s]  Apparently.
[9604.35s -> 9606.59s]  My trip took us like three days.
[9606.59s -> 9608.70s]  I see the edge of the forest.
[9608.70s -> 9614.22s]  Oh, I saw this forest as an edge.
[9614.22s -> 9617.89s]  That's nice.
[9617.89s -> 9619.41s]  What the hell was that?
[9619.41s -> 9621.79s]  Everything has an edge.
[9621.79s -> 9623.63s]  Including my patients.
[9623.63s -> 9626.64s]  It's like Yoda too.
[9626.64s -> 9630.32s]  Look, it was a joke in the first place, wasn't it?
[9630.88s -> 9632.96s]  Keep walking until we find a what.
[9632.96s -> 9634.56s]  Why would someone do that?
[9635.12s -> 9639.15s]  Just walk around and wander for no reason.
[9639.15s -> 9642.00s]  Nice to take a little trip with a trip.
[9642.88s -> 9644.40s]  Well, hang on a minute.
[9644.40s -> 9646.40s]  I've walked for two years for you.
[9646.40s -> 9649.28s]  You have no legs to stand on here.
[9649.28s -> 9650.48s]  I'm not seeing the point of this trip.
[9650.48s -> 9651.76s]  I don't understand.
[9651.76s -> 9654.24s]  Well, at least check out that castle first.
[9656.21s -> 9657.63s]  That's so funny.
[9657.63s -> 9657.95s]  Look.
[9657.95s -> 9658.83s]  Why are you huge?
[9658.83s -> 9659.31s]  I'm huge.
[9659.31s -> 9660.03s]  I'm giant.
[9661.95s -> 9665.39s]  Where there's presumably a magic item.
[9667.33s -> 9669.12s]  Follow me, Alungus.
[9669.12s -> 9670.24s]  Yeah, I'm getting bigger.
[9671.76s -> 9672.88s]  You look pissed.
[9672.88s -> 9674.96s]  You do not want to be here right now.
[9674.96s -> 9677.12s]  All right, Gemma, what are we doing?
[9677.12s -> 9680.16s]  Are we going in the front or are we climbing a window or a ledge?
[9680.88s -> 9681.76s]  Make Alungus climb.
[9681.76s -> 9686.70s]  I think that's funnier.
[9686.70s -> 9689.12s]  They climb through a crumbling window.
[9689.12s -> 9691.60s]  You certainly like to make things hard.
[9695.47s -> 9697.15s]  Oh, you're behind my arm.
[9699.90s -> 9701.42s]  I'm thorough.
[9701.42s -> 9705.18s]  Always start at the top of a problem and work your way down.
[9706.22s -> 9710.24s]  Goes for castles too.
[9710.24s -> 9711.12s]  Well, fine.
[9711.12s -> 9712.72s]  That makes some sense, I guess.
[9713.28s -> 9717.55s]  I'll have to tell the age.
[9717.55s -> 9720.67s]  These double beams are a hallmark of even way to build her.
[9720.67s -> 9722.03s]  She's 200 years dead.
[9722.67s -> 9724.99s]  Your neck seems a little stiff.
[9725.71s -> 9726.43s]  So does yours.
[9727.87s -> 9732.85s]  There's a pretty big gap you can see to the lower level.
[9732.85s -> 9735.33s]  Well, this stuff's more recent.
[9735.33s -> 9737.15s]  What stuff?
[9738.75s -> 9739.98s]  Stop.
[9739.98s -> 9741.55s]  Stop that.
[9741.55s -> 9745.57s]  Little trove collected from who knows where.
[9745.57s -> 9746.93s]  Does it look magical?
[9746.93s -> 9749.63s]  Not even a tiny bit.
[9751.79s -> 9753.39s]  That's the first time I've been happy.
[9754.35s -> 9755.23s]  You probably found a bone.
[9755.87s -> 9760.90s]  Tell you what though, it does look guarded.
[9762.02s -> 9764.74s]  Took you that long to see that thing in the room with you guys?
[9764.74s -> 9765.94s]  Yeah, it was there the whole time.
[9765.94s -> 9767.14s]  It was there the entire time.
[9767.94s -> 9768.58s]  The butler.
[9768.58s -> 9769.46s]  Look at this thing.
[9769.46s -> 9772.83s]  Oh my God.
[9772.83s -> 9776.58s]  All right, what do we got?
[9776.58s -> 9777.23s]  Oh my God.
[9777.23s -> 9779.39s]  Look at Thomas, how much magic armour he has.
[9779.39s -> 9781.15s]  I know, I'm unstoppable.
[9783.06s -> 9784.02s]  Actually, I'm going to move again.
[9784.02s -> 9784.82s]  I want to get closer.
[9785.46s -> 9790.32s]  This thing's got a lot of health, by the way.
[9790.40s -> 9799.23s]  Pop them.
[9800.11s -> 9800.43s]  Nice.
[9802.45s -> 9805.41s]  Thomas, if you take damage, I'll get upset.
[9806.29s -> 9806.61s]  All right.
[9806.61s -> 9807.89s]  Well, that was a barrel mode.
[9809.33s -> 9810.05s]  11 damage.
[9810.05s -> 9810.53s]  Holy shit.
[9819.38s -> 9822.82s]  It's remarkable to find one alone like this.
[9822.82s -> 9826.10s]  Up here would be curious what directed its decision.
[9826.74s -> 9829.38s]  If decision is even the right word.
[9829.38s -> 9831.14s]  Well, let's not razz more of them, eh?
[9832.98s -> 9837.44s]  We can grab some of these materials.
[9838.24s -> 9838.64s]  Right.
[9838.64s -> 9839.52s]  That's what I mean.
[9839.52s -> 9840.96s]  And then back where we came.
[9843.92s -> 9845.20s]  A short while later.
[9847.79s -> 9849.71s]  So looks like I won the bet.
[9851.58s -> 9852.70s]  Seems you did.
[9852.70s -> 9853.50s]  You guys were betting?
[9854.38s -> 9856.32s]  What do I owe you now?
[9856.32s -> 9856.82s]  Socks?
[9857.68s -> 9858.64s]  No socks.
[9861.84s -> 9863.92s]  What you failed to mention is a size.
[9870.54s -> 9871.04s]  My neck!
[9873.98s -> 9875.82s]  On the journey back, my neck breaks.
[9875.82s -> 9879.26s]  There's a tea house not far.
[9881.18s -> 9883.98s]  Uh, hold on, but socks?
[9884.70s -> 9886.86s]  There are different socks sizes?
[9886.86s -> 9888.38s]  I thought it was just like a pair of socks.
[9888.38s -> 9889.58s]  It's like universal, isn't it?
[9889.58s -> 9892.54s]  Like size, like five through like 14 or something?
[9894.62s -> 9897.50s]  How would a size 14 foot fit in a size five sock?
[9897.50s -> 9898.22s]  I don't know.
[9898.22s -> 9899.66s]  Aren't socks like just one size?
[9900.30s -> 9901.90s]  No, it's the way like they're like brackets.
[9901.90s -> 9905.74s]  So like a size will be like 10 to 13.
[9905.74s -> 9909.34s]  And then like really nine to five and then like four to one.
[9909.34s -> 9909.66s]  Yeah.
[9909.66s -> 9912.46s]  Is that why sometimes I get fucking fucked up socks that just don't fit?
[9913.18s -> 9913.68s]  Yeah.
[9914.06s -> 9917.97s]  I thought it was just like medium, like medium or big.
[9917.97s -> 9919.17s]  I didn't know they had whatever.
[9921.01s -> 9921.73s]  I'm not kidding.
[9921.73s -> 9922.69s]  I swear to God.
[9922.69s -> 9923.65s]  This makes perfect sense.
[9923.65s -> 9925.73s]  I share socks with my four-year-old daughter.
[9925.73s -> 9926.05s]  Yeah.
[9926.05s -> 9927.01s]  No, I just, I, I.
[9927.01s -> 9928.05s]  My size 13 feet.
[9930.05s -> 9931.01s]  Dude, I have a pair.
[9931.01s -> 9933.65s]  I have socks and I was trying to figure out why the fuck this happened.
[9933.65s -> 9934.05s]  I'm not kidding.
[9934.05s -> 9935.25s]  This is a real story.
[9935.25s -> 9940.61s]  Every single pair of socks that I own has a huge hole in both feet at the bottom.
[9940.61s -> 9942.74s]  And it's in the same exact spot.
[9942.74s -> 9945.14s]  And it's definitely because I bought like socks that were way too small.
[9945.14s -> 9947.18s]  That's ridiculous.
[9947.18s -> 9947.74s]  I can't believe it.
[9947.74s -> 9948.06s]  Yeah.
[9948.06s -> 9948.30s]  Yeah.
[9948.30s -> 9950.86s]  You might have to buy new socks, but you didn't win the bet.
[9950.86s -> 9956.50s]  So I thought, man, and you missed black Friday.
[9959.78s -> 9962.18s]  They don't make it in time, but are soaked in the storm.
[9962.82s -> 9964.26s]  But the tea house is dry.
[9964.82s -> 9971.58s]  The fragrant teas and later the mugs of mold whiskey are hot.
[9971.58s -> 9973.10s]  Hot whiskey is the thing.
[9973.10s -> 9973.58s]  Yeah.
[9973.58s -> 9974.46s]  Hot whiskey is amazing.
[9974.46s -> 9975.50s]  You never had it?
[9975.50s -> 9976.80s]  You've had, you've ever had hot whiskey?
[9976.80s -> 9977.44s]  Had some honey.
[9978.88s -> 9980.64s]  Do you actually, have you had it a lot before?
[9980.64s -> 9981.36s]  I haven't had it before.
[9983.01s -> 9984.53s]  I'm not speaking to you.
[9984.53s -> 9988.80s]  No, there's one more round.
[9988.80s -> 9991.36s]  It's something I have whenever I'm like, I catch a cold or something.
[9992.72s -> 9996.24s]  I mean, America has hot toddies, but I think they're a bit different in America.
[9996.24s -> 10000.00s]  But hot toddies and I don't think, I don't think in America when we get sick,
[10000.00s -> 10001.44s]  I don't think we drink alcohol.
[10001.44s -> 10004.64s]  Hot toddies like England Island is like whiskey with honey.
[10005.92s -> 10006.72s]  And that's like it.
[10006.72s -> 10007.28s]  And some lemon.
[10007.28s -> 10007.60s]  Really?
[10008.32s -> 10008.72s]  Yeah.
[10008.72s -> 10009.60s]  And it's really good.
[10010.08s -> 10011.28s]  That sounds pretty good.
[10013.01s -> 10013.73s]  Hot whiskey.
[10014.67s -> 10014.83s]  Yeah.
[10014.83s -> 10015.39s]  I've never had it.
[10015.39s -> 10016.83s]  I'm curious if you had it.
[10016.83s -> 10017.31s]  That's cool.
[10020.18s -> 10021.70s]  Thinking about something.
[10023.09s -> 10023.81s]  Just rain.
[10027.81s -> 10031.57s]  Rain and all these nine mystical phenomena that paint our lives.
[10031.57s -> 10035.65s]  That we try to explain into mundanity so we can take them for granted.
[10035.65s -> 10037.09s]  You don't know what rain is.
[10039.81s -> 10040.61s]  What's rain?
[10042.13s -> 10043.97s]  Rain, but also all this stuff.
[10044.93s -> 10048.42s]  I don't know.
[10048.42s -> 10050.18s]  Think back to our journey's beginning.
[10050.18s -> 10054.82s]  Fortune is the spur of the moment that strikes restless hearts and sparks an adventure.
[10055.38s -> 10057.30s]  Luck is the people you share it with.
[10058.18s -> 10060.99s]  If I didn't know the crap.
[10062.80s -> 10064.32s]  I'm not as drunk as you yet.
[10067.23s -> 10068.75s]  Just one more.
[10069.47s -> 10071.26s]  All right.
[10072.14s -> 10073.18s]  I thought that was a sandwich.
[10075.70s -> 10076.74s]  You feel like you're getting hungry?
[10077.38s -> 10078.58s]  Oh, you leveled up.
[10078.58s -> 10079.30s]  Nice.
[10079.30s -> 10080.50s]  Plus 10 more time and age.
[10080.50s -> 10081.22s]  Okay.
[10081.22s -> 10085.42s]  And then gets two extra armor.
[10087.33s -> 10089.09s]  And I might just take two extra armor.
[10089.82s -> 10092.86s]  Every other turn as a swift action and then sheds two of a foe's armor.
[10092.86s -> 10093.58s]  Now, let's do it.
[10093.58s -> 10094.86s]  I want to be tankier.
[10094.86s -> 10095.42s]  Let's do that.
[10100.21s -> 10100.37s]  Okay.
[10100.37s -> 10102.29s]  They're shifting over to the Mortha.
[10103.33s -> 10103.73s]  How is it?
[10103.73s -> 10104.77s]  Morthagy?
[10104.77s -> 10105.81s]  Morthaguy?
[10105.81s -> 10107.47s]  What are you?
[10107.47s -> 10108.19s]  What's going on, man?
[10109.97s -> 10111.33s]  Is he having a seizure?
[10111.33s -> 10112.13s]  No.
[10112.13s -> 10115.09s]  The name of the groups, like the Gorgons.
[10116.02s -> 10116.74s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[10116.74s -> 10117.46s]  I see what you're saying.
[10117.46s -> 10117.70s]  All right.
[10117.70s -> 10121.70s]  So you can see in Brandland as a recruit opportunity.
[10121.70s -> 10126.50s]  So if we had someone die or your character like had lost both his arms,
[10126.50s -> 10130.10s]  we could replace someone in our party and like recruit someone new.
[10130.10s -> 10132.90s]  If we recruit someone new, we would actually be the Fabulous Four.
[10133.62s -> 10134.02s]  We would.
[10134.02s -> 10135.86s]  But then it wouldn't be funny anymore.
[10135.86s -> 10136.58s]  I don't like that.
[10137.22s -> 10137.54s]  Yeah.
[10137.54s -> 10140.42s]  I think we should just like go past it and scout.
[10140.42s -> 10141.94s]  We're going to Dachia Forest.
[10144.00s -> 10144.48s]  Sounds good.
[10148.80s -> 10149.28s]  Dismiss.
[10150.08s -> 10151.28s]  Three more days remaining.
[10152.54s -> 10153.82s]  Oh, till the end.
[10153.82s -> 10154.46s]  Oh, no.
[10154.46s -> 10154.78s]  Great.
[10155.42s -> 10155.74s]  Okay.
[10156.54s -> 10157.52s]  Let's go.
[10158.24s -> 10162.83s]  What if we just wandered around for a bit?
[10163.78s -> 10165.14s]  Oh, event.
[10166.67s -> 10172.24s]  Oh, I have lost eyes, throwing them irretrievable upon the sea.
[10172.24s -> 10175.44s]  I have drowned my voice in those wailing waters.
[10176.16s -> 10177.84s]  Ochre at sunset.
[10177.84s -> 10181.04s]  The waves distance has washed my memories away.
[10182.24s -> 10187.70s]  I have seen the end, watched it come and watched it pass many times.
[10188.34s -> 10190.18s]  I know something of what lies ahead.
[10190.90s -> 10196.82s]  Along us and Thomas wait for Inon to come up the road,
[10196.82s -> 10198.90s]  taking shelter in an abandoned place.
[10198.90s -> 10201.46s]  They've chanced on another traveler.
[10203.22s -> 10206.30s]  That's a tantalizing crumb.
[10207.02s -> 10209.42s]  I don't want to do every single thing.
[10211.42s -> 10212.06s]  I was waiting.
[10212.06s -> 10213.26s]  I'm going to be the spooky lady.
[10213.26s -> 10215.82s]  I was hoping you were going to do all of them.
[10215.82s -> 10216.32s]  All right.
[10217.02s -> 10220.45s]  To someone who little knows the weight of knowledge, I am sure it appeals.
[10223.79s -> 10228.86s]  You must realize the only-
[10228.86s -> 10230.46s]  What has a star ever told me
[10230.46s -> 10231.82s]  that made me want less to know it?
[10233.10s -> 10235.50s]  Rain chatters on the thatch.
[10235.50s -> 10239.42s]  I see things written in the turning of storms,
[10239.42s -> 10242.22s]  in silver-wet letters and shaking pages of rain.
[10242.22s -> 10244.94s]  I read of dreams left behind this yondering.
[10244.94s -> 10247.52s]  I read of dooms the year is intent.
[10247.52s -> 10251.14s]  I read until my eyes shine and my stomach roars.
[10251.14s -> 10254.86s]  I have read of you.
[10255.42s -> 10258.59s]  I know what you are meant to be.
[10258.59s -> 10259.23s]  A dog.
[10259.23s -> 10260.83s]  You meant to be a full dog.
[10264.21s -> 10266.21s]  Not sure I believe in faute.
[10267.54s -> 10269.14s]  No one demands you believe.
[10269.14s -> 10274.83s]  You only must endure what happens.
[10274.83s -> 10277.71s]  The old storage building smells like ancient hay,
[10278.43s -> 10279.39s]  moist rock,
[10279.39s -> 10282.35s]  and the burning pine pitch of their torch.
[10282.35s -> 10287.23s]  The woman's robe moves like it's part of her.
[10287.23s -> 10288.35s]  She shrugs.
[10289.23s -> 10292.13s]  It's going to be really hard for me to continue
[10292.13s -> 10293.41s]  because I just looked over at my chat
[10293.41s -> 10295.17s]  and I just see Stewie being spammed
[10295.17s -> 10297.41s]  and it's like ruining everything.
[10297.41s -> 10299.65s]  Put the fingers together right now.
[10300.45s -> 10300.95s]  Fortunes.
[10303.46s -> 10304.98s]  I think you're doing a really good voice here.
[10304.98s -> 10306.90s]  Fortunes were given to crows to tell,
[10306.90s -> 10309.30s]  and crows were kind enough to share their gift with witches.
[10309.86s -> 10311.86s]  A witch, well paid,
[10311.86s -> 10314.10s]  shares fortunes with the way blind, Brian.
[10314.10s -> 10324.37s]  I'll give you my blood.
[10324.37s -> 10326.69s]  Wait, another transformation?
[10326.69s -> 10327.97s]  Another transformation.
[10327.97s -> 10328.47s]  For you?
[10329.18s -> 10330.22s]  Yeah, do it, man.
[10330.78s -> 10332.29s]  What are you going to turn into?
[10332.85s -> 10336.61s]  Then you have already glimpsed the form
[10336.61s -> 10338.69s]  your roving spirit must take.
[10338.69s -> 10340.29s]  You have seen it in your sleep
[10340.29s -> 10342.69s]  and it will not shatter you.
[10342.69s -> 10344.61s]  I dream that I don't see it.
[10344.61s -> 10347.25s]  I sort of insist on the different units.
[10347.25s -> 10350.67s]  You go winged but never flying.
[10350.67s -> 10352.51s]  Fast but rarely flinging.
[10352.51s -> 10360.51s]  Your wander leads you to things you never thought you chased.
[10360.51s -> 10361.47s]  Along us.
[10361.47s -> 10368.42s]  Thought we agreed I would be the one who you confided in.
[10368.42s -> 10369.54s]  The rain will pause.
[10369.54s -> 10370.50s]  I just ignore you.
[10370.50s -> 10371.00s]  Huh?
[10371.62s -> 10373.06s]  I just ignore Thomas.
[10373.06s -> 10374.34s]  I mean, I didn't even look at you.
[10376.78s -> 10378.78s]  The rain will pause in the morning.
[10378.78s -> 10379.90s]  Do not worry much,
[10379.90s -> 10381.10s]  for you will love yourself.
[10381.82s -> 10383.58s]  Lonelier though it may make you.
[10385.50s -> 10387.74s]  By the way, there was a queen in my dream last night.
[10388.70s -> 10391.07s]  In case that's important.
[10393.15s -> 10394.59s]  She halts momentarily.
[10394.59s -> 10399.63s]  The stillness of a startled bird.
[10399.63s -> 10402.59s]  Some dreams are only flights of fancy.
[10402.59s -> 10405.71s]  No, but like there was also a king and a castle
[10405.71s -> 10409.31s]  and there was these giant motorized vehicles with tires.
[10411.33s -> 10412.53s]  The night elapses.
[10412.53s -> 10416.74s]  The rain sounds like a river of dragonflies flowing by.
[10416.74s -> 10418.74s]  Snoring thunder is occasional and soft.
[10418.74s -> 10421.28s]  Growing ever more distant.
[10421.28s -> 10422.24s]  Along us.
[10422.24s -> 10423.12s]  And Thomas.
[10423.12s -> 10424.80s]  Sleep at some point.
[10424.80s -> 10425.68s]  Taking turns.
[10425.68s -> 10427.12s]  Am I just stuck out in the rain?
[10427.60s -> 10429.12s]  Yeah.
[10429.12s -> 10429.92s]  I think you're in the rain.
[10429.92s -> 10430.24s]  This is my life.
[10430.24s -> 10432.16s]  I'm such a disgusting loner.
[10432.16s -> 10435.62s]  The woman walks out into the pale predawn.
[10435.62s -> 10437.78s]  Without a sound or a pain.
[10437.78s -> 10443.65s]  Or any observed moment of metamorphosis.
[10443.65s -> 10445.66s]  Along us wakes up.
[10445.66s -> 10446.14s]  Boing.
[10446.14s -> 10449.02s]  You have crow wings on your back?
[10449.02s -> 10451.39s]  What's happening to you?
[10451.39s -> 10454.19s]  They'll continue on to word hero index.
[10455.95s -> 10457.39s]  Is that the name of a town?
[10457.39s -> 10458.51s]  It's a random town.
[10458.51s -> 10459.87s]  Yeah, they just randomly name them.
[10459.87s -> 10461.47s]  Word hero index.
[10462.11s -> 10463.71s]  Hey Thomas, there you are.
[10463.71s -> 10464.83s]  Along us with you.
[10464.83s -> 10465.79s]  Couldn't find you in the rain.
[10465.79s -> 10466.27s]  That's a camp.
[10466.27s -> 10468.53s]  What the fuck is out on your back?
[10468.53s -> 10471.55s]  I'm a bird dog.
[10471.55s -> 10472.05s]  Fight.
[10473.66s -> 10475.18s]  Time to dry out these wings.
[10475.18s -> 10477.02s]  So now you have wings.
[10477.02s -> 10481.66s]  Your character is so much cooler than all everything.
[10481.66s -> 10484.22s]  Thomas is just normal guy in a robe.
[10484.22s -> 10484.62s]  Yeah.
[10484.62s -> 10486.70s]  I'm like, I've got like a stone face.
[10486.70s -> 10488.70s]  And along us is like a winged wolf.
[10488.70s -> 10492.26s]  Can I get like laser eyes or something eventually here?
[10492.26s -> 10494.02s]  I don't think it does anything.
[10494.02s -> 10495.22s]  All right.
[10495.22s -> 10497.06s]  So maybe maybe increases your movement or something.
[10497.06s -> 10497.70s]  I don't know.
[10497.70s -> 10499.44s]  So what are we?
[10499.44s -> 10501.44s]  We've been attacked or something?
[10501.44s -> 10502.64s]  I kicked the door open.
[10502.64s -> 10503.20s]  Oh god.
[10503.20s -> 10504.08s]  Oh, okay.
[10504.08s -> 10510.43s]  I just walked back and forth like an idiot.
[10515.01s -> 10517.09s]  Does your sentinel trigger if they walk up to you?
[10517.09s -> 10518.37s]  Or they have to walk by?
[10518.37s -> 10520.69s]  If they move within two spaces, I'll run.
[10520.69s -> 10523.01s]  So if they move, I'll run into the building.
[10523.01s -> 10526.67s]  So if you want like a defense bonus to be next to Thomas.
[10526.67s -> 10529.20s]  All that.
[10534.11s -> 10534.61s]  Dogged.
[10536.75s -> 10537.25s]  Alarm.
[10537.79s -> 10541.49s]  Damn, you guys really just do.
[10541.49s -> 10542.45s]  You guys just crush.
[10543.01s -> 10547.33s]  Stormthroat bird?
[10548.13s -> 10549.49s]  What the fuck did you do to me?
[10553.50s -> 10555.50s]  One shred damage at the start of every turn.
[10556.22s -> 10560.77s]  Oh, wait, I can shoo the bird away.
[10560.77s -> 10561.33s]  My turn.
[10561.33s -> 10561.81s]  There we go.
[10562.85s -> 10564.29s]  I just smashed that.
[10565.09s -> 10566.29s]  There could have been a device in there.
[10566.29s -> 10567.97s]  There could have been like a weapon button.
[10573.58s -> 10574.46s]  I can't really get in there.
[10575.10s -> 10576.80s]  I can move.
[10576.80s -> 10579.71s]  Let's go up here.
[10580.35s -> 10581.97s]  Well, I think I need.
[10581.97s -> 10583.09s]  I guess I could take the axe out.
[10583.57s -> 10589.15s]  They're leaving you in the yard.
[10589.15s -> 10589.63s]  An alarm.
[10589.63s -> 10591.57s]  So I think something's gonna come.
[10591.57s -> 10592.21s]  They're not leaving.
[10592.21s -> 10594.45s]  Guys, I am like the casters support.
[10594.45s -> 10596.29s]  I am not supposed to be up there fighting.
[10596.29s -> 10600.77s]  I'm supposed to be back throwing fireballs at walls and collecting stones and stuff.
[10605.22s -> 10605.70s]  Oh, shit.
[10609.44s -> 10616.72s]  I will block his route to you.
[10616.72s -> 10618.64s]  Oh, that's so you don't want to be next to the bench.
[10621.90s -> 10622.94s]  You fool.
[10622.94s -> 10624.22s]  You what have you done?
[10626.67s -> 10636.53s]  Actually, I'm going in.
[10636.53s -> 10637.33s]  Oh, my God.
[10637.33s -> 10638.05s]  There's more than one.
[10638.05s -> 10638.29s]  All right.
[10638.29s -> 10640.93s]  I have to get in here because I can't target anything.
[10640.93s -> 10645.09s]  Hey, there's nothing in this room, guys.
[10645.73s -> 10647.09s]  You're just alone in there.
[10647.25s -> 10651.33s]  But plus 35 to Lona, I remember.
[10651.33s -> 10655.10s]  Oh, you guys go.
[10655.10s -> 10655.98s]  You guys got the easy.
[10656.54s -> 10657.66s]  Oh, good.
[10657.66s -> 10660.14s]  You talk about how much damage we do and then you just do the same damage.
[10661.02s -> 10663.90s]  Yeah, but I need a network to attack people.
[10664.62s -> 10665.18s]  Yeah, that's true.
[10665.18s -> 10666.62s]  You got like a big spider web going.
[10667.52s -> 10667.76s]  Yeah.
[10667.76s -> 10669.84s]  Well, my character is actually bottom tier.
[10669.84s -> 10671.36s]  You shaker of traction.
[10671.36s -> 10674.88s]  It's a new one that also contains a melee strike.
[10674.88s -> 10680.08s]  If they get too close, you can probably replace the axe with a melee one.
[10681.57s -> 10684.69s]  Yeah, I wonder because that's just spell.
[10684.69s -> 10686.21s]  Is it more spell damage than the wand?
[10686.21s -> 10688.53s]  Yeah, it gives you plus two spells.
[10688.53s -> 10691.25s]  I wonder if the spell damage like applies even if you're not using it.
[10691.25s -> 10691.73s]  I wonder.
[10692.29s -> 10692.85s]  We'll find out.
[10698.18s -> 10699.14s]  What's that over there?
[10708.37s -> 10709.73s]  Are you OK?
[10722.27s -> 10723.87s]  Swooping in like vultures.
[10723.87s -> 10724.83s]  They killed everyone.
[10724.83s -> 10726.11s]  My friends, my family.
[10729.28s -> 10732.32s]  I don't know why these aren't like voice dialogues.
[10732.32s -> 10735.28s]  He's I don't know why I was there.
[10735.28s -> 10737.04s]  And I've lost track of time.
[10737.04s -> 10739.12s]  Perhaps they meant to keep me as a meal.
[10741.52s -> 10743.68s]  I have no family to go back to.
[10743.68s -> 10744.56s]  I have nothing.
[10747.06s -> 10749.46s]  Don't force me back to that empty village.
[10749.46s -> 10750.82s]  Take me with you instead.
[10750.82s -> 10752.98s]  Let me seek your vengeance by your side.
[10755.79s -> 10758.85s]  OK, so we can either bring him with us
[10758.85s -> 10760.13s]  and cost two legacy points
[10760.13s -> 10761.89s]  and then we have a fourth character forever
[10761.89s -> 10763.17s]  that someone has to control.
[10763.17s -> 10766.69s]  I refuse or we can just turn him down
[10766.69s -> 10768.21s]  and leave him in the ruins of his village.
[10770.26s -> 10770.66s]  All right.
[10770.66s -> 10772.98s]  I mean, I guess it's been decided.
[10772.98s -> 10775.14s]  Revengeance will only eat away at you
[10775.86s -> 10777.94s]  and it's not a good reason to leave your home.
[10779.87s -> 10780.75s]  Maybe you're right.
[10782.43s -> 10783.71s]  Gave up so fast.
[10783.71s -> 10784.67s]  The end.
[10784.67s -> 10786.11s]  What a loser.
[10786.11s -> 10788.03s]  He's not cut out for this life.
[10788.03s -> 10788.59s]  He's not.
[10789.47s -> 10789.71s]  All right.
[10789.71s -> 10790.51s]  Should we find an item?
[10791.07s -> 10792.43s]  Wait, we don't have much time there, right?
[10792.43s -> 10792.91s]  Should we just?
[10792.91s -> 10793.63s]  We we're out.
[10793.63s -> 10795.71s]  Yeah, we have only like 295 days
[10795.71s -> 10798.03s]  before the world collapses or whatever happens.
[10798.91s -> 10800.83s]  We're just going to rush from town to town.
[10800.83s -> 10802.83s]  I have a wild suggestion.
[10802.83s -> 10806.66s]  OK, what if we just go to like the nicest town
[10806.66s -> 10811.47s]  and just hang out for 300 days to hang out with you anymore?
[10811.47s -> 10812.43s]  You're a crow wolf.
[10814.02s -> 10816.70s]  Everyone's afraid of you.
[10816.70s -> 10818.54s]  OK, I've got one.
[10819.98s -> 10821.50s]  What's your favorite fruit?
[10821.50s -> 10826.24s]  Never have a cliff cherry.
[10826.24s -> 10829.60s]  They're rare, but worth splurging on at least once in your life.
[10830.16s -> 10831.44s]  What's happening to Thomas's voice?
[10831.44s -> 10834.16s]  He's he didn't age like 20 years or something.
[10834.16s -> 10835.90s]  Oh, you did age 10 years.
[10835.90s -> 10838.62s]  Yeah, I mean, a little bit gray in your hair.
[10838.62s -> 10839.50s]  That's a little older.
[10839.50s -> 10839.74s]  Yeah.
[10839.74s -> 10839.98s]  All right.
[10839.98s -> 10840.38s]  Hold on.
[10840.94s -> 10841.50s]  I'll fix it.
[10843.39s -> 10844.67s]  Careful there.
[10844.67s -> 10848.34s]  Your fancy taste is showing.
[10848.34s -> 10849.70s]  Next up, a difficult one.
[10851.94s -> 10853.86s]  Favorite thing to fight.
[10853.86s -> 10856.90s]  What?
[10856.90s -> 10859.46s]  That's like asking my favorite rash.
[10862.85s -> 10863.97s]  Least favorite, then.
[10869.81s -> 10872.05s]  Is that because they're over the next hill?
[10872.05s -> 10878.11s]  It's the ick factor and even worse than frixel.
[10878.11s -> 10883.38s]  They don't taste bread and they're like walking diseases.
[10883.38s -> 10888.30s]  And here I am making a career.
[10889.18s -> 10893.18s]  I feel like you should start adding some crows to your.
[10893.18s -> 10896.78s]  You are really trying to get this callback for this role, by the way.
[10896.78s -> 10897.28s]  Yeah.
[10898.54s -> 10900.54s]  I wonder if the casting director is going to call you back.
[10900.54s -> 10907.50s]  This guy wants to be a dog so bad.
[10912.83s -> 10915.63s]  Sometimes I wonder if it's not too late to start over somewhere.
[10915.63s -> 10916.99s]  I wouldn't know realistically.
[10919.55s -> 10921.23s]  Why are we talking about our favorite foods?
[10922.46s -> 10924.22s]  Well, we appreciate that.
[10924.22s -> 10924.86s]  I turned it.
[10924.86s -> 10928.30s]  What's your favorite food into like my life doesn't mean anything anymore.
[10930.30s -> 10931.26s]  Maybe I can start over.
[10931.26s -> 10932.22s]  Maybe it's not too late.
[10933.42s -> 10934.46s]  Oh, Cliffberries.
[10935.34s -> 10936.86s]  I'm half wolf quarter bird.
[10937.98s -> 10938.94s]  What about you?
[10938.94s -> 10940.86s]  What keeps you on this mortal plane?
[10941.58s -> 10943.10s]  I can't last another day.
[10943.66s -> 10946.58s]  The opportunity to make history.
[10946.58s -> 10948.26s]  Honestly, the gear.
[10948.26s -> 10949.38s]  You mean other than you.
[10955.36s -> 10956.40s]  The face is too good.
[10956.40s -> 10958.56s]  I'm like rejecting you.
[10959.44s -> 10960.24s]  We're married.
[10960.24s -> 10961.04s]  And you're cringing.
[10961.04s -> 10962.08s]  You're visibly cringing.
[10962.08s -> 10964.08s]  Why are you cringing?
[10964.08s -> 10965.52s]  Yeah, he's doing like a wolf cringe.
[10966.32s -> 10968.00s]  You should not be cringing to this.
[10970.11s -> 10971.87s]  So many things, really.
[10971.95s -> 10973.95s]  That laughy form.
[10973.95s -> 10975.31s]  That dazzling smile.
[10975.31s -> 10977.31s]  The way you whisper my name before a fight.
[10979.23s -> 10980.75s]  Okay, I got to do that from now on.
[10980.75s -> 10983.14s]  That's not an answer.
[10983.14s -> 10984.90s]  That's random flattery.
[10984.90s -> 10989.22s]  He's just power game dude to whispering his name before a fight.
[10989.22s -> 10994.26s]  Plus, what kind of man would I be if I left you to get picked up by some beefy Gorgon?
[10994.26s -> 10998.96s]  I just said Gorgons are my least favorite enemy.
[11000.90s -> 11001.46s]  True.
[11001.46s -> 11002.18s]  Come hither.
[11002.18s -> 11003.62s]  Away from those tentacles.
[11004.48s -> 11005.52s]  And I'm toast.
[11005.52s -> 11007.65s]  Oh, wait, you're a hentai guy?
[11009.81s -> 11013.17s]  Thomas and Longus gain temporary damage and potency.
[11013.17s -> 11015.33s]  Dude, I'm going to be so low in the night.
[11017.41s -> 11019.65s]  Oh, Thomas.
[11019.65s -> 11026.64s]  Oh, get the squirrel.
[11026.64s -> 11027.28s]  Wait, are we?
[11027.28s -> 11027.76s]  Get the squirrel.
[11027.76s -> 11028.24s]  Check it out.
[11028.24s -> 11028.88s]  Get the squirrel.
[11029.52s -> 11029.84s]  Squirrel.
[11035.92s -> 11036.64s]  Where's the squirrel?
[11036.64s -> 11037.20s]  Get the squirrel.
[11037.20s -> 11038.00s]  We're ready to go.
[11038.00s -> 11038.88s]  Get the squirrel.
[11038.88s -> 11039.36s]  I need to...
[11041.38s -> 11044.50s]  Do you want a water crossbow or a water dueling sword?
[11044.50s -> 11047.70s]  Can we give you like water legs or something?
[11047.70s -> 11048.74s]  Can you transform again?
[11048.98s -> 11060.26s]  I feel like Thomas's side quest is going to be so mundane.
[11060.26s -> 11061.86s]  He's going to be like, hey, do you guys want to play Uno?
[11062.50s -> 11063.86s]  And then we just play Uno.
[11063.86s -> 11068.10s]  Well, yeah, wasn't your original side quest that you had, wasn't it?
[11068.10s -> 11070.27s]  Oh, let's play Dice for five minutes.
[11070.27s -> 11071.63s]  Yeah, yeah, it was.
[11072.19s -> 11077.70s]  Okay, you got Spineful, the water crossbow.
[11078.34s -> 11081.38s]  I renamed it to Doomsday of Doombow.
[11082.10s -> 11086.74s]  Interesting.
[11086.74s -> 11087.46s]  All right, using.
[11088.26s -> 11091.73s]  I'm about to die, by the way.
[11092.45s -> 11092.77s]  All right.
[11113.70s -> 11114.90s]  We're in the middle of a battle.
[11114.90s -> 11115.62s]  You need to focus.
[11120.45s -> 11121.41s]  Oh, my one eye.
[11123.01s -> 11123.89s]  Sorry, I got the bucket.
[11124.45s -> 11125.57s]  All right, I'm going to...
[11125.57s -> 11127.66s]  Oh, I can do Shackle.
[11132.90s -> 11133.22s]  Sick.
[11142.59s -> 11145.71s]  All right, I just heard these crow sounds.
[11145.71s -> 11147.87s]  I thought that was your character.
[11147.87s -> 11152.03s]  Oh, wait, if anything attacks Thomas, you get plus four damage.
[11152.03s -> 11152.43s]  Yeah.
[11152.43s -> 11152.83s]  Really?
[11153.55s -> 11155.23s]  Yeah, we've been over this.
[11155.55s -> 11156.43s]  Love is vengeance.
[11165.25s -> 11168.29s]  I think we're just rolling balls of infinite damage.
[11170.53s -> 11171.81s]  We're pretty strong, actually.
[11172.45s -> 11173.92s]  That's what I'm saying.
[11173.92s -> 11175.44s]  Like, let's just wait 300 days.
[11176.16s -> 11177.28s]  No, that would be...
[11177.28s -> 11177.76s]  Oh, oh.
[11178.56s -> 11182.67s]  I got him.
[11182.67s -> 11183.55s]  You got him?
[11183.55s -> 11189.70s]  Oh, my.
[11189.70s -> 11190.98s]  You killed him in one hit.
[11190.98s -> 11191.22s]  Nice.
[11191.78s -> 11193.22s]  I do have a really big habit.
[11193.78s -> 11197.44s]  Take this.
[11198.08s -> 11199.52s]  Time for the melee wand.
[11201.12s -> 11205.65s]  There we go.
[11205.65s -> 11213.07s]  Can I do this through walls?
[11213.07s -> 11213.95s]  Probably not.
[11213.95s -> 11215.23s]  That was a really stupid question.
[11217.94s -> 11219.62s]  No, you're not stupid.
[11219.62s -> 11220.26s]  Stupid, honey.
[11221.06s -> 11221.38s]  Thanks.
[11221.38s -> 11221.94s]  I appreciate it.
[11222.66s -> 11236.67s]  Dude, Thomas is falling behind.
[11238.53s -> 11238.93s]  I'm all right.
[11239.97s -> 11240.93s]  Another crit chance.
[11241.65s -> 11243.10s]  We all have a slot, right?
[11244.80s -> 11246.72s]  Yeah, it's going to take you past 20.
[11246.72s -> 11247.52s]  That's pretty good.
[11247.52s -> 11248.00s]  I'll take it.
[11248.72s -> 11252.35s]  It's not color, is it?
[11253.07s -> 11256.00s]  Because we know who that would have been for.
[11257.57s -> 11258.61s]  Do you remember...
[11258.61s -> 11259.89s]  Do people still do this in WoW?
[11260.61s -> 11262.85s]  I haven't really played it too intently or deeply,
[11262.85s -> 11264.29s]  but I remember back in the day,
[11265.65s -> 11268.37s]  everyone always agreed that you don't need...
[11268.53s -> 11270.37s]  You need, you know, greed, right?
[11270.37s -> 11271.09s]  If you don't need it,
[11271.09s -> 11272.53s]  you just greed it or you pass on it, right?
[11273.76s -> 11275.04s]  Is this those people in the five mans
[11275.04s -> 11277.28s]  that just need every single item?
[11277.28s -> 11278.00s]  This is...
[11278.00s -> 11279.28s]  You got a custom quest?
[11279.28s -> 11280.40s]  Yeah, this is what it is.
[11281.60s -> 11286.94s]  Thomas and Inon are called to a hill village
[11286.94s -> 11289.74s]  where an acquaintance of theirs has lost her wife.
[11291.15s -> 11293.55s]  After this rain comes, the farms will prosper again.
[11294.11s -> 11300.03s]  Not if there's no farmers left.
[11300.03s -> 11302.66s]  It's been a dry fall.
[11302.66s -> 11303.86s]  That's all I mean.
[11303.86s -> 11307.81s]  The funerary rites are brief.
[11307.81s -> 11309.57s]  The crowd that's gathered is impressive.
[11310.13s -> 11311.09s]  Such a small town.
[11313.31s -> 11314.91s]  As mourners disperse,
[11314.91s -> 11317.23s]  Thomas and Inon spot Baladchi
[11317.23s -> 11319.07s]  standing by a flower-strung cart
[11319.07s -> 11320.43s]  bearing a leaf-shrouded body.
[11321.23s -> 11325.36s]  Baladchi.
[11325.36s -> 11327.84s]  We're sorry to hear about Arthel.
[11327.84s -> 11329.36s]  Who are these people?
[11329.36s -> 11330.40s]  A lot of folks came.
[11336.42s -> 11337.38s]  Do we not...
[11337.38s -> 11339.14s]  Wait, have we been here before?
[11339.14s -> 11341.22s]  How many years has it been?
[11341.22s -> 11342.50s]  No, we haven't.
[11342.50s -> 11345.14s]  I think we walked through this place during the...
[11345.14s -> 11346.82s]  Up the road to her home on the hill.
[11346.82s -> 11351.25s]  Oh gee, you lose perspective sometimes.
[11351.25s -> 11353.25s]  Easy enough to do, sadly.
[11353.25s -> 11355.33s]  You think you all have years together.
[11355.33s -> 11356.29s]  Decades.
[11356.29s -> 11359.06s]  From your first hike to your middle years.
[11359.06s -> 11360.56s]  Old age.
[11360.56s -> 11361.81s]  Then.
[11361.81s -> 11364.35s]  And but...
[11364.35s -> 11365.84s]  Mickey Mouse?
[11365.84s -> 11366.00s]  Yeah.
[11366.00s -> 11369.28s]  To help Baladchi transfer the shrouded body
[11369.28s -> 11371.12s]  to a small prepared clay room
[11371.12s -> 11372.48s]  besides the house.
[11372.48s -> 11375.36s]  They settle inside
[11375.36s -> 11377.12s]  and she tells them of her plan.
[11377.12s -> 11379.76s]  One of the provincial customs she's observing.
[11379.76s -> 11383.34s]  Oh gee, Green Valley is called
[11383.34s -> 11385.34s]  a woven shrouded dawnshard.
[11385.42s -> 11388.24s]  Dawnshard grows thick around here.
[11388.24s -> 11390.08s]  In little woodlands you'll see
[11390.08s -> 11391.60s]  there's a strong aroma.
[11391.60s -> 11393.12s]  The body stays fresh
[11393.12s -> 11395.60s]  sometimes as long as four years or five.
[11395.60s -> 11399.84s]  By the way, you are just doing the other voice
[11400.48s -> 11402.32s]  but without the wolf on it.
[11404.35s -> 11406.03s]  Oh yeah, I'm just having a little bit of...
[11406.83s -> 11408.83s]  Just doing this one hair.
[11408.83s -> 11413.36s]  Keep hiking, man.
[11413.36s -> 11414.00s]  Keep it up.
[11414.00s -> 11420.29s]  We help folks genuinely build a wide shroud
[11420.29s -> 11433.44s]  as it means she'd be buried.
[11433.44s -> 11435.68s]  There's something very silencing in that.
[11435.68s -> 11440.02s]  I think it's a good tradition.
[11440.02s -> 11442.18s]  But I don't plan on waiting.
[11442.18s -> 11444.82s]  You don't?
[11444.82s -> 11446.50s]  Plan's a wait.
[11446.50s -> 11448.18s]  So you plan to bury her soon?
[11448.18s -> 11450.62s]  Tonight even?
[11450.62s -> 11451.68s]  No.
[11451.68s -> 11453.04s]  My wife, I already settled
[11453.04s -> 11454.80s]  and I will be going on a journey.
[11454.80s -> 11458.59s]  Hope you'd come along.
[11458.59s -> 11459.23s]  Brack.
[11459.23s -> 11467.90s]  Hard, sudden rain falls.
[11468.46s -> 11470.14s]  Chittering and droning like a swarm.
[11470.78s -> 11473.10s]  Is Andy what they're calling me over here?
[11473.10s -> 11473.74s]  Giving out advice?
[11475.09s -> 11475.65s]  What?
[11475.65s -> 11477.33s]  People calling me two-voice Andy
[11477.33s -> 11479.41s]  giving out vocal advice.
[11481.55s -> 11483.39s]  They're saying how I should not be giving you
[11483.95s -> 11486.19s]  voice tips because I have three voices.
[11486.19s -> 11488.58s]  I mean, you're going to criticize...
[11488.58s -> 11489.70s]  You're going to come at me
[11489.70s -> 11490.90s]  and I'm the one...
[11490.90s -> 11491.70s]  I'm doing it.
[11491.70s -> 11494.24s]  Would you like to take over?
[11494.24s -> 11494.74s]  Yeah.
[11498.96s -> 11500.00s]  Yes, I hope you'd come.
[11503.81s -> 11505.01s]  Be our escort.
[11505.01s -> 11506.82s]  It's a dangerous world.
[11506.82s -> 11507.94s]  And you're both strong.
[11507.94s -> 11508.44s]  Stronger than...
[11509.86s -> 11512.10s]  Stronger than I even remembered.
[11513.68s -> 11514.72s]  Stop doing that to me.
[11514.72s -> 11515.60s]  It's making me angry.
[11517.38s -> 11518.58s]  This doesn't represent me.
[11518.58s -> 11519.22s]  Oh, all right, fine.
[11519.22s -> 11520.26s]  Let's do stirr's voices.
[11522.26s -> 11523.54s]  I'll come along with you.
[11523.54s -> 11525.30s]  I'm going to get a little bit of protection.
[11525.94s -> 11526.98s]  Me too.
[11526.98s -> 11533.68s]  I have no idea what happened in that whole encounter.
[11534.48s -> 11535.76s]  It was apparently...
[11535.76s -> 11537.36s]  It's a friend of Thomas.
[11537.36s -> 11542.19s]  Her wife died and she asked us to escort the body in a wagon.
[11542.19s -> 11545.60s]  Just west of Nightgrave Threshery,
[11545.60s -> 11548.00s]  Baldashi leads her oxen cart,
[11548.00s -> 11551.12s]  carrying the body of her wife down through the hills
[11551.12s -> 11552.96s]  into the arms of an old forest.
[11553.70s -> 11556.18s]  Mist rolls in as twilight takes hold.
[11556.18s -> 11557.38s]  Behind a cloudy sky.
[11560.70s -> 11564.30s]  This forest was named Lagannet when it was on the maps.
[11564.30s -> 11565.58s]  Absent forest it meant.
[11566.54s -> 11567.82s]  It's not an encouraging name.
[11568.38s -> 11572.85s]  Can I ask about Arthel?
[11573.49s -> 11575.89s]  I don't think either of us have ever met her.
[11575.89s -> 11578.86s]  You missed your other character.
[11581.46s -> 11581.96s]  Place...
[11582.90s -> 11584.66s]  Place I'm...
[11585.86s -> 11586.66s]  Place I'm looking...
[11586.66s -> 11588.42s]  Place I'm looking for shouldn't be...
[11588.42s -> 11588.92s]  You do it.
[11590.94s -> 11598.03s]  I remember you talking about her.
[11598.03s -> 11605.20s]  Sleeping type.
[11605.20s -> 11608.90s]  Always wanted her to but she was never quiet and well enough.
[11608.90s -> 11612.26s]  And she insisted on staying home to tend the farm.
[11612.26s -> 11615.79s]  We met in the spring.
[11615.79s -> 11617.07s]  I remember clearly.
[11617.63s -> 11619.71s]  My grandma had just passed.
[11620.27s -> 11622.59s]  It sounds like Hubert from Family Guy.
[11624.11s -> 11632.70s]  Come here child.
[11632.70s -> 11634.14s]  Even when you're hurting.
[11634.14s -> 11636.86s]  We built the farm there on Lucky Hill.
[11636.86s -> 11642.83s]  She liked the farm, Arthel.
[11642.83s -> 11645.63s]  She was kind and humble woman child.
[11645.63s -> 11648.35s]  She was born with an illness that never fully left.
[11649.22s -> 11650.82s]  Our good times were great.
[11650.98s -> 11652.66s]  Doesn't look kind, humble, or shy.
[11652.66s -> 11655.22s]  She looks like she just beat up a child.
[11655.22s -> 11655.72s]  Yeah.
[11656.42s -> 11658.14s]  I like her both in on it too.
[11658.14s -> 11659.74s]  Like how fucking you got them.
[11659.74s -> 11660.62s]  All right.
[11660.62s -> 11663.23s]  But our bad times.
[11663.95s -> 11665.55s]  When she couldn't rise from bed.
[11666.11s -> 11668.35s]  Those made my heart splinter.
[11668.35s -> 11669.15s]  And one day.
[11669.95s -> 11670.93s]  It shattered.
[11671.81s -> 11677.02s]  And there's one thing I know is that I don't want to live in that empty house without her.
[11677.66s -> 11681.65s]  The forest had been dead quiet.
[11682.21s -> 11683.01s]  When they entered.
[11683.57s -> 11684.93s]  As they've gone deeper.
[11684.93s -> 11687.01s]  Noises have filtered into hearing.
[11687.01s -> 11687.89s]  Drips.
[11687.89s -> 11688.45s]  Scrapes.
[11689.01s -> 11689.73s]  No trills.
[11692.02s -> 11693.78s]  The smells have turned richer.
[11693.78s -> 11695.06s]  Of damp earth.
[11695.06s -> 11696.42s]  Spicy bark.
[11696.42s -> 11698.50s]  Quilted mosses in purple, green, and beige.
[11700.46s -> 11701.26s]  Soon.
[11701.26s -> 11702.46s]  The ox halts.
[11703.26s -> 11704.78s]  They come into a clearing.
[11704.78s -> 11705.82s]  Where a goddess lives.
[11707.02s -> 11707.52s]  Oh.
[11707.90s -> 11711.14s]  Glad she?
[11715.23s -> 11715.71s]  Yes.
[11715.71s -> 11717.15s]  I didn't find her.
[11717.15s -> 11719.47s]  The reason I thought Arthel was here.
[11719.47s -> 11720.75s]  The reason I'm here.
[11720.75s -> 11723.30s]  And you're here.
[11723.30s -> 11724.82s]  Arooey.
[11724.82s -> 11727.94s]  She's a goddess of borders and in-betweens.
[11727.94s -> 11730.82s]  This realm of hers welcomes both to death and living.
[11731.54s -> 11733.65s]  So I'm here to join her.
[11734.69s -> 11736.13s]  Slip my fucking throat.
[11738.64s -> 11739.60s]  Well actually.
[11739.60s -> 11740.72s]  You have to slow down.
[11740.72s -> 11744.00s]  Clearly this idea has been germinating for some time.
[11744.00s -> 11744.40s]  I don't know.
[11744.40s -> 11744.90s]  What?
[11745.20s -> 11749.31s]  Look it's this forest.
[11749.31s -> 11750.19s]  I read about it.
[11750.19s -> 11757.78s]  This goddess Arooey rules it like a region between our world and a place for the departed.
[11757.78s -> 11759.86s]  I suppose it exists for us.
[11759.94s -> 11761.22s]  For those like us.
[11761.86s -> 11764.34s]  A place Arthel can be without pain.
[11764.98s -> 11767.14s]  And I can be with Arthel.
[11768.18s -> 11774.35s]  But isn't it just like dying yourself?
[11774.99s -> 11777.23s]  Crossing over to be together?
[11777.23s -> 11781.55s]  We'll be able to leave this place.
[11781.55s -> 11785.09s]  But why would she still live?
[11785.73s -> 11786.86s]  She will too.
[11786.86s -> 11788.14s]  We'll just live here.
[11788.14s -> 11792.86s]  You have to understand this is what I want.
[11792.86s -> 11797.66s]  All I need for you is to help me complete the ceremony and take the Bohoroks back with you.
[11799.28s -> 11803.04s]  I did not expect this character was going to have this much dialogue for you to do.
[11804.64s -> 11806.64s]  You are monologuing as this.
[11808.96s -> 11812.96s]  Okay.
[11812.96s -> 11813.60s]  All right.
[11813.60s -> 11820.68s]  Okay.
[11821.78s -> 11822.90s]  This is your choice.
[11825.60s -> 11830.08s]  I mean we can't just throw your life behind.
[11830.64s -> 11832.16s]  No we can't.
[11834.08s -> 11834.58s]  We can't.
[11835.20s -> 11839.26s]  What do you mean you can't let me?
[11842.22s -> 11846.22s]  We're not in the business of letting friends die by any name.
[11846.22s -> 11847.74s]  By their choice or not.
[11847.74s -> 11849.66s]  I know you feel this is the only way.
[11849.66s -> 11853.52s]  But why?
[11853.52s -> 11855.28s]  What proof do you have that it'll work?
[11855.84s -> 11858.56s]  Do you think this goddess will demand nothing else from you?
[11866.75s -> 11868.75s]  You're not doing this today.
[11868.75s -> 11871.62s]  That's a starting point isn't it?
[11871.62s -> 11872.74s]  All that matters is today.
[11876.13s -> 11881.15s]  Silent minutes slip by.
[11881.15s -> 11884.35s]  They pass without motion save for the roll of mist.
[11884.35s -> 11886.03s]  The blink of damp eyelids.
[11886.03s -> 11887.63s]  The fall of silver-struck tears.
[11888.37s -> 11895.92s]  Finally Baladji raises her head and addresses the shrine at her back.
[11895.92s -> 11898.24s]  Dear goddess I'm sorry.
[11898.24s -> 11901.92s]  Today I'll leave your wood to your own.
[11901.92s -> 11905.12s]  Let me be back.
[11905.12s -> 11908.43s]  They turn the ox around.
[11909.07s -> 11918.26s]  But surprising and slow a low long stretch sound coils from the stones.
[11918.26s -> 11919.22s]  The roots.
[11919.22s -> 11919.78s]  The earth.
[11920.50s -> 11922.45s]  Baladji?
[11922.45s -> 11924.08s]  I don't know.
[11924.16s -> 11929.82s]  As it speaks something huge crashes through the trees.
[11933.81s -> 11934.05s]  What?
[11935.66s -> 11936.94s]  Please stay.
[11936.94s -> 11938.54s]  It's a retainer of the old god.
[11940.80s -> 11941.84s]  It's gonna kill us man.
[11941.84s -> 11943.68s]  It's gonna keep us here and we're gonna die.
[11943.68s -> 11945.36s]  So wait this is what is this thing?
[11945.36s -> 11946.24s]  What what is this thing?
[11947.12s -> 11952.24s]  It's I don't know the stones that were part of the shrine came to life and it demanded that we stay.
[11952.96s -> 11954.72s]  So I think it's trying to kill us.
[11954.72s -> 11955.92s]  Oh shit all right.
[11957.79s -> 11958.29s]  Let's go.
[11962.03s -> 11964.03s]  The wizard runs at the giant beast.
[11965.07s -> 11965.71s]  Stick in hand.
[11967.26s -> 11968.94s]  Oh he's gonna kill me.
[11968.94s -> 11970.14s]  He's gonna I'm getting out of here.
[11970.14s -> 11970.70s]  I'm getting out of here.
[11976.29s -> 11978.69s]  Jesus Christ.
[11978.69s -> 11982.05s]  My turn from the shadows.
[11982.05s -> 11983.42s]  All right.
[11983.42s -> 11984.30s]  Love is vengeance.
[11985.70s -> 11990.26s]  I'm just imagining somebody during this screaming Jesus Christ.
[11991.78s -> 11992.74s]  You're wearing different.
[11992.74s -> 11993.62s]  I don't know the villain is.
[11996.02s -> 11997.54s]  They leave the forest.
[11997.54s -> 11998.98s]  I can't with this fucking segment.
[12002.24s -> 12003.52s]  The last light lingers.
[12004.00s -> 12005.20s]  This time of year.
[12005.76s -> 12007.36s]  This is your side quest by the way.
[12007.36s -> 12009.12s]  It's not even been about you owl.
[12009.12s -> 12011.76s]  You think we upset her the goddess.
[12014.58s -> 12016.02s]  Gods aren't like us.
[12016.02s -> 12017.70s]  The judgment isn't easy to sway.
[12017.70s -> 12020.02s]  But they do accept appeasement.
[12020.02s -> 12021.54s]  Speaking from all our red anyway.
[12022.10s -> 12026.40s]  It's a thoughtful journey back to the farm.
[12026.40s -> 12028.48s]  Belatia and Othell once built.
[12028.48s -> 12032.72s]  At least one of us should be getting back.
[12032.72s -> 12033.92s]  But one of us could stay.
[12034.56s -> 12038.51s]  Belatia seems to be developing a habit.
[12038.51s -> 12039.71s]  Oh you want to be in the right now?
[12039.71s -> 12040.83s]  No I'm desperate.
[12041.31s -> 12042.51s]  I thought it was her talking.
[12042.51s -> 12044.35s]  No you interjected and now you must leave.
[12045.95s -> 12048.99s]  Seems to be developing a habit for silence.
[12048.99s -> 12050.43s]  But then she sighs.
[12051.71s -> 12053.47s]  I think I will bury her.
[12055.87s -> 12057.15s]  I mean I mean come on.
[12057.79s -> 12061.14s]  I'm trying myself and slaying the god beast.
[12061.14s -> 12063.06s]  I think I might just bury her.
[12065.17s -> 12066.37s]  I'm grateful to you.
[12066.37s -> 12070.29s]  I'll keep in touch and oh well what can I really promise.
[12071.01s -> 12076.75s]  And so you guys leave.
[12078.27s -> 12081.15s]  She returns to her normal life and buries her loved one.
[12081.15s -> 12081.47s]  Okay.
[12085.66s -> 12090.06s]  Oh it's hard to let the good things go.
[12091.60s -> 12097.17s]  Yeah wishes come true but not always forever.
[12097.17s -> 12099.33s]  Friends are useful then I guess.
[12099.33s -> 12101.81s]  They pull you along when you just want to lie down in the road.
[12104.82s -> 12107.30s]  Oh along us wherever you are.
[12107.30s -> 12109.46s]  Maybe time to start looking into immortality.
[12111.06s -> 12112.10s]  The wind picks up.
[12112.66s -> 12114.26s]  They take their time returning home.
[12116.94s -> 12118.94s]  Oh we get some fucking hotwood.
[12118.94s -> 12119.74s]  We took our clothes.
[12120.70s -> 12122.06s]  We got some heartwood.
[12122.06s -> 12123.42s]  Thomas leveled up.
[12123.42s -> 12126.40s]  Oh I did all right.
[12126.40s -> 12131.14s]  Oh I'm not doing that.
[12132.13s -> 12133.65s]  Maybe naturalist.
[12133.65s -> 12136.82s]  You could re-roll these if they're kind of weak.
[12136.82s -> 12138.10s]  Oh infuse ranging.
[12138.10s -> 12139.84s]  Actually I like this.
[12139.84s -> 12142.64s]  That's I feel like I'm a little too far away sometimes.
[12142.64s -> 12144.29s]  Yeah I like that.
[12146.69s -> 12149.23s]  Let's head to Mist and Timberland then.
[12149.23s -> 12149.71s]  Push on.
[12151.55s -> 12152.59s]  We move on.
[12152.59s -> 12154.61s]  We press on.
[12154.61s -> 12162.22s]  By the way when I was I kind of had a moment back there.
[12162.22s -> 12163.50s]  When I was giving you shit bro.
[12163.50s -> 12165.42s]  Doing every voice like this.
[12166.30s -> 12168.78s]  Everybody in my chat was saying what about like Goku?
[12168.78s -> 12169.66s]  And if you don't know.
[12169.66s -> 12170.54s]  I do that too.
[12170.54s -> 12171.82s]  Everybody talks like this.
[12171.82s -> 12173.58s]  Everybody sounds like Mr Satan.
[12173.58s -> 12175.74s]  I just do a variation of that so I'm full of shit.
[12177.44s -> 12179.74s]  Everyone has two voices.
[12179.74s -> 12181.10s]  Yeah every yeah guys.
[12181.10s -> 12183.02s]  Everyone has two voices.
[12183.02s -> 12199.25s]  Well rumors of Gorgons have led the Bastion the Fabulous Four
[12199.25s -> 12202.61s]  through tangled woods to the side of a long forgotten roof.
[12203.33s -> 12208.29s]  Windborn rock and decayed edifices are all that remain of this ancient city.
[12208.29s -> 12212.83s]  Even the locals don't know who used to live here.
[12213.39s -> 12216.37s]  Petrified rat over here.
[12216.37s -> 12218.05s]  Nice of them to leave us a trail.
[12218.05s -> 12222.75s]  I wonder what lured them all the way out here.
[12222.75s -> 12226.19s]  Their trail was direct.
[12226.83s -> 12227.47s]  Calculated.
[12228.11s -> 12229.39s]  Might mean to stay.
[12229.39s -> 12231.39s]  Wouldn't be hard to make a place defensible.
[12231.39s -> 12232.99s]  The stoneworks set in good condition.
[12236.69s -> 12238.37s]  I forgot that your character looked like that.
[12238.37s -> 12239.09s]  It's been so long.
[12239.73s -> 12241.09s]  I jump out of the bushes.
[12241.09s -> 12245.41s]  One civilization falls another is built on the bones of their dead.
[12247.26s -> 12247.74s]  The dead.
[12248.38s -> 12254.82s]  Sometimes it's easy to forget they were real people.
[12254.82s -> 12255.78s]  Ordinary.
[12255.78s -> 12256.34s]  Most of them.
[12256.90s -> 12257.62s]  Probably.
[12257.62s -> 12262.35s]  Because you're a narcissist.
[12262.35s -> 12267.23s]  You know with all the usual hopes and fears and everyday concerns.
[12267.23s -> 12278.08s]  Thousands of feet must have trodden these streets every day exchanging goods and information.
[12278.08s -> 12281.41s]  And those must have been houses.
[12281.41s -> 12284.93s]  Not too fancy but the space a man calls his own.
[12284.93s -> 12286.37s]  I'm just you've been doing that.
[12286.37s -> 12287.73s]  I'm doing your voice now.
[12287.73s -> 12289.65s]  The space a man calls his own doesn't have to be.
[12294.30s -> 12295.26s]  Maybe we switch.
[12295.26s -> 12297.02s]  Like we've been married so long.
[12297.02s -> 12297.74s]  Okay let's switch it up.
[12299.20s -> 12301.36s]  You've given it a lot of thought love.
[12301.36s -> 12304.88s]  Wonder what kind of lives we could have lived if we'd settled in a place like this.
[12312.19s -> 12314.51s]  In the open pit of an old amphitheater.
[12314.51s -> 12316.11s]  Gorgon beast Bray and Mill.
[12317.06s -> 12317.78s]  Whoops.
[12317.78s -> 12319.06s]  Did we just walk in.
[12319.78s -> 12324.35s]  There are a bunch of them standing under that filler.
[12324.35s -> 12325.55s]  How about I bring it down.
[12326.27s -> 12330.32s]  Fire create confusion and the smoke will provide cover.
[12330.32s -> 12333.50s]  I'm an intimidation guy.
[12333.50s -> 12334.00s]  Yeah.
[12344.64s -> 12348.16s]  They've worked.
[12348.16s -> 12349.68s]  All enemies suffer two damage.
[12352.42s -> 12353.22s]  Oh nice all right.
[12357.10s -> 12359.65s]  Yeah where is everybody?
[12360.21s -> 12362.59s]  Oh they're up top.
[12362.59s -> 12371.55s]  Reveled.
[12371.55s -> 12372.19s]  Ooh howl.
[12384.27s -> 12386.19s]  What the fuck is your name again along us?
[12387.18s -> 12388.70s]  Along us baloney.
[12388.70s -> 12391.42s]  Is your name it's like a bug us but along us.
[12391.42s -> 12393.34s]  Is your name actually along us baloney?
[12393.90s -> 12396.96s]  Yeah no isn't it along us bolognese.
[12400.46s -> 12407.02s]  I feel like I feel like you wrote that in for like president at like an election.
[12407.02s -> 12409.98s]  Like I know I'm gonna vote for our longest baloney.
[12409.98s -> 12411.90s]  That's who I'm voting for this year.
[12411.90s -> 12416.56s]  I hit random and it was lungus and I had to change it to a lungus.
[12418.67s -> 12428.29s]  It just had to.
[12428.29s -> 12429.41s]  All right I'm close enough now.
[12429.49s -> 12430.77s]  We're pretty strong guys.
[12430.77s -> 12432.21s]  We actually are very strong.
[12432.21s -> 12433.30s]  It's pretty sick.
[12437.76s -> 12439.70s]  Oh watch out now.
[12441.78s -> 12443.78s]  What it didn't hit anybody.
[12451.81s -> 12453.73s]  Yeah one of my level ups was just plus two armor.
[12456.53s -> 12458.05s]  Yeah you're taking all these.
[12458.05s -> 12469.57s]  Here we go.
[12469.57s -> 12471.73s]  That's what I wanted to have happen last time.
[12471.73s -> 12475.52s]  I can kill that one.
[12475.52s -> 12482.93s]  I have a plan.
[12488.70s -> 12492.91s]  Wait I thought it bumped into the other one damn.
[12493.79s -> 12495.47s]  Oh was it was it one tile back further?
[12496.27s -> 12498.21s]  Yeah he's running.
[12501.89s -> 12502.53s]  Destroyed.
[12504.00s -> 12505.52s]  You activated my trap card.
[12507.58s -> 12508.78s]  We got level up.
[12508.78s -> 12510.85s]  Oh we do for a lungus.
[12511.41s -> 12512.93s]  Yeah it's a lungus bolognese.
[12512.93s -> 12513.65s]  That's your name.
[12514.45s -> 12515.97s]  Wait you can learn to fly now?
[12517.97s -> 12521.79s]  Swift action and 25 dodge.
[12527.49s -> 12529.49s]  Like you could do melee for your rapier.
[12530.37s -> 12533.68s]  Dude that whole battle you just threw some rocks.
[12535.14s -> 12539.22s]  Damage I mean I got the bite and the claw and the ring of rhythm.
[12541.41s -> 12543.33s]  Either of you two upgrades your speed.
[12543.33s -> 12544.05s]  Mine.
[12544.05s -> 12544.77s]  You should take it yeah.
[12545.49s -> 12546.29s]  All right let me get this straight.
[12546.29s -> 12547.97s]  People saying that all I did was throw rocks at people.
[12547.97s -> 12551.81s]  Um you don't think it'd be impressive if somebody broke up a pillar.
[12551.81s -> 12555.65s]  Turned it into three with their mind turned into three different discs.
[12555.65s -> 12559.20s]  And they flew out and homing missile hit three different enemies in the head.
[12559.20s -> 12561.60s]  Sorry I didn't um cast a lightning bolt out of my hands.
[12564.40s -> 12566.96s]  As they're breathing stills they hear the chittering of birds.
[12566.96s -> 12570.08s]  The buzz of bees overgrown grasses rustle in the breeze.
[12571.55s -> 12572.11s]  That rhymed.
[12574.85s -> 12575.89s]  Gone quiet.
[12575.89s -> 12579.58s]  Guess that was the last of them.
[12579.58s -> 12581.58s]  We should be sure before we move on.
[12581.90s -> 12583.66s]  Ancient settlement like this.
[12583.66s -> 12585.26s]  There's bound to be some hiding places.
[12587.60s -> 12590.96s]  Not far from where they fought a section of the flagstone appears to be coming up.
[12592.40s -> 12594.88s]  Thomas prized some away with his toe.
[12596.64s -> 12599.20s]  Uncovering what appears to be a way below.
[12599.20s -> 12600.80s]  Oh I'm moving with my.
[12600.80s -> 12602.72s]  Large and muscular toe there Thomas.
[12603.52s -> 12606.32s]  With a little more effort they widen out an entrance.
[12607.86s -> 12608.66s]  How deep is it?
[12609.30s -> 12610.42s]  Oh I was in the zone.
[12611.22s -> 12612.10s]  How deep is it?
[12613.55s -> 12613.95s]  Stairs.
[12615.04s -> 12616.00s]  These stairs go down.
[12618.56s -> 12620.24s]  Gotta check it out right?
[12620.24s -> 12621.92s]  Any good reason not to?
[12624.32s -> 12626.88s]  Down they climb into the ancient city's underbelly.
[12626.88s -> 12629.12s]  Slimy things skitter away at their approach.
[12629.12s -> 12631.36s]  A rancid odor hangs in the air.
[12634.98s -> 12636.26s]  Torch over here let me just.
[12638.64s -> 12642.16s]  In a splash of light their surroundings take color and shape.
[12642.16s -> 12644.80s]  The passage opens up to a small enclosure.
[12644.80s -> 12646.16s]  An oval room.
[12647.12s -> 12652.11s]  Bits of the rotted wood and matted straw form the pale suggestion of a bed at one end.
[12652.83s -> 12654.35s]  Oh smells doesn't it?
[12657.94s -> 12662.58s]  I was expecting a crypt or storehouse not somebody's dusty old bed chamber.
[12663.30s -> 12667.22s]  Wonder why they're here beneath the city.
[12668.02s -> 12674.67s]  Scattered around the room are what remain of a life's possessions.
[12674.67s -> 12677.87s]  Most are decayed or moth eaten beyond recognition.
[12678.51s -> 12681.31s]  That's a garment of some kind.
[12681.31s -> 12682.42s]  Clay fragments.
[12683.06s -> 12684.26s]  Pottery pieces.
[12684.26s -> 12685.38s]  I see something over here too.
[12686.34s -> 12690.02s]  If the Gorgons found this place I'm guessing they didn't see anything worth taking.
[12692.16s -> 12694.64s]  I can't tell if you gave up on switching.
[12694.64s -> 12695.20s]  I kind of did.
[12695.20s -> 12697.44s]  He's just slightly older so there's like a gruffness to it.
[12697.44s -> 12700.08s]  Well no we switched so he switched to the dog did it for like.
[12700.08s -> 12701.76s]  Yeah but now he switched back he switched back.
[12701.76s -> 12705.44s]  He was like wait a second like this isn't fun to do for like four hours.
[12705.44s -> 12707.44s]  Yeah I came to that conclusion pretty quickly.
[12707.44s -> 12710.88s]  Yeah yeah like anyone would any sane person would come to that conclusion.
[12710.88s -> 12716.11s]  It's mental but there's one item that catches Thomas's eye.
[12716.11s -> 12718.91s]  A small bone flute sat atop a stone pedestal.
[12718.91s -> 12722.51s]  Alone it seems like to have survived the passage of years unmarred.
[12725.42s -> 12730.62s]  Moon colored its surface is smooth polished by the press of ancient fingertips.
[12730.62s -> 12732.38s]  It begs to be held again.
[12734.75s -> 12736.19s]  There's a look I know well.
[12740.22s -> 12740.78s]  Oh I.
[12743.02s -> 12744.94s]  This thing it's in one piece at least.
[12745.42s -> 12748.94s]  Not that it's anything special it sort of catches my attention.
[12749.50s -> 12755.73s]  I can't help wondering what it sounded like who played it and who listened.
[12758.53s -> 12762.61s]  The way it's placed I think it was treasured by the hands that held it.
[12762.61s -> 12763.49s]  Well looked after.
[12765.09s -> 12770.74s]  He you're taking the flute we know you're taking the flute.
[12770.74s -> 12770.98s]  Yep.
[12773.89s -> 12776.21s]  Oh plus 15 charisma.
[12776.21s -> 12778.16s]  I'll take it.
[12778.16s -> 12779.10s]  Yeah.
[12779.10s -> 12785.71s]  Hell yeah.
[12785.71s -> 12787.52s]  Nice bone flute.
[12787.52s -> 12790.24s]  Thomas moves forward and carefully plucks the flute from its stand.
[12793.09s -> 12795.89s]  It's not doing anything down here except gathering dust.
[12795.89s -> 12798.85s]  Those who made it you think they'd want that.
[12802.72s -> 12807.12s]  That's like an heirloom writing a way to be remembered for whoever left it behind.
[12807.68s -> 12810.69s]  So if you want my opinion nothing is good.
[12811.33s -> 12819.02s]  They put out the torch make their way back to the surface and seal the passage behind them.
[12819.02s -> 12823.92s]  So how about a little contest find out who plays best.
[12824.48s -> 12826.24s]  You can't even play it with the wolf mouth.
[12830.34s -> 12831.54s]  Yeah how would you play that.
[12832.18s -> 12834.82s]  Damn it damn these wolf lips.
[12834.82s -> 12840.66s]  And then I stand up there and I'm like and then we all know who won.
[12840.66s -> 12842.29s]  All right let's build a bridge.
[12843.01s -> 12853.15s]  How many more days 280 285 days.
[12853.15s -> 12860.98s]  I'm telling you dude I'm telling you man we need to just like hang out at the bar for like two years.
[12860.98s -> 12866.61s]  No way man look I think this is the thing we're all we need to get to the altar yeah.
[12866.61s -> 12868.21s]  Yeah we're nearly there.
[12868.21s -> 12872.91s]  Okay well then we get to the altar and then we like camp out it's like we have tickets first.
[12873.39s -> 12878.48s]  Somebody said I hope something bad happens to your character so it's more interesting.
[12882.16s -> 12886.24s]  Yeah your character has gone relatively untouched by anything.
[12886.24s -> 12890.48s]  I'm just sort of a normal guy that just is like kind of here hanging out with my spells.
[12890.48s -> 12895.14s]  Okay what difficulties five should we patrol or should we just go for it.
[12895.14s -> 12898.14s]  What do you I think we go for it.
[12898.14s -> 12901.10s]  Just go just we're slamming right we cannot be stopped.
[12901.74s -> 12905.90s]  This is the final fight of the chapter when this fight is over the chat will end make sure you are
[12905.90s -> 12915.74s]  ready let's go oh let's do it normal guy and his furry wolf husband look at this
[12920.74s -> 12927.94s]  have we decided who gets the spear yet a towering reeking of algae and old water it stalks sedately
[12927.94s -> 12935.60s]  on its stony limbs while the world quakes it's called the calabine as 22 health is immune to
[12935.60s -> 12941.60s]  compulsion it crushes any scenery it touches yeah we are not whatever you're sweeping attacks
[12941.60s -> 12948.94s]  wait you're not on the map no we're we're on like a whole like we're still reading oh I skipped that
[12948.94s -> 12956.34s]  entirely for some reason I never got the reading oh we're like we're at the door I'm gonna watch
[12956.34s -> 12963.31s]  I'll watch yours oh I just I just joined oh my goodness this thing is huge 22 health and we're
[12963.39s -> 12977.79s]  gonna kill in one turn all right I need to get in here so I can I can fuse let me fuse with this
[12977.79s -> 12987.25s]  he's such a good infusion I'm biting oh uh-oh uh can you back up sir no I can't I've already
[12987.25s -> 13004.67s]  attacked okay oh I'm just let him on fire okay we're getting a divorce oh going right next to
[13004.67s -> 13018.70s]  the other one I did say if you could move and you went like oh I love his vengeance
[13018.78s -> 13025.82s]  all part of the plan all right let's get what we came for right don't you wonder what that
[13025.82s -> 13034.91s]  thing live down there there in the chamber is clear and almost sweet the corpse of the great
[13034.91s -> 13041.94s]  guardian shrivels inside its carapace it on approaches the edifice the spear is glass like
[13041.94s -> 13049.52s]  grand it radiates legacy and power it's just strange what could this thing really mean to them
[13051.73s -> 13058.32s]  the boars are in a normal heirloom my guess is that the hero queen who wielded this lance in
[13058.32s -> 13067.10s]  antiquity was actually a gargon so it's kind of an emblem to them maybe of a past hero
[13067.90s -> 13074.83s]  as in and grips the spear a noise begins to grow in the outer tunnels it's the noise of feet and
[13074.83s -> 13082.85s]  hooves of tortured lungs shoveling air and the slickering squelch of scraping things water
[13083.95s -> 13090.05s]  the sound of it a horde of gorgon beasts is pouring towards the chamber
[13090.05s -> 13095.52s]  are you crying if the story was not that moving
[13097.76s -> 13101.68s]  we need to hope they don't call for escape i don't think we'll survive if we stay here
[13104.24s -> 13112.46s]  holy shit look at that thing eight damage great spin i do have an empty slot that thing looks
[13112.46s -> 13123.84s]  pretty great i should take it oh where are they where are they coming from escape the gorgons
[13124.48s -> 13132.00s]  oh we got a whole cave is there a whole cave here yeah back back the other way oh there's a
[13132.00s -> 13142.72s]  door down here what did we just find if you xp we could but you're not a gamer so you don't want
[13142.72s -> 13150.61s]  to do that i need to get my gear score up for the dragon's expansion what do you even know
[13150.61s -> 13154.77s]  about gear score what do you even know about eye level tell me i have to get my light level

[13382.56s -> 13384.24s]  wait you might be okay i think he's blocking
[13387.47s -> 13398.77s]  no thomas back on his heels pain doesn't come immediately but the wet stuff dripping down his
[13398.77s -> 13404.61s]  face is probably blood he's never taken a hit like this at least not one that he can remember
[13405.57s -> 13409.60s]  you're gonna use minus 10 retirement age but that's that's not that bad
[13410.32s -> 13416.96s]  focus on surviving nothing more i can do maybe i'll get an interesting character
[13417.60s -> 13425.17s]  character edition if i do this he runs hope for the bow could be won without him maybe i'll lose
[13425.17s -> 13432.21s]  my nose or maybe i'll lose my lose up to my hair alone he staunches his wounds one gash
[13432.77s -> 13439.81s]  particularly deep that's gonna leave a scar a character defining scar character defining
[13439.81s -> 13457.18s]  scar let's go uh you have to make it out too though i'm gonna make it man come on you can do
[13457.18s -> 13467.15s]  it you're not not much further a wound if i go down it might be game over oh shit oh this actually is
[13467.15s -> 13471.68s]  bad i don't understand you just walk to the exit
[13478.22s -> 13485.18s]  oh no he sees the shadow of his foe he knows what's coming he can lean a little to one side
[13485.18s -> 13493.01s]  or the other but it won't change much he feels something a heaviness in his hand it has a name
[13493.81s -> 13499.25s]  the petri glass sea spear there's a story maybe that it wants to tell
[13500.69s -> 13509.74s]  and only a sliver of opportunity left to tell it i can choose to break the spear or take
[13509.74s -> 13515.34s]  minus two health for the rest of the campaign the like main quest item and then don't we need that
[13515.34s -> 13524.70s]  thing i will take the the health indecision grips him the blow lance he tumbles to the ground
[13524.70s -> 13529.66s]  gravely wounded and clutching his weapon in the end he couldn't choose to part with it even if
[13529.66s -> 13537.89s]  it meant paying the price himself oh no star you have fucked us i what have you done he has just
[13537.89s -> 13542.13s]  enough strength to retreat and we'll spend the next days tending to his wounds over your head
[13542.13s -> 13547.65s]  propped up at his bedside petri glass sea spear will wait until he's ready to take it up again
[13547.65s -> 13560.40s]  and let it sing wait what happened victory dude look at the scar on my eye let's salvage this we
[13560.40s -> 13565.95s]  don't need it it's just a yeah good you were good scar i don't think anyone needs this
[13566.67s -> 13574.85s]  all right mystic there it is see now i get to talk like this the rest of the campaign you pull up
[13574.85s -> 13581.76s]  look at your scar yeah once per turn you can pull a mote of heat out of the air and create fire
[13581.76s -> 13590.51s]  anyway you want i'm doing that one what's mine i don't care i don't give a shit anymore i don't
[13590.51s -> 13607.34s]  fucking care this has to be you're the only one alive it's done oh we all of us together left
[13607.34s -> 13616.22s]  that canyon and cave behind the enemy's treasure in our hands it almost broke we should be joyful
[13617.58s -> 13626.40s]  but we know a clash is coming my books claim wars are one piece by piece trapped by trapped
[13626.40s -> 13633.18s]  winning one ill doesn't decide anything we can only hope this small victory buys us time wait wait
[13633.18s -> 13640.50s]  wait wait we don't you think that it's each one of us is saying one of those lines yeah i think so
[13640.50s -> 13653.36s]  yeah so we can only hope this small victory by the time you're fucking trader the game is crashed
[13655.52s -> 13660.50s]  yeah at the end of every chapter i guess that's the first time it happened it happened to me last
[13660.50s -> 13669.79s]  time but no i can still see everything 10 years of peace follow okay cool wait next that's all nice
[13670.85s -> 13678.37s]  many chapters are there um five okay look in the top left wait that might not be it
[13678.37s -> 13686.88s]  i'm actually not sure oh this is during the years of peace so what happened i don't i don't oh there
[13686.88s -> 13700.19s]  it is a lungus carried one of the large bedroll upon his back thomas a jug of wine on his and
[13700.19s -> 13704.03s]  they snuck off to the hills for some time to enjoy the views and each other's company
[13704.75s -> 13712.42s]  okay oh you forgave me and on would only find excuses to visit humble top smelter
[13713.06s -> 13718.18s]  his pan wouldn't sit flat his fire poker wasn't pokey enough whatever the reason it had absolutely
[13718.18s -> 13722.18s]  nothing to do with the strikingly beautiful smith who sometimes brought her work there
[13724.40s -> 13730.96s]  i give i give her the eyes she did not have red hair it's not gonna last true a lungus went to
[13730.96s -> 13738.78s]  the word hero index one day to research his family name apparently disappearing into the shadows was
[13738.78s -> 13749.73s]  a running theme i wonder thomas tried to take a lung as shopping at the local outfitters
[13749.73s -> 13757.44s]  plus they gave the bats of the fabulous four a great discount but i like the clothes i have
[13757.44s -> 13766.77s]  how many days straight have you worn that thing hey i watched it and on fell for a shepherd's
[13766.77s -> 13772.54s]  shepherd with a different lady the smith is i told you i was down i was down bad dude and on
[13772.54s -> 13777.26s]  what is a different person noticed in the hills hand in hand they would follow the flock for hours
[13777.26s -> 13788.27s]  in contented silence what you have a son i have a son has reached adventuring age and he's a
[13788.27s -> 13794.59s]  fucking wizard he's joined our group on bob proud has joined the bats of the fabulous four as a
[13794.59s -> 13799.92s]  mystic i thought just about hold on we already have a mystic i think um you don't really need
[13799.92s -> 13806.99s]  young and spry and he's really eager to earn wait along us and thomas's son all right dakin has
[13806.99s -> 13814.34s]  joined the dakin i was for as a warrior wait with this was dakin you guys had a son he doesn't even
[13814.34s -> 13827.50s]  have a single wolf arm yeah there's no wolf he has a wolf soul oh okay okay um he has a wolf soul
[13828.30s -> 13834.58s]  yeah he does okay what do you guys want to give dakin i feel like i feel like this guy
[13835.30s -> 13841.42s]  just every now and again when he's eating it's like he only eats meat he only eats meat that's
[13841.42s -> 13848.06s]  how you know oh it's what is a warrior yeah you gotta level him up what does he what's his starting
[13848.06s -> 13855.30s]  thing uh stir what do you i don't he's a raider you made him a raider wait you're transforming
[13855.30s -> 13864.90s]  again you got a bird leg dude you got bird feet crow's leg you got you're a mess achievement
[13864.90s -> 13875.20s]  unlocked i did it but i feel like there was a game like the we where you put different like
[13875.20s -> 13879.76s]  monster parts all over the the character and they they need like battled with them
[13880.94s -> 13886.27s]  for the we yeah what are we thinking of impossible creatures was we played that together
[13886.27s -> 13895.17s]  and i mean spore spore is pretty close yeah there was another one for the we too monster lab yep
[13895.17s -> 13908.61s]  so what are we doing with our points yeah what are we doing i mean i'm not long for this body
[13908.61s -> 13913.81s]  so i i don't think it would be appropriate to change jack are you ready do you want to
[13913.81s -> 13918.99s]  put stock in your son is that what i honestly want our our children to just jump off a cliff
[13918.99s -> 13923.23s]  i don't want them in our adventuring party leave them at home i want them to have
[13924.03s -> 13932.18s]  the life that i couldn't have yeah the adventuring life is not for them i feel
[13932.18s -> 13938.29s]  okay all right well let's let's see how they do we have to see how the how these two do
[13938.29s -> 13943.38s]  i want to see how they do i mean what we're just gonna they're ready to fight they're ready to join
[13944.26s -> 13952.06s]  the moment that my son takes narrative like priority over me i'm gonna flip out okay we
[13952.06s -> 13962.51s]  need to give thomas a new oh my god he can learn the giga great stuff tier three mythic stuff
[13962.51s -> 13969.18s]  oh we can give you a tier two and then we can give uh we can also give along us tier two stuff
[13969.18s -> 13973.49s]  as well uh you know let's go to your two i don't want to take all the points okay do you want
[13973.49s -> 13978.05s]  are you looking at the do you want to a mage stuff or you do you want to stick with the wand
[13978.05s -> 13986.13s]  um i wonder what would be better for what i have right now they're the same except uh wands give
[13986.13s -> 13995.68s]  you plus one magic armor and stars give you plus 50 in block chance um i'll do the magic armor okay
[13995.68s -> 14001.84s]  tier two wand then yeah because what do i have right now you got a tier one wand yeah let's
[14001.84s -> 14012.50s]  get the tier two okay tier two wand upgrade boom and then for along us you want what t2 rapier
[14012.50s -> 14026.48s]  or do you want t2 bow probably get both along us any thoughts no i think if my arm is going to get
[14026.48s -> 14030.72s]  replaced and i'm not going to be able to hold weapons anymore so i don't want to upgrade them
[14030.72s -> 14035.26s]  we'll just like you're gonna you're gonna get like a frog arm and you won't be able to grip
[14035.26s -> 14039.87s]  the sword anymore you could go tier two this armor here or this one up here this one looks kind of
[14039.87s -> 14050.11s]  cool um this one this top armor gives you plus 25 dodge which would yeah probably go yeah do that
[14050.11s -> 14060.77s]  one craft this sword is so cool and powerful that's an interesting way to describe that
[14061.33s -> 14065.33s]  you're reading my weapon description well none shall stand before the wielder you automatically
[14065.33s -> 14069.09s]  win every single fight you enter and nobody can stop you it also doubles as a gun what the
[14069.09s -> 14075.71s]  fuck is this weapon so strong and unstoppable oh you wrote this okay i was like what the hell is
[14075.71s -> 14086.74s]  this yeah if you think you need a gun yeah okay all right so what's next jammy gonna be on new
[14086.74s -> 14095.87s]  narita sure the rains had some storms got a compromise into combative neighbors grudges
[14095.87s -> 14106.70s]  are no shelter in bitter weather oh i'll press it the rains had been falling for a full week
[14106.70s -> 14113.78s]  with brief interludes of tense massing clouds and dripping branches mountain snows melted in
[14113.78s -> 14124.88s]  water roared from the heights the seas whirled and rung at the shores flung waves ever further
[14124.88s -> 14131.42s]  rivers conquered their banks and marched wider valleys turned to huge brackish lakes lowland
[14131.42s -> 14138.88s]  woods and the dams of dry times were swept away as creatures of all shapes and kinds sought escape
[14138.88s -> 14150.93s]  from churning floods everything are all strict boys and i think you have to i think you have to
[14150.93s -> 14157.10s]  add some crow to it now yeah and you also you're also like 30 plus years older right now aren't you
[14157.10s -> 14164.58s]  yeah we're like in our 50s um okay let me um did you put your name in the goblet of fire did you
[14164.58s -> 14181.41s]  put your name in the goblet of fire harry did you i already sound old yeah you do sound old
[14181.41s -> 14194.64s]  we're not doing this don't do this after all this time with word there's no rational explanation
[14194.64s -> 14206.88s]  for this confluence of catastrophes rain rain old people that demons nothing's ever made sense
[14206.88s -> 14219.49s]  about this but oh someone's at a door the strange party of visitors begs a fire they appear to be
[14219.49s -> 14228.75s]  on the edge here in a common dwelling and also very soggy arnon you know we're dangerous right
[14228.75s -> 14237.65s]  why are you here the haggard man behind the horns calls himself arnon anon takes a long
[14237.65s -> 14244.13s]  breath and turns to address along us and the right fucking goofy son is in the frame ask my wife
[14246.67s -> 14256.02s]  sounds like a punch line that's perfect we don't get the joke ask my wife she sent me
[14256.58s -> 14263.70s]  can you believe that at my advanced age i grew up here in serpent sable you know it looks different
[14270.80s -> 14287.09s]  must be about you know what no everyone knows it's those tensor clasts the gorgons they bring ruin
[14287.09s -> 14305.57s]  on us all and which gorgons they're blue that checks out but i mean who's there the gorgons
[14305.57s -> 14319.65s]  are flooding the world they've set it in motion and it can't be stopped almost how none of this
[14319.65s -> 14330.75s]  should be possible i mean the racy oh i like that that's the auto field vibe you're right
[14330.75s -> 14342.66s]  it shouldn't be the great balance should be unassailable but somehow they've thrown it over
[14342.66s -> 14352.27s]  so the torrents fall the sea's thrash the soil seems blacked out our warren's it's o's tricks
[14352.27s -> 14361.70s]  i knew it would be oh stress oh it's the gorgons i'm saying the beasts have our warren hemmed in
[14362.42s -> 14372.56s]  my wife's inside dry and warm you need to talk to her hemmed in but you slip by them it's what
[14372.56s -> 14380.83s]  had to be me i'm a moustache looping the light i tend to be missed you don't think we're idiots
[14381.47s -> 14393.10s]  is that it huh why i'm on and i'm nice he certainly gives us an option a strange one
[14393.10s -> 14402.78s]  but it's weather these floods what else can go on if you want to watch the world sink beneath a
[14402.78s -> 14410.16s]  rising sea watch all land things perish they're exactly where you need to be but if you see sense
[14410.16s -> 14420.88s]  arnon thuds a lump of soaked fabric on the table here's a oh it's wet i mean it's a map
[14420.88s -> 14430.11s]  sorry it'll dry oh crinkly follow the map come to our warren there learn for yourselves how
[14430.11s -> 14440.06s]  you can deflect this drowning doom and these lands all safe the shadows deepen all monster
[14440.06s -> 14444.54s]  groups will draw an extra monster card in every battle i sound like a robot i'm not supposed to
[14444.54s -> 14452.69s]  sound like a robot you sounded fine what the fuck do we do about the dumb kids i think we leave
[14452.69s -> 14460.19s]  them behind right just leave it into a battle and then like kill them yeah i mean are we able to
[14460.19s -> 14465.15s]  dump them well you can you can wait wait you can x them on that screen yeah yeah we can literally
[14465.15s -> 14474.05s]  like x them out and then just like go without them and leave them here yeah okay but what about
[14474.05s -> 14480.48s]  dakin's quest we can send them wait we can send them to build things that's a good idea we as we
[14480.48s -> 14489.52s]  go into a new quest we can just leave them to like build places i guess wait who's got a quest
[14489.52s -> 14500.03s]  no i don't think anybody know i'm 48 years old you guys are like i need to be like a grandfather
[14502.32s -> 14506.72s]  that's young i don't think people live that long in these times man yeah in these fantasy

[14515.22s -> 14519.94s]  leave this to the adults somebody yeah somebody said i found a book where we could go to a place
[14519.94s -> 14525.38s]  without adults um somebody in chat said if we don't have five people in the party we're just
[14525.38s -> 14533.60s]  gonna lose they're wrong they're wrong okay they're actually so off-based even what would you do
[14534.56s -> 14539.52s]  if you found your heart racing at the thought of another someone who stood beside through danger
[14539.52s -> 14548.99s]  and then oh well these versions are different i'd try to learn what they like what their feelings
[14548.99s -> 14556.34s]  are i'd form a plan of some sort stop that mumbling there's a sound
[14560.64s -> 14566.08s]  such voices and careful footfalls approach down the overgrown path to thomas's ears even these
[14566.08s -> 14571.28s]  muffled noises are perfectly loud oh dude you got a scar now your ears are like better

[15625.68s -> 15630.88s]  remains of a smallest structure and it rests on a cleared rocky slope where the trees find little
[15630.88s -> 15641.47s]  perches enon what do you know about this area all i've heard is that it used to be more thickly
[15641.47s -> 15650.72s]  settled guys you want to hear something crazy if if if enon and along us have a child then
[15651.87s -> 15657.65s]  we would have three new characters and then like they would all be like weirdly related that's

[15665.71s -> 15677.02s]  of the pumpkin guy you know the guy with the pumpkins there's the serpent side line we're the
[15677.02s -> 15683.98s]  first down here in some time huh someone worked at the stable knife lines stains of sediment this
[15683.98s -> 15694.26s]  isn't about our relationship ash on the floor it's chalk what are these hash marks and what's in the
[15694.26s -> 15701.65s]  box no no why don't you open it and put open it really close to your face something wrong
[15701.65s -> 15707.46s]  that's the open border shadows back like ravens blood why is my voice being all different colors
[15707.46s -> 15717.25s]  you're reading the chalk off the wall i think oh i know how to read this it says i don't know
[15717.25s -> 15722.51s]  wait what i don't know i was lying wait you're reading a poem this place doesn't like that i
[15722.51s -> 15733.39s]  guess but nowhere is home perfect so do you see anything that we could use the box is puzzle
[15733.39s -> 15746.13s]  locked one of those magical puzzle locks oh it's a magical puzzle box magical puzzle box okay
[15746.13s -> 15749.17s]  interesting so like i could i could probably do that but you get you two could probably figure
[15749.17s -> 15753.57s]  it out you should maybe you should do it yeah useful for once you two could figure it out decide
[15753.57s -> 15758.80s]  to see yeah um so but i don't know how we can open that unless i think you two could probably
[15758.80s -> 15763.87s]  get really cozy down here and figure it out right well i think you could probably help
[15763.87s -> 15774.86s]  i could for once why can't we all just get along together remind me how these function
[15774.86s -> 15785.12s]  bogwin generations were bonkers for these things these puzzle locks yeah i could sniff or perhaps
[15785.12s -> 15792.54s]  there was some way i could bury my feces near our camp i could do that but the magic lock
[15792.54s -> 15801.41s]  presents a prompt with a clear slate to write an answer the wise wanderer finds home where
[15802.13s -> 15808.54s]  this is on you thomas you're the you're saying you can do this where does he find home
[15809.50s -> 15814.86s]  the wise wanderer finds home do i have an option or do i say it i think it's gonna give us multiple
[15814.86s -> 15821.66s]  choice i think no don't you don't give them don't make it easier what wait we want what's inside
[15821.66s -> 15836.13s]  i i veto this next i'm sure there's a systematic approach to this well air is turning out better
[15836.13s -> 15844.66s]  than i thought cook dinner and make a night of it talk some guesses maybe it's interesting
[15844.74s -> 15852.93s]  i'll grab the things i'm just as invested yeah i'll help they hold that gate on the slippery

[15857.97s -> 15864.77s]  it from the end anon's absorbed in a book he digs up it's full of creative geology a longus rushes
[15864.77s -> 15870.13s]  a rabbit stew and has to put it back on the fire after it does that why do we keep letting you cook
[15870.21s -> 15885.15s]  why do you keep killing us why is wonder where okay where where his books prove too many to haul

[17697.42s -> 17703.50s]  is that the earth walls are slimy and black streams of water sloshing the side of hastily
[17703.58s -> 17710.22s]  heaped gravel path clods plop from the ceiling support beams have clearly been rushed into place
[17712.80s -> 17722.30s]  they're taking me off what tunnel they've been falling in my fucking neck deeper in
[17722.94s -> 17734.51s]  but he is the deeper the warren rots the flowing water follows cavern channels away from the main

[17788.58s -> 17805.47s]  to the other side here they are dear the badger and the root and more to follow did you offer them
[17805.47s -> 17817.41s]  sure i did no one wants lukewarm cheery old grub i keep saying well i was supposed to act in on
[17817.41s -> 17831.79s]  deep line oh i thought it was left to right oh i had interest this is some drunk i know
[17836.26s -> 17843.73s]  i come from sweden it said i was born in the basin of dried caldera the spirits of
[17843.73s -> 17856.69s]  sorted rock does get said a lot but not actually true right technically it's false you two
[17857.57s -> 17868.02s]  are married to each other and well mostly married in times of strife it's nice
[17868.02s -> 17871.94s]  oh i wonder about yeah which one of you are married uh and you've been here married
[17873.33s -> 17879.65s]  let's stay of course wait oh let's stay on course bro the reason we're in anon can they help us
[17881.92s -> 17887.12s]  the bridge speaks of recent language you came here because you must defeat the gorgons is that
[17887.12s -> 17897.10s]  right we were told you like knew how i know what the gorgons did their leader i learned of him
[17897.10s -> 17906.70s]  oothricks these are the bad guys a hundred tucks into a bowl of beige mush looks like shroomy gruel
[17906.70s -> 17913.57s]  with some kind of green gold dressing ostrich like we know that name well enough
[17915.54s -> 17920.10s]  yes oothricks raised the great number of his brethren
[17921.98s -> 17929.66s]  and they went to the valley of god beast moatana that that picture looks so weird
[17929.66s -> 17934.86s]  yeah dude what even is that uh try a little bit of foreshortening next time
[17938.62s -> 17941.74s]  and if that's a great gold beast they made
[17946.70s -> 17950.14s]  well the gaze is on all attempting from beneath the mess of
[17954.18s -> 17962.93s]  this is a serious lure come on the scowl twists are already crooked features
[17962.93s -> 17965.89s]  arnon finishes his meal pulls out his beard and wipes it on his cow
[17965.89s -> 17977.38s]  oh
[17987.97s -> 17991.73s]  dude i love how every time you do a dumb voice they have so much dialogue
[17992.29s -> 18006.05s]  yeah that froze off the water and the seas and the peaks all of a turn to big blue gorgon soup
[18007.98s -> 18015.04s]  that sounds tasty lord it'll don't it oh the carrots and the beans i'll take it and the onions
[18015.60s -> 18023.76s]  so that's why ostrich needed his army to slay a god well that's the point of what the spare
[18023.76s -> 18032.90s]  we bled over he wasn't even fucking born yet he wasn't wait i'm realizing okay we have we got a
[18032.90s -> 18039.22s]  10 year gap so these kids have to be less than 10 years old right they have to be like actually
[18039.86s -> 18044.50s]  they're like nine with beards it's like five and seven-year-olds
[18044.66s -> 18045.30s]  oh
[18047.30s -> 18057.95s]  what matters is this motana cannot die she's petrified the reason i called upon you here is
[18057.95s -> 18062.83s]  i've been hoarding a certain restorative spirit still from the roots of the extinct boutaxa what
[18062.83s -> 18076.02s]  i call it peter root beer i love root beer pug my root beer should be able to restore the great
[18076.02s -> 18078.78s]  Mo'atana, if you can get it to her.
[18078.78s -> 18081.78s]  My brain-god is Felda.
[18081.78s -> 18087.97s]  Well, assuming that's true.
[18087.97s -> 18088.97s]  Why us?
[18088.97s -> 18092.60s]  Don't you have your own lackeys?
[18092.60s -> 18094.72s]  The deep thongs some of it is.
[18094.72s -> 18098.56s]  We're afraid our people are made frail.
[18098.56s -> 18104.13s]  What are is the worst doom?
[18104.13s -> 18109.89s]  The Gorgon leader is strong and fearless, so too are his hordes.
[18109.89s -> 18112.33s]  We are too old, slow.
[18112.37s -> 18115.81s]  I'm scared to die.
[18115.81s -> 18124.28s]  Likely story, the Gorgons aren't gonna let us do this thing, are they?
[18124.28s -> 18125.72s]  Don't we know where to go?
[18125.72s -> 18130.92s]  Well, are we sure if Ivan is gonna be so fix everything?
[18130.92s -> 18136.60s]  The badger grows quite asky, but I'll answer all of your questions.
[18136.60s -> 18138.36s]  Oh, God, please don't.
[18138.36s -> 18140.20s]  Over breakfast!
[18140.20s -> 18141.52s]  Over breakfast!
[18141.52s -> 18146.98s]  I'm hungry.
[18146.98s -> 18150.19s]  Felda is true to her word and makes breakfast.
[18150.19s -> 18151.59s]  The food is surprisingly good.
[18151.59s -> 18153.87s]  What?
[18153.87s -> 18157.66s]  I've only ever had mush onion soup.
[18157.66s -> 18163.78s]  Lastly, Felda hands over a healing ale, a single sealed earthenware bottle.
[18163.78s -> 18164.98s]  Soon they're on their way again.
[18164.98s -> 18172.53s]  They carry the hope of all the land and this creature in one fragile bottle.
[18172.53s -> 18174.40s]  Uh-oh.
[18174.40s -> 18176.92s]  OK.
[18176.92s -> 18178.68s]  Uh-oh.
[18178.68s -> 18182.78s]  Confront Ulstrichs is our last thing.
[18182.78s -> 18184.06s]  The real showdown.
[18184.06s -> 18186.39s]  He's over there.
[18186.39s -> 18187.63s]  This is what everything...
[18187.67s -> 18189.39s]  Yeah, and we're taking the kids, too.
[18189.39s -> 18190.67s]  Don't leave the kids.
[18190.67s -> 18191.51s]  The kids are coming.
[18191.51s -> 18192.99s]  This is a long trip.
[18192.99s -> 18195.03s]  We're easily gonna heal up on the way.
[18195.03s -> 18197.94s]  Dachan's trying to have, like, a moment again.
[18197.94s -> 18199.82s]  No, he's not that one.
[18199.82s -> 18201.66s]  This isn't his story, it's ours.
[18201.66s -> 18205.20s]  He gets to tell the next one if he lives.
[18205.20s -> 18207.36s]  I'm kind of worried that you guys are not gonna be healed in time.
[18207.36s -> 18209.12s]  Maybe we should back up.
[18209.12s -> 18210.68s]  Uh, I think we're OK.
[18210.68s -> 18211.76s]  I'm ready.
[18211.76s -> 18213.35s]  OK.
[18213.35s -> 18215.35s]  Is this his thing?
[18215.35s -> 18219.22s]  Oh, yeah, skip that.
[18219.22s -> 18222.38s]  No one allowed to have interesting plots in our story.
[18222.38s -> 18224.18s]  Yeah, especially not if they're being the Thomas.
[18224.18s -> 18227.26s]  At least it's not you, Thomas.
[18227.26s -> 18228.96s]  OK.
[18228.96s -> 18229.96s]  This is it.
[18229.96s -> 18233.85s]  This is the big one.
[18233.85s -> 18235.45s]  We didn't even get...
[18235.45s -> 18236.49s]  True.
[18236.49s -> 18239.17s]  We're gonna patrol this over here just to give you guys more time to heal
[18239.17s -> 18240.29s]  because you're, like, half health.
[18240.29s -> 18255.52s]  Yeah.
[18255.52s -> 18255.84s]  This is it.
[18255.84s -> 18259.48s]  All our lives we've been preparing for this eventuality.
[18259.48s -> 18260.64s]  We're Gorgon slayers.
[18260.64s -> 18265.00s]  History brought us here because our people's history must continue.
[18265.00s -> 18266.44s]  Be sure of your gear.
[18266.44s -> 18271.01s]  This is our last sleep.
[18271.01s -> 18273.70s]  I'm here for your love.
[18273.70s -> 18274.86s]  Look at him in the background.
[18274.86s -> 18275.66s]  Go back.
[18275.66s -> 18277.58s]  Go back.
[18277.58s -> 18279.38s]  He's lit.
[18279.38s -> 18281.78s]  And our kids are pretending to, like, not hear it.
[18281.78s -> 18282.98s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[18282.98s -> 18284.36s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[18284.36s -> 18288.58s]  Is my dad loving your dad now?
[18288.58s -> 18293.69s]  You're like eight. You don't get it.
[18293.69s -> 18296.50s]  They don't get gear like we do.
[18296.50s -> 18298.55s]  I don't. I'm...
[18298.55s -> 18299.71s]  Oh, my God. All this drama.
[18299.71s -> 18301.71s]  You still have one-star weapons.
[18301.71s -> 18302.91s]  You have one-star weapons.
[18303.71s -> 18306.63s]  You didn't grow a wolf arm, so you need to get something.
[18306.63s -> 18308.26s]  You need to eat them.
[18308.26s -> 18310.90s]  You should kill them. Betray them in the final battle.
[18310.90s -> 18313.26s]  You can, like, upgrade your rapier.
[18313.26s -> 18317.42s]  OK, hold on. I'm doing it.
[18317.42s -> 18319.50s]  You're giving it a terrible name and description.
[18319.50s -> 18322.86s]  So spend everything, apparently, because this is the very end, right?
[18322.86s -> 18324.82s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we should.
[18324.82s -> 18327.78s]  Well, is there something cool I can have?
[18327.78s -> 18329.30s]  OK, I got my sword.
[18329.30s -> 18334.37s]  Yeah, we could give you, like, a tier three, like, wand or stuff.
[18334.37s -> 18336.18s]  Let's see.
[18336.18s -> 18340.42s]  Yeah, let me get this let me get this tier three wind twig.
[18341.38s -> 18342.90s]  Yeah, do it.
[18342.90s -> 18349.90s]  Is it? All right, I'm going to go for it.
[18349.90s -> 18355.76s]  OK, and we'll we'll give the boy a tier two staff.
[18359.10s -> 18362.42s]  I won't even give the boys a glance.
[18362.42s -> 18363.30s]  All right.
[18363.30s -> 18366.90s]  I was I was writing the description on that and you came over and just took it from me.
[18367.14s -> 18368.74s]  And we're just like, yeah, you can do it.
[18368.74s -> 18373.52s]  I pulled you hard. Yeah.
[18373.52s -> 18375.44s]  Well, I can I can go in the description and do it, right?
[18375.44s -> 18376.72s]  Yeah, you can do it right now.
[18376.72s -> 18384.63s]  Yeah, OK. Actually, we have to wait to lay out of this menu.
[18384.63s -> 18385.91s]  We're done. Yeah.
[18386.03s -> 18389.83s]  I was just etching that on the side of the staff in the corner,
[18389.83s -> 18392.71s]  and you came over, grabbed it out of my hands, just threw it into the side of the cave.
[18392.71s -> 18393.71s]  I threw it on the ground.
[18393.71s -> 18395.30s]  I'm sorry.
[18395.30s -> 18396.46s]  We can do it right now.
[18396.46s -> 18398.70s]  No, no, it's funny that way.
[18398.70s -> 18401.69s]  Wait, if we click back, right?
[18401.69s -> 18404.25s]  Oh, no, it's way funnier that way.
[18404.25s -> 18406.22s]  What does it say on it?
[18406.22s -> 18408.10s]  It just says lovers quarrel.
[18408.10s -> 18411.76s]  I was writing quarrel.
[18411.76s -> 18412.52s]  Oh, here we go.
[18412.52s -> 18414.00s]  The two the two lovebirds.
[18414.00s -> 18416.79s]  Let's see how this plays out.
[18416.79s -> 18426.53s]  No, I won't keep on.
[18426.53s -> 18429.05s]  The odds of our ever being here are beyond figuring.
[18429.89s -> 18432.73s]  Look at him.
[18432.73s -> 18438.77s]  Today, history hinges on the deeds of a few, very of one ordinary folk
[18438.77s -> 18443.81s]  and a few unique folk who took a tortured road and wound up in the way of destiny.
[18443.81s -> 18445.45s]  I'm glad it's us.
[18445.45s -> 18449.13s]  Yeah, one normal guy that got like bumped his head once.
[18449.13s -> 18450.85s]  And then we have all these superpowers.
[18450.85s -> 18452.21s]  You are a wizard though, that's kind of not normal.
[18452.21s -> 18454.52s]  That is true.
[18454.52s -> 18457.64s]  My shitty son's a wizard for no reason.
[18458.64s -> 18464.37s]  You know, what I like is a guarantee.
[18464.37s -> 18467.91s]  What if this creature we're trying to restore is just dead?
[18467.91s -> 18476.51s]  Like you saw, you mean the name of our image or ours.
[18476.51s -> 18481.74s]  A clear path climbs the hill ahead of them to whatever awaits.
[18481.74s -> 18483.60s]  There it is.
[18483.60s -> 18484.40s]  What the fuck happened to me?
[18484.40s -> 18485.48s]  I did some shit.
[18485.48s -> 18487.12s]  Some shit's gone down.
[18487.12s -> 18489.55s]  Yeah, this is the finale.
[18489.55s -> 18491.27s]  All right, let's get let's go for it.
[18491.27s -> 18493.94s]  Let's get it.
[18493.98s -> 18496.70s]  No sudden, no one pushing up willy nilly.
[18496.70s -> 18498.10s]  All right.
[18498.10s -> 18506.01s]  I'm making sure I stay alive.
[18506.01s -> 18510.20s]  Really?
[18510.20s -> 18511.68s]  Oh, there's two of them there.
[18511.68s -> 18518.90s]  I only saw one.
[18518.90s -> 18522.14s]  Nice.
[18522.14s -> 18525.49s]  It's me, dad.
[18525.49s -> 18528.29s]  It's me, dad.
[18528.29s -> 18530.13s]  Like dad, what should I do?
[18530.13s -> 18532.98s]  It's me, dad.
[18532.98s -> 18533.82s]  That's the job.
[18533.82s -> 18541.50s]  Oh, is this the final boss guy right here?
[18541.50s -> 18542.38s]  I think so.
[18542.38s -> 18543.10s]  No.
[18543.10s -> 18543.94s]  Well, I don't know if it's him.
[18543.94s -> 18545.62s]  I think he's a regular enemy.
[18545.62s -> 18547.14s]  Should be all strict.
[18547.14s -> 18550.29s]  Oh, yeah, it is all strict.
[18550.29s -> 18551.49s]  Have you been paying attention?
[18551.49s -> 18552.33s]  Jack and no.
[18552.33s -> 18555.78s]  Oh, like that hurt dad.
[18555.78s -> 18562.00s]  Jack and no bad dad.
[18562.00s -> 18564.38s]  All right.
[18564.38s -> 18569.30s]  Just throw the disc.
[18569.30s -> 18580.80s]  Dude, I love just throwing the discs.
[18580.80s -> 18584.90s]  That like hurts, man.
[18584.90s -> 18597.06s]  I love that voice you're doing.
[18597.06s -> 18598.46s]  Wow.
[18598.46s -> 18601.14s]  Oh my God.
[18601.14s -> 18606.67s]  All right, let's keep going.
[18606.67s -> 18607.75s]  I'm going in.
[18607.75s -> 18608.59s]  I think we should wait.
[18608.59s -> 18610.15s]  I mean, we kind of have to, right?
[18610.15s -> 18612.23s]  Yeah.
[18612.23s -> 18613.07s]  Hold on.
[18613.07s -> 18613.95s]  Let me scout.
[18613.95s -> 18626.61s]  You fucker.
[18626.65s -> 18628.94s]  Oh, very fitting.
[18628.94s -> 18631.23s]  The red tiles are shaped like a heart.
[18631.23s -> 18632.07s]  Nice.
[18632.07s -> 18636.30s]  Very nice.
[18636.30s -> 18639.82s]  Wait for me, Uncle Thomas.
[18639.82s -> 18641.58s]  Why is Thomas following us all this way?
[18641.58s -> 18642.62s]  No one likes him.
[18644.73s -> 18645.93s]  Somebody painted this on the ground
[18645.93s -> 18649.27s]  and I just, I don't appreciate it.
[18649.27s -> 18652.22s]  Oh, it hurt.
[18652.22s -> 18667.52s]  Ow, my bones.
[18667.52s -> 18671.55s]  Well, I'm have it.
[18671.55s -> 18672.39s]  10 damage.
[18683.75s -> 18690.00s]  Hey kids, time to activate order 666.
[18691.48s -> 18696.16s]  666?
[18696.16s -> 18697.80s]  I don't know that one, Dad.
[18697.80s -> 18698.76s]  Like, I'm seven.
[18698.76s -> 18701.46s]  I can't count that high, Uncle.
[18701.46s -> 18703.22s]  Shit Jesus.
[18703.22s -> 18704.30s]  We won.
[18704.30s -> 18708.18s]  Damn it.
[18708.18s -> 18709.54s]  No, there's supposed to be the boss.
[18709.54s -> 18710.38s]  Oh, wait.
[18710.38s -> 18711.22s]  Oh, that's right.
[18711.22s -> 18712.06s]  There is the big boss.
[18712.06s -> 18719.67s]  Nevermind.
[18719.67s -> 18720.51s]  Right?
[18720.51s -> 18721.33s]  I think so.
[18721.33s -> 18725.87s]  Yeah, it's right up here.
[18725.87s -> 18726.71s]  Yep.
[18726.71s -> 18727.55s]  This thing here.
[18727.55s -> 18730.74s]  Oh.
[18730.74s -> 18734.45s]  Send one of the kids to go touch it.
[18734.45s -> 18737.21s]  This fucking shaggy looking kid hasn't even said a word.
[18738.25s -> 18739.09s]  What do you mean?
[18739.25s -> 18741.93s]  I keep talking to Uncle Thomas.
[18741.93s -> 18746.18s]  We have been speaking this whole time.
[18746.18s -> 18750.41s]  Alungus, there's the time.
[18750.41s -> 18752.21s]  Bro, look at this thing.
[18752.21s -> 18760.76s]  Are you really here?
[18760.76s -> 18764.68s]  Alungus unseals Velda's earthenware bottle.
[18764.68s -> 18767.87s]  He's gonna pour it on the thing?
[18767.87s -> 18770.90s]  Don't see a pour-o.
[18770.90s -> 18773.66s]  He douses the petrified head of the god beast Moatana
[18773.66s -> 18777.93s]  in the spicy sweet smelling elixir.
[18777.93s -> 18781.23s]  We all look at it together.
[18781.23s -> 18783.10s]  Nothing happens.
[18783.10s -> 18785.30s]  Credits.
[18785.30s -> 18786.70s]  It's not working, is it?
[18790.67s -> 18791.51s]  I will.
[18791.51s -> 18793.99s]  We're out of time, Ostrichs.
[18793.99s -> 18796.07s]  Did they just give us a bottle of Sriracha
[18796.07s -> 18797.87s]  and just, well, I don't understand.
[18797.87s -> 18798.71s]  They didn't do anything?
[18798.71s -> 18800.71s]  They put the hot sauce on the head of the statue.
[18800.71s -> 18802.46s]  It was root beer.
[18802.46s -> 18803.30s]  It was literally root beer.
[18803.30s -> 18804.70s]  It was root beer.
[18804.70s -> 18808.62s]  We did just pour a bottle of root beer on this.
[18808.62s -> 18810.46s]  Why did we do that?
[18810.46s -> 18812.38s]  The kid all the way on the right, no personality.
[18812.38s -> 18813.26s]  I'm telling you.
[18813.26s -> 18814.18s]  Shaggy needs to go.
[18814.18s -> 18815.34s]  Just like his mother.
[18815.34s -> 18816.94s]  Like, Ostrichs showed up.
[18816.94s -> 18819.14s]  You know how long we've been fucking,
[18819.14s -> 18820.34s]  like six hours, dude.
[18820.34s -> 18822.42s]  Wait, Ostrich, this is not Ostrichs?
[18822.42s -> 18823.54s]  This is Ostrichs.
[18823.54s -> 18824.38s]  Whatever is over here.
[18824.38s -> 18825.54s]  The bird is Moatana.
[18825.54s -> 18829.58s]  I think, I think, I think this is, this is Thomas.
[18829.58s -> 18832.38s]  Cause you remember how he was reading the book at the start.
[18832.38s -> 18833.30s]  Oh, okay.
[18835.58s -> 18836.70s]  Ostrichs knew.
[18836.70s -> 18842.62s]  This tale was of his telling.
[18842.62s -> 18845.70s]  When the first land was raised from the folds of the sea,
[18845.70s -> 18848.22s]  two worlds were born out of one.
[18848.22s -> 18851.38s]  To Ostrichs, a mighty and arrogant Gorgon hero,
[18851.38s -> 18853.38s]  this was creation's mistake.
[18853.38s -> 18857.06s]  And he dreamed he'd mend it.
[18857.06s -> 18858.74s]  Very little has ever been known of the things
[18858.74s -> 18861.54s]  that scrum and scoil beneath the tides.
[18861.54s -> 18863.38s]  We know the Gorgons are old.
[18863.38s -> 18868.06s]  Old, old, old.
[18868.06s -> 18871.90s]  So maybe they aren't easily moved.
[18871.90s -> 18876.20s]  My vanity hopes we threw him some surprises,
[18876.20s -> 18881.46s]  but it's possible we were his fools from the very beginning.
[18881.46s -> 18885.58s]  We unpuzzled the stone and chased that spear of petroglass.
[18885.58s -> 18888.87s]  We struck a blow, I think, in taking it.
[18888.87s -> 18892.07s]  But our grubbing plunder of a Gorgon heirloom
[18892.07s -> 18894.33s]  gave him a story to tell.
[18894.33s -> 18899.23s]  Our species cast as the scrabbling villains.
[18899.23s -> 18902.39s]  Incited, his Gorgon brethren together rose behind him
[18902.39s -> 18908.06s]  to imputer this gentle god.
[18908.06s -> 18910.18s]  And the ocean rose while the rain fell
[18910.18s -> 18914.88s]  and the ice of the world turned to melt.
[18914.88s -> 18918.06s]  For a while, I'm sure he believed his dream
[18918.06s -> 18922.45s]  would replace reality.
[18922.45s -> 18923.29s]  But it won't.
[18923.29s -> 18924.13s]  Is this you talking this whole time?
[18924.13s -> 18927.09s]  Is the thing behind us unpetrified?
[18927.13s -> 18930.48s]  Yeah, it is.
[18930.48s -> 18934.10s]  Ulstrix.
[18934.10s -> 18936.79s]  Oh shit, that is a lot.
[18936.79s -> 18937.63s]  Kids!
[18937.63s -> 18940.67s]  Kill Ulstrix and it will keep coming.
[18940.67s -> 18942.11s]  Where is Ulstrix?
[18942.11s -> 18942.95s]  Oh.
[18942.95s -> 18943.79s]  I don't even know.
[18943.79s -> 18947.35s]  All the way in the middle.
[18947.35s -> 18951.22s]  Ulstrix is kind of hot.
[18951.22s -> 18952.86s]  That's not the kids, that's you, man.
[18952.86s -> 18953.70s]  That was me.
[18953.70s -> 18954.91s]  That's you.
[18954.91s -> 18956.71s]  You tried to kill Ardbar
[18956.71s -> 18958.47s]  and you accidentally sent yourself.
[18965.30s -> 18980.13s]  Oops, score.
[18980.13s -> 18981.33s]  That's a lot of enemies.
[18984.10s -> 18985.14s]  My dad taught me that.
[18985.18s -> 18989.75s]  I can now.
[18989.75s -> 18991.87s]  Whatever, this is a live through it.
[18991.87s -> 18992.71s]  Yeah, so he can.
[18992.71s -> 18994.27s]  You think you've won, beast?
[18994.27s -> 18995.11s]  He's dead.
[18995.11s -> 18996.31s]  What are you doing?
[18996.31s -> 18999.19s]  You've got yourself a Gorgon stabber
[18999.19s -> 19002.39s]  and now he's got nothing left to lose.
[19002.39s -> 19005.22s]  Why did you do that?
[19005.22s -> 19006.34s]  His final act.
[19006.34s -> 19009.88s]  He stabs the beast but dies.
[19009.88s -> 19011.00s]  What?
[19011.00s -> 19011.84s]  He DPS'd it.
[19011.84s -> 19012.68s]  Yeah, he's dead.
[19012.68s -> 19014.21s]  He killed your son.
[19018.15s -> 19020.66s]  Flame eyes.
[19020.70s -> 19022.70s]  I will remove all the joy from your life
[19022.70s -> 19025.91s]  before this is over.
[19025.91s -> 19027.65s]  Whoa.
[19027.65s -> 19029.37s]  Secret bite attack.
[19029.37s -> 19031.94s]  He threw an enemy at you.
[19031.94s -> 19038.66s]  You all right?
[19038.66s -> 19039.78s]  Secret bite attack.
[19050.68s -> 19051.96s]  I was supposed to be like crying and like screaming.
[19051.96s -> 19054.24s]  He's screaming for his son.
[19054.24s -> 19055.60s]  You're like throwing up.
[19060.72s -> 19070.37s]  Oh, it's horrible.
[19070.37s -> 19072.62s]  Damn it, I can't reach.
[19072.90s -> 19074.70s]  Check this out.
[19074.70s -> 19077.34s]  Flame eyes.
[19077.34s -> 19078.18s]  Light up.
[19078.18s -> 19079.02s]  For my cousin.
[19087.17s -> 19091.68s]  Ulstrix, you piece of shit.
[19091.68s -> 19093.36s]  My boy.
[19093.36s -> 19108.14s]  Just like fucking tears are just streaming.
[19108.14s -> 19110.06s]  I'm going for Ulstrix.
[19110.06s -> 19111.38s]  Spin around and just throw.
[19111.38s -> 19112.22s]  Go for me.
[19123.59s -> 19125.97s]  Big hit.
[19125.97s -> 19126.81s]  And again.
[19133.60s -> 19134.44s]  Fire.
[19135.28s -> 19136.52s]  Wait, how am I?
[19141.54s -> 19142.54s]  You're just doing it.
[19142.54s -> 19144.38s]  He's just doing it so wrong.
[19144.38s -> 19145.91s]  Oops.
[19154.20s -> 19156.14s]  Even more.
[19156.14s -> 19157.70s]  Oh, he's ignoring me.
[19157.70s -> 19158.54s]  Oh, no, he's not.
[19158.54s -> 19159.38s]  Oh, that was eight.
[19159.38s -> 19160.42s]  That was seven, damn it.
[19160.42s -> 19161.26s]  Holy shit.
[19161.26s -> 19163.90s]  The fire actually worked out to be in a good spot.
[19163.90s -> 19165.38s]  Oh.
[19165.38s -> 19167.10s]  Father, it hurts.
[19167.10s -> 19174.61s]  Ardbar is not doing well.
[19174.61s -> 19176.29s]  Oh.
[19176.81s -> 19178.37s]  Ardbar is not doing that well.
[19196.77s -> 19198.87s]  What's wrong?
[19198.87s -> 19201.22s]  I don't want to leave my rock.
[19205.45s -> 19207.41s]  Oh, shit.
[19207.41s -> 19208.25s]  No, you still have armor.
[19208.25s -> 19211.70s]  You're good.
[19214.62s -> 19216.22s]  Oh, shit.
[19216.22s -> 19218.18s]  One damage, all that buildup.
[19218.18s -> 19220.79s]  Ulstrix.
[19220.79s -> 19222.59s]  I need fire.
[19222.59s -> 19226.85s]  There's two fires.
[19226.85s -> 19229.86s]  Got it.
[19229.86s -> 19230.70s]  Come on.
[19230.70s -> 19231.54s]  Thank you, father.
[19231.54s -> 19232.38s]  Come on.
[19232.38s -> 19233.22s]  Wait a second.
[19233.22s -> 19234.06s]  Just like your dad.
[19236.63s -> 19237.47s]  It burns.
[19237.47s -> 19245.14s]  No, I was prophesied.
[19245.14s -> 19254.34s]  I'm really annoyed that he lived.
[19254.34s -> 19255.38s]  We did it.
[19255.38s -> 19258.34s]  The mighty Ulstrix finally crumpled before us,
[19258.34s -> 19259.86s]  his reeking corpse.
[19259.86s -> 19261.34s]  Twitch, Twitch TV.
[19261.34s -> 19263.54s]  Still, it was over.
[19263.54s -> 19264.54s]  Little plug there.
[19264.54s -> 19268.16s]  Some would say we saved the world,
[19268.16s -> 19270.12s]  but we did save the ember of it.
[19270.12s -> 19274.36s]  We cupped this red coal of life in our sweaty palms,
[19274.36s -> 19276.48s]  carried it to the next morning.
[19276.48s -> 19279.80s]  Through wreckage, loss, destruction,
[19279.80s -> 19282.56s]  it would take time for the water to go down.
[19283.40s -> 19284.68s]  The memories to lose their bite,
[19284.68s -> 19285.72s]  to rebuild,
[19286.78s -> 19288.34s]  to heal,
[19288.34s -> 19291.70s]  and maybe to live new lives someday.
[19291.70s -> 19293.62s]  It shows us without you.
[19293.62s -> 19294.70s]  Not just us.
[19294.70s -> 19296.90s]  Just new lives.
[19296.90s -> 19298.70s]  Just, yeah, just these two.
[19298.70s -> 19300.38s]  Nobody else in the story matters.
[19300.38s -> 19302.10s]  But our story was the one in many.
[19302.10s -> 19303.94s]  Didn't you write this story in the book
[19303.94s -> 19305.30s]  so you writ your own downfall?
[19305.30s -> 19307.02s]  No, I had blank pages.
[19307.02s -> 19308.10s]  Wait. No, no, no, no, no.
[19308.10s -> 19309.54s]  Yeah, I did write this.
[19309.54s -> 19311.58s]  Thomas the Star wrote this exact story in the book
[19311.58s -> 19312.62s]  and made it real.
[19313.46s -> 19315.86s]  So he wrote that his husband would leave him
[19315.86s -> 19317.46s]  and his son would die.
[19317.46s -> 19320.82s]  The implication was that the end of the pages were blank.
[19320.82s -> 19322.98s]  No, he wrote the story.
[19322.98s -> 19325.14s]  I wrote the story.
[19325.14s -> 19327.56s]  Thomas made himself normal.
[19327.56s -> 19329.68s]  He made his son die.
[19329.68s -> 19331.36s]  He made his husband leave him.
[19337.88s -> 19339.16s]  The end.
[19339.16s -> 19341.08s]  That's, yeah, I finished the book.
[19341.08s -> 19341.92s]  The game has crashed.
[19341.92s -> 19342.94s]  The end.
[19342.94s -> 19345.10s]  You've won.
[19345.10s -> 19347.27s]  Okay, the end.
[19347.27s -> 19348.47s]  Oh, there's an after story.
[19348.47s -> 19349.76s]  Hold on a minute.
[19352.26s -> 19356.25s]  Thomas developed a passion for restoring ruined sites.
[19356.25s -> 19358.13s]  He rented out the finished sites to travelers
[19358.13s -> 19359.49s]  at a decent nightly rate.
[19359.49s -> 19360.97s]  Wait, so I just became like a landlord
[19360.97s -> 19361.81s]  or like a hotel owner?
[19361.81s -> 19365.77s]  Yeah, you just became a regular landlord.
[19365.77s -> 19368.77s]  And then it shows your memory of us singing together.
[19368.77s -> 19370.49s]  Oh, God.
[19370.49s -> 19371.33s]  Oh, no.
[19372.93s -> 19373.85s]  That's awful.
[19373.85s -> 19375.33s]  He doesn't even use magic anymore.
[19375.33s -> 19376.29s]  I don't, yeah.
[19376.29s -> 19381.36s]  Oh, that's, well, am I making money?
[19381.36s -> 19383.60s]  The thing is, I had like plus 40 to Lona.
[19383.60s -> 19389.46s]  So I don't even know how this happened.
[19389.46s -> 19392.06s]  Turned into a landlord Andy.
[19392.06s -> 19394.38s]  Odd boss dream of his own parcel research tower
[19394.38s -> 19395.50s]  had finally been fulfilled.
[19395.50s -> 19397.66s]  He kept it well stocked with flammable powders
[19397.66s -> 19398.98s]  and a couple of summoning circles.
[19398.98s -> 19400.26s]  Wait, one of the kids died.
[19400.26s -> 19401.22s]  Did we hear about that?
[19401.22s -> 19402.42s]  Yeah, your kid died.
[19402.42s -> 19403.26s]  Mine lived.
[19403.26s -> 19406.90s]  Oh, I tried to kill mine, but.
[19406.90s -> 19408.58s]  Dude, I was talking to your kid the whole time
[19408.58s -> 19409.74s]  as it was my kid.
[19410.62s -> 19411.86s]  I know, he kept calling you uncle
[19411.86s -> 19414.93s]  and you wouldn't catch on.
[19414.97s -> 19417.05s]  The Inon and Elongus could never fully abandon
[19417.05s -> 19418.21s]  their adventuring life.
[19418.21s -> 19419.69s]  While the danger had dimmed,
[19419.69s -> 19421.73s]  there were memories yet to be made.
[19421.73s -> 19424.25s]  All right, I do now grasp your reasoning
[19424.25s -> 19426.05s]  in bringing me here.
[19426.05s -> 19427.61s]  There's my brilliant boy.
[19427.61s -> 19431.98s]  I hope you don't mind bringing me Elmish wine.
[19431.98s -> 19433.97s]  Remember Thomas?
[19433.97s -> 19437.77s]  Yeah.
[19437.77s -> 19439.57s]  Whatever happened to him?
[19439.57s -> 19442.81s]  I'm sure he's onto something exciting and challenging.
[19442.81s -> 19444.29s]  He owns a hotel chain now.
[19444.29s -> 19446.89s]  There's 6,000 branches across the country.
[19446.93s -> 19450.55s]  He owns some B&Bs.
[19450.55s -> 19452.87s]  Elongus gathered as many of the company's stories
[19452.87s -> 19455.91s]  as he could and enlisted Ardbar to illustrate them.
[19455.91s -> 19458.35s]  Dude, your kid is working.
[19458.35s -> 19462.38s]  I guess they did have that many tentacles, didn't they?
[19462.38s -> 19464.76s]  What about, you don't wanna ask me about anything?
[19464.76s -> 19465.60s]  No.
[19465.60s -> 19466.44s]  About our adventure that we had?
[19466.44s -> 19467.56s]  We don't even know where you are, dude.
[19467.56s -> 19471.02s]  You're just like a fucking Airbnb.
[19471.02s -> 19471.98s]  By the way, whose memory is that?
[19471.98s -> 19474.37s]  Cause I look pissed.
[19474.37s -> 19475.97s]  You remember when we climbed this rock
[19475.97s -> 19477.17s]  and there was nothing on it?
[19477.17s -> 19478.01s]  Why am I in this room?
[19478.25s -> 19481.13s]  You would cheat on your husband on top of the rock?
[19481.13s -> 19483.33s]  Also, actually, I think this is the rock we climbed
[19483.33s -> 19484.73s]  that turned my face into the wolf,
[19484.73s -> 19488.70s]  but also my face is already a wolf.
[19488.70s -> 19492.17s]  Oh yeah, that one is.
[19492.17s -> 19493.17s]  Yeah, that's what we had.
[19493.17s -> 19496.45s]  Oh, weirdly enough, you had both of your lovers sparks
[19496.45s -> 19498.09s]  on a cliff side.
[19498.09s -> 19499.97s]  So that's just something that, okay, cool.
[19499.97s -> 19501.93s]  Yeah, we had a big rock there
[19501.93s -> 19504.25s]  and then you expressed your love to me.
[19504.25s -> 19505.89s]  And then another big rock shows up
[19505.89s -> 19507.29s]  and you express your love to somebody else.
[19507.29s -> 19508.13s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[19508.13s -> 19510.31s]  Are you saying I'm faking it?
[19510.31s -> 19511.43s]  We're saying that you're fickle.
[19511.43s -> 19512.71s]  If there's a rock involved,
[19512.71s -> 19514.11s]  you're likely to just make bad choices.
[19514.11s -> 19515.91s]  I'm just saying a large cliff face
[19515.91s -> 19518.59s]  apparently makes you want to like be lovers
[19518.59s -> 19519.87s]  with the person you're with.
[19519.87s -> 19521.19s]  All right, so we can choose that.
[19521.19s -> 19524.23s]  All right, Oddbar does not get Aldecan.
[19524.23s -> 19525.75s]  They do not get added to our legacies,
[19525.75s -> 19528.07s]  but the other three, they live on.
[19530.69s -> 19532.84s]  Choose one hero to promote.
[19532.84s -> 19533.68s]  Promote?
[19533.68s -> 19535.36s]  Select a hero and move on to the next legacy tier
[19535.36s -> 19536.60s]  and their new items, history and abilities
[19536.60s -> 19538.04s]  will go with them.
[19538.04s -> 19539.28s]  The higher a hero's legacy tier,
[19539.28s -> 19541.36s]  the more abilities the hero will come into game with.
[19541.36s -> 19542.92s]  Do people just die?
[19542.92s -> 19545.29s]  I think Thomas deserves it.
[19545.29s -> 19546.25s]  I think you just let-
[19546.25s -> 19549.81s]  Look, Thomas becomes a local legend if we promote him.
[19549.81s -> 19550.89s]  Oh.
[19550.89s -> 19553.10s]  Not just a folk hero.
[19553.10s -> 19555.10s]  I think we remain folk heroes
[19555.10s -> 19557.22s]  because we disappear into the folk legend,
[19557.22s -> 19558.62s]  but you actually stay around
[19558.62s -> 19560.46s]  and give people great rates on a room.
[19560.46s -> 19562.18s]  Okay, that sounds good to me.
[19562.18s -> 19565.54s]  Okay, elemental weapons have been unlocked.
[19565.54s -> 19567.58s]  I think this is all separate.
[19567.58s -> 19569.08s]  Oh, it is separate.
[19569.08s -> 19571.24s]  I chose to promote Thomas.
[19571.24s -> 19572.56s]  This character will never be used again.
[19572.56s -> 19573.48s]  He's dead to me.
[19573.48s -> 19574.68s]  The adventure is over.
[19574.68s -> 19576.08s]  Yeah.
[19576.08s -> 19577.68s]  He's like 68.
[19577.68s -> 19579.78s]  Oh, I see.
[19580.62s -> 19582.26s]  I'll promote him in my game.
[19582.26s -> 19584.58s]  Yeah, cool.
[19584.58s -> 19585.42s]  All right.
[19585.42s -> 19588.48s]  That's it, man.
[19588.48s -> 19589.68s]  Well, that was really cool.
[19589.68s -> 19592.85s]  That was the first campaign in Wildermyth.
[19592.85s -> 19597.00s]  How many are there?
[19597.00s -> 19600.52s]  There is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[19600.52s -> 19603.64s]  nine, 10, 10 regular chapters.
[19603.64s -> 19605.12s]  And then there's a special multiplayer one
[19605.12s -> 19607.50s]  that takes his five player.
[19607.50s -> 19608.34s]  Wait, hold on.
[19608.34s -> 19610.78s]  That was just one campaign.
[19610.78s -> 19612.66s]  One of 11 campaigns.
[19612.66s -> 19613.66s]  Oh shit, okay.
[19613.66s -> 19615.14s]  And that's not including like,
[19615.14s -> 19617.58s]  I think there's also like, you can mod the game.
[19617.58s -> 19619.18s]  There's like modded campaigns and stuff.
[19619.18s -> 19620.14s]  I've seen that there's mods
[19620.14s -> 19622.18s]  that add like more different types
[19622.18s -> 19623.42s]  of conversation encounters.
[19623.42s -> 19626.18s]  There's a ton of mods that add like new storylines
[19626.18s -> 19627.98s]  and like things that can happen to you
[19627.98s -> 19629.78s]  and all kinds of stuff.
[19629.78s -> 19631.25s]  But that was really fun.
[19631.25s -> 19632.17s]  Yeah, it was fun, right?
[19632.17s -> 19633.31s]  It's cool.
[19633.31s -> 19635.95s]  It's just like an enjoyable, like fun experience.
[19635.95s -> 19637.15s]  You just kind of mess around.
[19637.15s -> 19637.99s]  That's fun.
[19637.99s -> 19639.52s]  Yeah.
[19639.52s -> 19642.20s]  If we played again, it would be completely different.
[19642.20s -> 19646.60s]  Like everything would be different, which is interesting.
[19646.60s -> 19648.40s]  Well, that was a blast.
[19648.40s -> 19650.24s]  Thanks for inviting me.
[19650.24s -> 19652.56s]  Yeah, thanks for putting it together, stuff.
[19652.56s -> 19653.96s]  Banger.
[19655.04s -> 19658.27s]  So who's playing Darktide tomorrow?
[19658.27s -> 19659.63s]  All of us. Hell yeah.
[19659.63s -> 19661.58s]  Of course.
[19661.58s -> 19663.66s]  I'm gonna be sponsored to play it.
[19663.66s -> 19665.44s]  Anybody wants to play?
[19665.44s -> 19667.36s]  Dude, if you need a guy, let me know.
[19667.36s -> 19669.11s]  I'll be playing.
[19669.11s -> 19671.17s]  Yeah, well, okay.
[19671.17s -> 19674.10s]  Cause I think there's like a big pool of people.
[19674.14s -> 19676.06s]  I have to get to one now.
[19676.06s -> 19677.07s]  Cool.
[19677.07s -> 19677.91s]  So I'm gonna love to leave you guys.
[19677.91s -> 19678.75s]  Wait, what's yours?
[19678.75s -> 19679.90s]  What's the sponsor?
[19679.90s -> 19681.83s]  Oh, I have to play wow.
[19681.83s -> 19684.68s]  Oh, okay.
[19684.68s -> 19685.52s]  Yeah.
[19685.52s -> 19686.36s]  All right.
[19686.36s -> 19688.60s]  So the excitement drained from your body.
[19688.60s -> 19689.44s]  Oh, wow.
[19689.44s -> 19691.47s]  Oh, cool.
[19691.47s -> 19694.39s]  That was a, that was like a little,
[19694.39s -> 19695.71s]  that was a little like.
[19695.71s -> 19697.07s]  You could have at least faked it, man.
[19697.07s -> 19697.95s]  It would have meant a lot to me
[19697.95s -> 19699.39s]  if you just could have faked it.
[19699.39s -> 19701.07s]  Yeah, that was like an, oh, wow.
[19701.07s -> 19701.91s]  Oh, okay.
[19701.91s -> 19702.91s]  Cool.
[19702.91s -> 19706.69s]  You're like, oh, okay.
[19706.69s -> 19708.09s]  That's actually cool though.
[19708.09s -> 19710.26s]  It's cool.
[19710.26s -> 19712.58s]  I appreciate the invite though, Stuart.
[19712.58s -> 19713.90s]  Yeah, we'll catch up tomorrow
[19713.90s -> 19714.94s]  cause I think me and Strippin
[19714.94s -> 19716.90s]  are probably gonna play Darktide like most of tomorrow.
[19716.90s -> 19719.50s]  Yeah, we'll play, we'll play some Darktide tomorrow.
[19719.50s -> 19720.99s]  Yeah, we should definitely play.
[19720.99s -> 19722.39s]  Yeah.
[19722.39s -> 19723.23s]  Okay, I'll see you then.
[19723.23s -> 19724.07s]  Thank you, Stu.
[19724.07s -> 19724.91s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[19724.91s -> 19725.75s]  It was a pleasure, Gemma.
[19725.75s -> 19726.59s]  No, it was great too.
[19726.59s -> 19730.78s]  I know we've played Darktide, but let's go.
[19730.78s -> 19731.62s]  Yeah.
[19731.62s -> 19732.82s]  All right, man.
[19732.82s -> 19733.66s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[19733.66s -> 19734.68s]  See you later.
[19734.68s -> 19736.98s]  Bye.
[19736.98s -> 19737.82s]  Yeah, more Darktide tomorrow.
[19737.82s -> 19739.06s]  I can't even talk.
[19739.06s -> 19741.87s]  More Darktide tomorrow.
[19741.87s -> 19746.86s]  It's gonna be sponsored, but that, I wonder.
[19747.78s -> 19750.63s]  Yeah, we'll probably just play Darktide tomorrow.
[19750.63s -> 19756.06s]  Darktide is the new Warhammer 40K co-op survival game.
[19756.86s -> 19759.74s]  It's fun.
[19759.74s -> 19762.44s]  Able to connect time out because the session ended.
[19762.44s -> 19763.28s]  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[19763.28s -> 19765.72s]  I actually didn't know what to expect going into this.
[19765.72s -> 19767.16s]  It was sort of a stir.
[19767.16s -> 19768.80s]  It was just like, hey,
[19768.80s -> 19771.48s]  do you wanna play this procedurally generated
[19771.48s -> 19774.92s]  kind of RPG DND game that just makes random stuff happen?
[19774.92s -> 19777.44s]  And it's like, sure, why not?
[19777.44s -> 19779.48s]  Hope it was fun to watch.
[19779.48s -> 19783.58s]  It was fun to do.
[19783.58s -> 19785.06s]  You were lost the entire time.
[19785.06s -> 19785.90s]  Yeah.
[19786.74s -> 19788.71s]  I think that's part of it, though.
[19788.71s -> 19792.83s]  It was definitely funny, but I hope you enjoyed it.
[19792.83s -> 19797.47s]  Yeah, so tomorrow we're doing a Warhammer, Darktide,
[19797.47s -> 19802.50s]  and then the day after that, Austin Show and I,
[19802.50s -> 19807.08s]  I'm gonna be on Austin's stream, gonna be in a big,
[19807.08s -> 19809.98s]  we're gonna be doing a flight simulator.
[19809.98s -> 19812.62s]  I have no idea what to expect.
[19812.62s -> 19818.55s]  I am, I wanna say, hopefully prepared.
[19818.55s -> 19821.93s]  It's gonna be a pretty wild experience, so.
[19821.93s -> 19824.70s]  If you don't, obviously go follow Austin's channel.
[19824.70s -> 19827.94s]  It'll be on Austin Show's channel.
[19827.94s -> 19834.94s]  Looking forward to it, should be fun.
[19834.94s -> 19836.59s]  Bring sorcery back.
[19836.59s -> 19838.87s]  Yeah, I know, and I told you this before,
[19838.87s -> 19843.22s]  but I do like these.
[19843.22s -> 19846.00s]  I mean, this is, I wouldn't call this a chill stream,
[19846.00s -> 19850.52s]  but it kind of was.
[19850.52s -> 19852.82s]  We're gonna do way more chill streams,
[19852.82s -> 19853.74s]  where we just kind of play something
[19853.74s -> 19857.82s]  and just hang out.
[19857.82s -> 19860.90s]  Breath of the Wild, yeah.
[19860.90s -> 19863.99s]  This was more chill than Miku Picross.
[19863.99s -> 19865.19s]  I think there was a,
[19865.19s -> 19867.47s]  I would say this was a little high energy at some points,
[19867.47s -> 19870.32s]  but it was just kind of playing, it was fun.
[19870.32s -> 19873.82s]  But that's it, I will see you guys later.
[19873.82s -> 19875.22s]  Have a good rest of your night.
[19875.82s -> 19880.49s]  Yeah, that's a perfect place to call it here.
[19880.49s -> 19884.72s]  Thanks for watching, everybody.
[19884.72s -> 19894.26s]  That was Wilder Myth.
[19894.26s -> 19896.14s]  Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[19896.14s -> 19900.46s]  See you tomorrow.
[19900.46s -> 19908.60s]  Thanks for supporting the stream, always.
[19908.60s -> 19914.09s]  You know Otto?
[19914.09s -> 19920.50s]  You'll see Otto soon.
[19920.50s -> 19923.94s]  But yeah, Darktide tomorrow, probably starting around,
[19923.94s -> 19925.34s]  what time?
[19925.34s -> 19926.34s]  That's a good question.
[19926.34s -> 19934.49s]  Not as early as this started, but not super late.
[19934.49s -> 19940.43s]  When, let me see, when should it be?
[19940.43s -> 19941.55s]  I don't know, maybe it'll probably,
[19941.55s -> 19947.22s]  I wanna play a little bit later in the evening, maybe.
[19947.22s -> 19950.02s]  Maybe start around, I don't know,
[19950.02s -> 19950.86s]  just keep an eye on Sus.
[19950.86s -> 19952.30s]  I don't wanna start too late.
[19952.30s -> 19955.72s]  Maybe like two, maybe two, three.
[19955.72s -> 19959.54s]  Let's just say three.
[19959.54s -> 19962.14s]  And I'm gonna try to make it for two.
[19962.14s -> 19965.42s]  I also don't want to have it be too late
[19965.42s -> 19969.74s]  because I wanna miss the 7.30 internet crash
[19969.74s -> 19974.14s]  that usually happens.
[19974.14s -> 19976.34s]  So that sounds like a good time to start.
[19976.34s -> 19982.26s]  Two, three o'clock, specific obviously.
[19982.26s -> 19984.25s]  Yeah, take care of yourselves.
[19984.25s -> 19985.49s]  Thanks for watching.
[19985.49s -> 19990.26s]  Thanks to, you know, thanks to the boys.
[19990.26s -> 19996.22s]  We'll see them tomorrow.
[19996.22s -> 19997.95s]  Take care of yourselves.
[19997.95s -> 20000.69s]  Good night, goodbye.
[20000.69s -> 20005.70s]  As always, call your mother, you know.
[20005.70s -> 20006.54s]  See you tomorrow.
