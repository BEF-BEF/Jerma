[0.50s -> 9.37s]  Good afternoon. I'm getting this crazy, crazy revelation right now. I'm using,
[9.37s -> 21.93s]  for the first time, I'm using Streamlabs OBS. This is 500,000 times better than just using standard
[22.49s -> 30.52s]  OBS. I didn't even know this stuff was going to happen until I pressed live. Let me just go
[30.52s -> 38.02s]  over it. Let me paint you a picture here. So the chat is here in the program. The live monitor is
[38.02s -> 47.56s]  here in the program. The recent events, Streamlabs bits and subs and everything's over here. I used
[47.56s -> 57.99s]  to have like 12 windows out on my monitors. This shit's all in one program? That's unbelievable.
[61.16s -> 69.32s]  Anyways, hi. How are you? I'm Jeremy. Do I sound louder too? I played around with some audio
[69.32s -> 80.95s]  settings. This is post carnival germa. I'm all about the production value now. I may have screwed
[80.95s -> 95.54s]  up a few settings, but I'm all about making productions like this one. Where's the loud
[95.54s -> 103.82s]  wind? Not across the country anymore. I'm back in Vegas. Not only am I back in Vegas,
[104.54s -> 113.18s]  I have to get ready. I have to get ready to go to San Diego like tomorrow. Hey, I'm back. Hey,
[113.18s -> 125.19s]  back after the carnival. Bye. Going to TwitchCon. Post carnival, pre TwitchCon. September was a
[125.19s -> 132.95s]  busy fucking month. Can I just tell you? Anyways, we can go over a few things here.
[133.51s -> 142.86s]  We're gonna hang out for a little bit. Just enough time to go over stuff that I couldn't really do
[142.86s -> 148.68s]  at the end of that other stream because we had to tear that whole thing down. Had to leave. I had
[148.68s -> 158.87s]  a birthday to celebrate too. This is the exact game I was hoping you would play. I'm gonna try
[158.87s -> 167.59s]  it. I got a lot of requests to play this. So what's the game? Like two, three hours long or something?
[168.57s -> 179.26s]  Easy. But if you didn't know, I just saw this the other day. Let me put a link for you.
[180.31s -> 187.69s]  The goats, the Andy Mark goats. I didn't even know they were gonna do this. They are on sale
[187.69s -> 193.72s]  right now. The ones that were in the machine. You can buy a goat that was apparently on camera.
[194.71s -> 203.06s]  I don't know how many of these they have. They might have very few amount of these. I don't know
[203.06s -> 219.78s]  how many. Copy and paste. There you go. If you read and see these. The goats were special invited
[219.78s -> 224.26s]  guests to the recent Twitch carnival in partnership with German 95. Together we put on this the first
[224.26s -> 228.18s]  robotic carnival where viewers at home banded together to control the robots playing games.
[228.66s -> 231.70s]  You've been asking when there'll be available purchases today is that they each goat in our
[231.70s -> 238.34s]  inventory was on stream in the claw machine when they're gone they're gone. I don't know how many
[238.34s -> 247.64s]  were in there. I don't know if this is one per customer. Hopefully, hopefully if you want one
[247.64s -> 256.36s]  you can get one. Do just chatting. We need to catch up. That's what I plan on doing. We're not
[256.36s -> 263.19s]  just gonna jump right into goose game. I have to remember how to stream. It's been a while. Hold on.
[263.19s -> 270.06s]  Speaking of speaking of forgetting how to live stream like from a desk plus I of course I did
[270.06s -> 277.35s]  the first one. I'm like let me let me set up stream labs OBS. I'll give you one sec. I didn't
[277.35s -> 329.53s]  even tweet this either. Hold on. Every single one of my USB slots is taken up now. That's not good.
[329.53s -> 340.14s]  I gotta figure out what the hell is even plugged in down here. How do I have? I have like 15 slots.
[340.86s -> 346.98s]  That makes no sense. All right. Let me figure out how to add my camera now.
[347.78s -> 357.18s]  Uh oh. Oh shit. This is harder than I thought. Wait a minute. Hold on. Add. There we go. I think
[359.11s -> 371.86s]  add a camera. No. This one here. Yeah. Okay. This one looks all right. Is it working? Can you guys
[371.86s -> 390.02s]  see me? No. Why does it look like this? Why does it look like this? Why does it look like this?
[393.10s -> 401.75s]  Is this a? Did I fuck this up? Oh from the left. From the last stream. That's right. Hold on.
[402.31s -> 414.28s]  Hold on. Let me fix my peasant hair. I'm not going to fix my peasant hair. It's not going to happen.
[414.28s -> 418.04s]  I got a haircut for TwitchCon and I ended up making myself look like a dickhead.
[418.60s -> 422.49s]  So it looks like we're going with a hat this time. How do I fix this?
[434.22s -> 446.12s]  Why does this still look wrong? Is it doing anything? I gotta really I gotta learn how to
[446.12s -> 454.04s]  use this program. That's gonna take a little while. Anyways let me uh kill the audio here.
[454.04s -> 457.64s]  How do I crop in Streamlabs? Everybody know how to crop in Streamlabs? What do you do?
[459.56s -> 466.47s]  It's not alt. It should be alt. I've never used it before. How do you crop in Streamlabs?
[469.21s -> 475.19s]  Show Werelord. Show Werelord. I gotta I got a story for you about Werelord. Okay. Werelord
[476.28s -> 484.55s]  was a huge pain in the ass to take home. Uh hold on. I let me just hold on. Let me tweet this. I'll
[484.55s -> 582.31s]  be right back. Okay. Yeah I've got I've got a story to tell you about this guy.
[583.19s -> 592.90s]  It's not even really a story. It's just a series of annoyances. Even right now. Even now. Even now
[592.90s -> 601.72s]  he's a pain in the ass. Okay look. I there's no way he can go. He's such an awkward like big sausage
[601.72s -> 610.92s]  hot dog shape. Uh this was my personal item on the plane. I took a carry-on obviously and this
[610.92s -> 616.44s]  was my personal item. But there's nowhere for him to go. There's no I was gonna put backpack
[616.44s -> 624.02s]  straps on this thing. But listen do you know how hard it is to carry this around like this
[624.02s -> 629.86s]  in an airport? Just like dragging around. I felt like um who's the Charlie Brown character that
[629.86s -> 634.66s]  has the blanket? I was like dragging him on the ground trying to go to the bathroom with this
[634.66s -> 641.22s]  thing too. I went into the bathroom and I balanced him stuck him through the the handle of the
[641.22s -> 647.40s]  suitcase trying to drag him and balance him and we got it. I had to go into a stall. I couldn't
[647.72s -> 651.85s]  am I gonna hold him like this and piss? People would think I was a fucking weirdo.
[652.86s -> 658.22s]  I had to go into a stall and slowly like this like balance him on the top of my suitcase
[659.02s -> 667.35s]  and he like fell on the public bathroom ground like three times. People were commenting on it too.
[667.99s -> 675.78s]  I told you he was gonna be here. I know that you know where he was. He was in the laundry room
[675.78s -> 680.54s]  because he needed to be cleaned. He was disgusting and I just put my hands all over him again.
[682.57s -> 689.96s]  Ah but it was hard to take take it around and there was actually a few times you know when
[689.96s -> 696.20s]  you're walking by um you're in the airport and you see those big fucking trash cans.
[697.24s -> 703.40s]  Man after trying to finagle him for like 30-40 straight minutes it got real close for me just
[703.40s -> 715.10s]  like dropping him in the trash. It was really close. It was so frustrating or I was gonna just be I
[715.10s -> 721.03s]  was gonna be like find somebody and be like here do you want like this toy? But then I was like
[721.03s -> 728.02s]  that's fucked up too. That's kind of that's it's weird. Hey hey do you want this toy? And then I
[728.02s -> 732.28s]  thought they were gonna like cut it open because I'm trying to bring like drugs. That was another
[732.28s -> 738.12s]  thing that was going racing through my mind. Oh yeah just me with this uh yeah Wailord's my favorite
[738.12s -> 744.20s]  Pokemon. Don't worry he's just a perfectly perfectly large enough to store like eight
[744.20s -> 750.34s]  pounds of cocaine. Let me just I'm just taking him with me. Don't worry it's kids toy. That was
[750.34s -> 766.42s]  a fucking whole lord deal. Drug Wailord. Wail Drug Lord. Anyways I'm back. Uh I had a birthday too.
[766.98s -> 770.90s]  I saw a lot of wonderful things. I'm not even I'm not in the wrong I'm in the wrong category.
[771.46s -> 776.10s]  Let me change this to just chatting because that's where I'm supposed to be.
[777.80s -> 790.50s]  Why is my intro still playing? Get out of here. There we go. No not jump. Jump ultimate stars.
[790.50s -> 806.68s]  Just chatting. Okay how do I make this bigger? It's just gonna look like this. I'm sorry. You
[806.68s -> 813.38s]  guys just have to deal with how stupid this looks. No not that. This is fine. It's fine. I don't care.
[814.18s -> 822.44s]  Anyways uh bits bits just came in. Did they? Hold on. Let me change my streamlabs thing.
[824.50s -> 838.12s]  Is it like am I too wide? Is that right? What came in? Where? Huge bits. I don't see huge bits.
[839.86s -> 847.69s]  Where do you see them? Wider. Oh we got them. We debated them. Now let's talk about this.
[848.81s -> 853.53s]  By the way again if you want Andy Mark Goat there's good luck because you probably they're
[853.53s -> 860.68s]  gonna sell out in probably 15 minutes. Or they have or there's more that was in there that I
[860.68s -> 869.56s]  didn't know of. They're already gone. Are they actually already gone? No they're not are they?
[869.56s -> 889.02s]  I think they're still there. He ignored 500 bucks. There's not 500 dollars here. Did you
[889.02s -> 894.66s]  donate that of the money to charity? No not yet. I have not been home for more than a day or two so
[896.78s -> 902.70s]  and I had to celebrate my birthday. This is the first day of like existing that you guys are
[902.70s -> 920.87s]  seeing. You just got paid for the drugs that you smuggled. Birthday money. Did somebody say I
[920.87s -> 935.50s]  ignored Joel earlier? Is Joel here? Did I did I miss Joel? Well what's up? No it was it was a
[935.50s -> 940.52s]  great time and it was an immense success I think. There was a couple of hiccups. The robot you
[940.52s -> 945.59s]  actually guys you actually really did break the robot like twice. You can always tell when the
[945.59s -> 951.75s]  robot got broken when they would just hand me a microphone and say hey the robot's uh fucked up
[951.75s -> 958.39s]  like you gotta kill time and I'm just like sitting there like okay so uh nice we've got uh something
[958.39s -> 964.39s]  else coming up here uh I was doing a lot of lip licking too because it was so windy I watched like
[964.39s -> 970.95s]  two or three clips right and I'm just going like what am I doing with my mouth this shit was so

[1116.01s -> 1124.34s]  that's a shitload of money that's you are racking up okay you're at the hotel and you asked the hotel
[1124.90s -> 1130.90s]  to bring in seven or eight extra TVs and they wheeled them all in you plugged them all in and
[1130.90s -> 1137.24s]  you bought like 40 pawns on every single one of those TVs and just played them well you weren't

[1202.41s -> 1211.93s]  and and trident jacks gave 50 dollars much love thank thank you all for the werelord but we
[1213.53s -> 1218.09s]  not to completely jump past that that's a shitload of money but we brought the wind
[1218.09s -> 1221.85s]  brought by my like lip licking because the wind was just we really thought we were going to have
[1221.85s -> 1227.37s]  to cancel the event it was so like 10 20 minutes before 30 minutes before that the stream started
[1227.37s -> 1234.01s]  we were getting these huge ass gusts and we were just sitting around going oh no no this is not
[1234.01s -> 1237.77s]  this is very bad we would have rather had brain because we would have pulled everything
[1237.77s -> 1243.90s]  towards uh inside because there was a place inside we could do it wherever I was the most
[1243.90s -> 1248.06s]  nervous concerning there's a knot in my stomach is the wind going to knock all these games over
[1248.06s -> 1252.86s]  and ruin the whole day it was that was a last second call because there were a couple times
[1252.86s -> 1255.74s]  during that stream when I really thought the whole booth was going to blow over
[1256.62s -> 1261.43s]  wind is like hitting me in the face it was all over the place uh ignored joel hold on wait a

[1379.56s -> 1383.80s]  and then filled it with water so it's a pineapple juice concentrate that i turned into a hydrating
[1383.80s -> 1397.10s]  liquid it was not dish water soap uh anyways that was some of the most fun i think i've ever had
[1397.10s -> 1403.34s]  especially even like on stream that once we got going and after like 45 minutes or so and it was
[1403.34s -> 1409.45s]  very clear that the wind wasn't going to destroy everything that was so much fun and something
[1409.45s -> 1418.92s]  else that you guys really need to know uh this this ain't ending here we are already already
[1418.92s -> 1425.82s]  talking about the next one so that's not oh that was the carnival that was really cool uh
[1426.84s -> 1433.29s]  we'll never see anything like that again no you sooner than you think this shit ain't going to
[1433.29s -> 1439.54s]  have anything to do with the carnival either we're stepping on the gas here guys i'm just holding
[1439.54s -> 1448.44s]  it down and i'm gonna hold the gas pedal down until the car is out of gas and then i'm walking
[1448.44s -> 1455.99s]  too and then when i'm done walking when my legs give up from the fucking dehydration i'm gonna
[1455.99s -> 1476.76s]  crawl you understand and then when i'm done crawling when i'm out of complete energy and i
[1476.76s -> 1494.20s]  am not of dessert anymore as a fucking ghost keep going and no i we're gonna we're going
[1494.84s -> 1500.81s]  there's way more to see if you think that's it that's not even close
[1500.81s -> 1514.01s]  that was a test and i and i think i passed i think i passed the test i only almost got hurt four
[1514.01s -> 1525.93s]  times that's not a big deal it's okay we've got more robotic streams that we've been thinking of
[1525.93s -> 1533.42s]  just going back and forth just it was the whole team just clicked all the all the people at
[1534.06s -> 1541.02s]  were so awesome they were super super nice had a bunch of great ideas themselves that all that
[1541.02s -> 1546.38s]  that wasn't just all me guys like they had to come up with most of that shit because they were the
[1546.38s -> 1553.80s]  ones that had to make the fucking robot so i was extreme overlord this is what i want this is how
[1553.80s -> 1557.64s]  i want it to work this is the joke that i want to do i want this joke i want that to happen i want
[1557.64s -> 1562.20s]  that to happen and these guys just absolutely fucking killed it like it was it was unbelievable
[1562.20s -> 1568.60s]  i couldn't have asked for a better team so there was a lot of people that worked on that stuff and
[1568.60s -> 1574.28s]  there they were very very very adamant and excited to work together again in the future
[1574.28s -> 1582.81s]  so i could not have gotten a better group of people can you share anything that did not make
[1582.81s -> 1595.00s]  the stream um i'm trying to think there's anything that that didn't get in there every all like the
[1595.00s -> 1599.72s]  weird fucked up shit that i wanted to do got in the stream but that we made sure this but we just
[1599.72s -> 1608.36s]  like three or four months in the making so we had lots of time to prepare for it and lots of time
[1608.36s -> 1621.30s]  to care about it the feet cam the feet cam was scripted it was not in fact a lot of the things
[1621.30s -> 1626.26s]  that i think you guys think were scripted were not at all me getting hit in the face by the frog
[1627.58s -> 1635.50s]  that was i could i actually couldn't i could not believe you did i said it hit me in the face and
[1635.50s -> 1640.78s]  you guys hit me in the face and it was not just i didn't move to like get hit by it it wasn't like
[1640.78s -> 1645.58s]  oh there it is i'm gonna like okay uh three two i can see the timer okay get in the way and like
[1645.58s -> 1651.48s]  get hit by it no no i didn't move you guys hit me right in the fucking nose i stood completely
[1651.48s -> 1662.68s]  still when you fired that thing it hit me directly in the face uh what are some moments there were
[1662.68s -> 1667.93s]  some moments that felt scripted well the clowns were scripted because they they had to be and
[1667.93s -> 1679.77s]  they were awesome too oh those those clowns were unbelievable bring them back that's gonna be tough
[1681.29s -> 1690.50s]  because they're across the country procedurally generated clown content we gave them an idea of
[1690.50s -> 1696.87s]  what we wanted and then they just they just kind of hit the ground running and did whatever they
[1696.87s -> 1712.26s]  fucking felt like and it was great those clowns was the clowns were scary move in with the clowns
[1713.06s -> 1719.78s]  what would you guys do if i just went come on in and they both just came in and i got up walked
[1719.78s -> 1727.02s]  out of the room and they just did a fucking two-hour routine it was i felt uncomfortable
[1734.70s -> 1747.05s]  yeah well i'm sorry i'm sorry but it was great give us our prizes uh you got the the workloads
[1747.05s -> 1759.03s]  right here but twitchcon is this weekend i know at least a few of the people that were that were
[1759.03s -> 1765.18s]  part of the event are going to be there we're going to brainstorm some more stuff we were talking
[1765.18s -> 1775.11s]  about and i don't want to give away any spoilers in fact i won't but i want i want the next one
[1776.86s -> 1786.09s]  to be somewhere either in january or february of 2020 the next stream like that you will see
[1786.09s -> 1793.54s]  it in somewhere i'm hoping between december and february faster i can get done the better
[1796.86s -> 1802.41s]  early yeah i want to do this every few months every three or four months i want to do something
[1802.41s -> 1809.78s]  like that because that's fun to me that's it just i just that's that's what i care about at this
[1809.78s -> 1818.47s]  point and now the team exists there they are ready and they are willing and they were just like
[1819.35s -> 1826.92s]  whatever you come up with let's fucking go it's like dude i have i have i have fucking nightmares
[1826.92s -> 1837.03s]  and dreams every single night with new scenarios so we're not gonna run out of those but it was
[1837.11s -> 1842.50s]  something that was cut nope i wrote up everything you see on that stream i've
[1842.50s -> 1850.10s]  written down on a piece of paper you know series of napkins i was at it was at chili's and just
[1850.10s -> 1854.90s]  wrote like an crayon a series of things that i wanted to do and you know every bullet point
[1854.90s -> 1861.14s]  every piece everything that i wanted and sent it off to the producer producer said can we make
[1861.14s -> 1875.51s]  this happen the rest is uh history too many napkins ordered off the kids menu no ordering
[1875.51s -> 1884.76s]  off the kids menu at a chili's you honestly may as well just go to the grocery store and just get a
[1884.76s -> 1894.17s]  loaf of white bread and just eat it out of the bag this the same nutritional value so that way
[1894.17s -> 1898.25s]  we're still sub september isn't like chilies right like we're not gonna do like sub october and it's
[1898.25s -> 1911.27s]  chilies right am i gonna get i'm not i gotta stop talking shit about stuff mr luxury streamer
[1913.70s -> 1923.02s]  hold on a minute here i am not a luxury streamer i just don't like chilies you can be
[1923.02s -> 1935.70s]  non-luxury and not like chilies i don't think that's a very controversial opinion i mean
[1936.42s -> 1942.84s]  that being said the southwestern egg rolls are some of the finest they actually are pretty good
[1942.84s -> 1953.43s]  he's backtracking oh i gotta test my new my my audio compressor does it work you tell me ready
[1954.57s -> 1959.77s]  you should this should not get louder than like it too loud to listen to i'm gonna peek the mic
[1959.77s -> 1963.77s]  right now but it's not gonna peak this is a test i couldn't test before the stream started here we
[1963.77s -> 1977.93s]  go ah right that was okay that was that was fine right it didn't know it could there's no way it
[1977.93s -> 1987.14s]  could peak i have a limiter on now yeah is it distorting when i get this close when i go louder
[1987.14s -> 1994.70s]  than that does it distort that's what i need to know somebody just gave that was disgusting
[1994.70s -> 2003.86s]  somebody gave five it was uh durnu uh kaiser gave five community subs it did peak it's not possible
[2003.86s -> 2014.07s]  for it to peak i have a limiter set up right now let me prove it to you where's my audio where's
[2014.07s -> 2020.12s]  my audio monitoring device there it is all right hold on a second here so you tell me that you
[2020.12s -> 2030.68s]  said it's still it's still peaking your career is peaking okay see you in december and tell me
[2030.68s -> 2046.89s]  the same thing hey see it see in like december or january i want that guy to come back okay so
[2046.89s -> 2064.14s]  this is your career peaked at spi no that i there's no it did not oh mega lull true like true true
[2064.14s -> 2073.80s]  true just because that's your favorite thing doesn't mean that's where i peaked there is no
[2073.80s -> 2078.60s]  there is no peak i already told you i'm fucking i'm going on the gas until i have to walk at that
[2078.60s -> 2083.64s]  point the car would be when you peaked because then walking is much slower than driving and
[2083.64s -> 2089.85s]  crawling is slower than walking and when and when and when you're a ghost you don't have leg you
[2089.85s -> 2100.73s]  can't walk oh fuck this is not good what was i supposed to be doing oh right and i was testing
[2100.73s -> 2113.91s]  the limiter here all right i'm i can i can monitor this okay so uh hello i want to monitor this
[2114.79s -> 2122.10s]  is it working why is it not working is my computer fucked hello hello
[2122.90s -> 2137.06s]  hello hello hello hello hello i can't hear anything why i have lost audio on my computer
[2149.03s -> 2159.43s]  hello there we go this one shit's breaking okay uh no i can't peek i'm looking at it right now and
[2159.43s -> 2176.58s]  hear it oh no i can't okay not important so let's let's move on that's that was not important i
[2176.58s -> 2182.14s]  could have done that without being on camera so all right anyways what are you guys looking
[2182.14s -> 2199.32s]  you guys got a picture you want me to look at what is it oh like this what this is some kind
[2199.32s -> 2208.71s]  of surprise i guys guys i'm in this photo i i know this picture exists somebody didn't just
[2208.71s -> 2213.11s]  like sprint over to me and like make me stand next to that and then take a photo and run away
[2218.18s -> 2229.59s]  that's whatever how do i explain that i i mean what do you want me to explain that five six is
[2229.59s -> 2238.49s]  is like six six six eight look at the bars up top look that is bigger than a ceiling
[2239.05s -> 2247.78s]  or you think someone's who are those bars made for then all right if that's five six who are
[2247.78s -> 2268.07s]  the bars made for for children okay so you you think that what children like three feet tall
[2268.07s -> 2282.87s]  like how big are the people that are on that five six bars at five six doesn't know how tall kids
[2282.87s -> 2291.16s]  are yes i do the sign was incorrect and i was looking at it and then somebody took a picture
[2291.16s -> 2296.73s]  of it and they were laughing hysterically like their face was bright red laughing like wheezing
[2297.37s -> 2300.89s]  and i just kept going like i don't understand why i don't understand they got the picture and
[2300.89s -> 2305.69s]  they put they posted it they said could i just please post that picture and i was like yeah
[2310.74s -> 2322.42s]  four four six is like this tall that's like six i think that's like either six six
[2323.38s -> 2332.10s]  or that's like over that's almost seven feet tall look at the tree in the background is that tree
[2332.10s -> 2341.74s]  six feet tall i know that's a that's perspective i can't that's i can't prove it that way what does
[2341.74s -> 2351.38s]  it say stand up and hold a ruler no then i'll break the illusion that i'm some fucking goblin
[2352.79s -> 2358.07s]  that hunches over and carries like a backpack of gold around and i don't i don't want to break that
[2358.07s -> 2368.14s]  illusion that should have been pretty sick though if you had go that much gold everybody talk shit
[2368.14s -> 2372.30s]  about the goblet oh that yeah there goes the goblin with the goldenness in the knapsack
[2372.86s -> 2376.46s]  uh yeah that's worth like six or seven hundred million dollars like is that
[2378.47s -> 2385.16s]  you want to like talk down to the goblin with the fucking gigantic sack of gold they are they go
[2385.16s -> 2392.76s]  into their house like oh they slam it down and then they process it through like bank of america
[2393.56s -> 2399.53s]  and they get in their suit and their tie and then they go to fucking dinner the nicest restaurant
[2399.53s -> 2415.86s]  in the entire fucking city now he's projecting now he's projecting if you guys think i i you think i
[2415.86s -> 2425.35s]  own a suit no i don't you saw me with the only suit jacket i own on december 31st and it was too
[2425.35s -> 2430.07s]  small remember my arms were coming out of it i had that i've had that suit jacket since i was like
[2430.07s -> 2440.79s]  fucking i don't know 17 or something the new year stream yeah that's the only i know i think i don't
[2440.79s -> 2445.51s]  think i'm gonna have that anymore am i gonna play anything yeah yeah we're gonna play um
[2446.63s -> 2452.30s]  i'm just people wanted to hang out and talk for a little bit go over the the weekend and then
[2452.30s -> 2460.39s]  we're gonna play untitled goose game how do they make contact with andy mark it was a long process
[2461.69s -> 2466.65s]  those of you that don't know that stream i wanted to do that stream for about two years
[2468.55s -> 2475.27s]  it was so hard to try to find anybody that knew anything about robotics to that extent
[2477.85s -> 2484.65s]  because there's been plenty of you know twitch controls stuff on this site before obviously
[2484.65s -> 2487.77s]  twitch plays pokemon right that was the big one that was the first one wow this is crazy
[2488.33s -> 2496.41s]  the twitch controls this thing twitch moves that thing but never twitch can control a robot to that
[2496.41s -> 2502.73s]  size and that weight and that kind of device shooting like a ball out of it a real softball
[2502.73s -> 2510.33s]  not just like a little laser or a little um like action figure thing so anybody that
[2511.59s -> 2515.67s]  people at twitch i brought it up to people at twitch i had a partner manager at the time
[2516.23s -> 2519.75s]  and it was just like hey this is what i want to do i want to do like a little twitch dunk tank i'm
[2519.75s -> 2524.47s]  gonna do a carnival maybe and have like clowns and do some jokes and bring in some games and
[2524.47s -> 2528.87s]  some rides and stuff and they were like oh that sounds really cool and it was just a process of
[2528.87s -> 2535.51s]  trying to find the right person to connect to somebody that knew somebody who then could say
[2536.31s -> 2543.66s]  oh that sounds like a great idea and yes i work for a robotics company it was just tricky but
[2544.30s -> 2551.40s]  just through bouncing from person to person to person to person it went from my new partner
[2551.40s -> 2556.12s]  manager who without uh without my new partner manager this seriously this stream does not happen
[2557.13s -> 2563.93s]  they connected me to the first person necessary to be able to start the whole thing so without
[2563.93s -> 2578.63s]  that person it does not exist me no not me not you no um it really was a one guy scenario
[2579.50s -> 2588.44s]  and then i got linked up with um jk productions which was a production company that knew the
[2588.44s -> 2593.88s]  people at andy mark and through um various events and stuff and just somebody that knows
[2593.88s -> 2600.76s]  somebody that knows somebody that knows that person uh led to uh andy mark making these robots
[2601.48s -> 2606.52s]  and doing this whole thing the stream did the stream did cost a lot of money it did like i'm
[2606.52s -> 2610.84s]  i people have been wanting to know and i i'm not going to tell you a number because i don't think
[2610.84s -> 2621.11s]  it's necessary i don't think so but it it was some cash it was some it was some money because
[2621.11s -> 2624.71s]  there's no way that somebody could make those kind of things without trying to dish out a
[2624.71s -> 2628.95s]  little bit of money but i've said this before i said it a thousand times it was at least a dollar
[2628.95s -> 2640.06s]  yes it was 500 000 i said it on stream it was like 600 million no um i don't need to i don't
[2640.06s -> 2646.50s]  want to give a number because once once you start giving numbers then i don't know you start i don't
[2646.50s -> 2652.74s]  want anyone to feel like in this community holy shit oh they gave stuff but we gotta like refill
[2652.74s -> 2658.15s]  that i don't want that i don't want to come across like i'm saying oh you guys that was a lot of
[2658.15s -> 2667.70s]  money like oh that was a lot of you know i'm saying that was a lot of cash for me um it's
[2667.70s -> 2678.07s]  not necessary and i don't want any people it's it's easy to concern people right like hold on how
[2678.07s -> 2681.75s]  much money did you spend dude don't fucking do that anymore you don't have to do that don't do
[2681.75s -> 2686.20s]  what i actually when i told star star is one of the people that knows how much money this cost
[2686.84s -> 2695.42s]  and he he was like what the fuck are you doing he was like you are fucking crazy and i was like no
[2695.42s -> 2705.30s]  just don't like to know no i'm fine um remember the time when i muted everyone was like why did
[2705.30s -> 2718.23s]  you mute what did you guys talk about it was that but again this channel sees so much money
[2718.23s -> 2724.28s]  it does what you want to like pretend like it doesn't like i i don't i want to be completely
[2724.28s -> 2728.58s]  fucking see-through you know what i mean i don't want anyone to think you guys give a ton of
[2728.58s -> 2737.10s]  fucking money to the stream way more than i think some of you guys think so if i am going to i want
[2737.10s -> 2743.18s]  to do this i want to take whatever you guys give to this channel obviously i'm gonna i'm not going
[2743.18s -> 2748.94s]  to be like a total you know everything's for the stream obviously i want to try to have like a decent
[2749.66s -> 2755.26s]  living and have money for bills and money to put away and to save money and you guys
[2755.26s -> 2760.10s]  are doing that shit like you are that's where this comes from but that doesn't fucking matter
[2760.10s -> 2766.18s]  if i can take a large portion of this money and have a twitch controlled fucking carnival
[2767.14s -> 2772.20s]  that's what's going to happen every single fucking time if i'm able to do it
[2772.20s -> 2781.62s]  it's gonna happen every time he's obsessed with spending money stop talking about it you're gonna
[2781.62s -> 2789.59s]  regret it no there's no way how could i regret something like that it's not gonna happen
[2791.72s -> 2802.47s]  it was everything i wanted it to be so i just i just i can't i have no regrets and speaking of
[2802.47s -> 2815.98s]  money rvm thanks for the 5000 bits no yeah no i saw the card we talked i was in the pre-stream
[2815.98s -> 2835.34s]  we talked about it oh wait maybe did i didn't know i saw this one didn't i yeah i know that
[2835.34s -> 2839.82s]  yeah all the everyone contributing all the artwork and all the wonderful fucking sayings and messages
[2839.82s -> 2854.65s]  and everything for my birthday yeah yeah it's it's unfucking believable i i cannot words cannot
[2854.65s -> 2865.69s]  describe the feeling that you get when something like that comes in you know i'm saying every
[2865.69s -> 2872.89s]  message every piece of artwork it's made it's i'm 34 it's you know i didn't really do too much from
[2872.89s -> 2878.17s]  i mean i went out and uh and you know had a couple of drinks and stuff and just kind of chilled
[2878.73s -> 2886.18s]  it was a great time but when you get to be over 30 birthdays start to kind of become it's not like oh
[2886.18s -> 2895.94s]  i'm 18 i'm 21 i'm 25 i'm 30 it's kind of at this point that the ticker is just continuing to roll
[2896.58s -> 2905.62s]  so uh that's an incredibly special feeling to see something like this monkey ass what
[2907.53s -> 2911.05s]  what what are you talking about that's just the way it is how long am i i gotta cut these before
[2911.05s -> 2916.06s]  twitchcon remind me before the stream ends yeah look at these things these things gotta go
[2917.48s -> 2921.72s]  these are that these are kind of how long your nails are these are accidentally scratch your face
[2921.72s -> 2943.32s]  long nails but seriously so many people was like signed on this too this was a what i believe from
[2943.32s -> 2946.76s]  looking at the reddit thread about it and all the people that were posting stuff i mean this is a
[2946.76s -> 2954.39s]  multi-week thing to do so thank you everybody in the community that anything to do with this
[2957.46s -> 2964.79s]  it's good shit thank you but going back to what he's having a midlife crisis not till i'm 45
[2965.35s -> 2971.64s]  you know as long as i still look like this i mean i might i might get a little droopy i've already
[2971.64s -> 2978.86s]  started here if you go back this is interesting if you go back um go back like five or six years to
[2978.86s -> 2986.23s]  the youtube channel and go to a facecam video i don't have this it was like that i'm getting
[2986.23s -> 3000.39s]  a little droopy around the mouth here so you know it happens quick what did quick what he's turning
[3000.39s -> 3010.82s]  into bugleberry slowly grow a beard i can't grow a beard this is this is the extent of what i can
[3010.82s -> 3015.85s]  grow for a facial hair before i have to shave it before it looks embarrassing okay tell me if i'm
[3015.85s -> 3021.77s]  a weirdo am i weird let me explain let me explain this my i like the way that i look the most
[3022.63s -> 3030.74s]  when i've had two to three days of not shaving a fresh close shave i don't like the way that
[3030.74s -> 3039.34s]  i look right after it so during events for instance like twitchcon coming up i'm timing
[3039.34s -> 3044.70s]  every time about twitchcon the carnival stream oh i'm i've got a big party that i want to go to
[3044.70s -> 3051.10s]  oh i have this event that i have planned it oh and it's in it's in three days i time it so i shave
[3051.66s -> 3057.64s]  so then within two to three days i'm gonna show up to the twitchcon party and it's gonna be like
[3057.64s -> 3065.06s]  it's been two and a half full days exactly timed timed stubble and i'll be like hey what's up it's
[3065.06s -> 3070.47s]  me germa95 you know me everyone's gonna go i don't know no who the fuck are you and i'm gonna go
[3070.47s -> 3075.82s]  goodbye you know see what i got here i got like time stubble and they're gonna go i don't know
[3075.82s -> 3094.36s]  get away from me is that weird to time your stubble no a little a little and then i get really pissed
[3094.36s -> 3100.60s]  off and i miss time it by a little bit because it's three days it is like two and a half to the
[3100.60s -> 3108.25s]  third day if i miss time it and a fourth day goes by and then i go to the event no no we're all
[3108.25s -> 3113.99s]  fucked up now and it looks like shit and then i have to have the awkward conversation with myself
[3113.99s -> 3119.64s]  do you want to look a little dirty or do you want to look clean shave in the way that you don't like
[3119.64s -> 3125.78s]  oh it's hard okay how do i look right now it's like kind of scraggly i look a little dirty and
[3125.78s -> 3135.75s]  shit but i it's still all right just trim it no because i i've tried i have tried to trim when
[3135.75s -> 3142.70s]  you trim you end up doing this fuck you end up doing like patchy grass it's like mowing a lawn
[3142.70s -> 3147.66s]  you end up missing spaces and you have like scraggly hair and random spots i remember one
[3147.66s -> 3153.45s]  time it was so embarrassing i got an electric razor that had the trimmer on it and i was i was
[3153.45s -> 3158.81s]  at like five days no i gotta get this down to three so trying to get it down to three days
[3158.81s -> 3166.95s]  and it looked okay i got rolling on oh that looks all right right i get to where i was going
[3166.95s -> 3172.09s]  and nobody said anything i didn't know there was no hey whoa what the fuck's going on with your
[3172.09s -> 3177.26s]  neck no nobody said a damn thing i went to the bathroom and i was checking myself i'll just
[3177.26s -> 3180.86s]  making sure everything's going all right you know i've been there for an hour or two and then i went
[3180.86s -> 3191.78s]  like this and went like because i had these just spikes just black spikes sticking out of
[3191.86s -> 3198.17s]  random places in my neck because i didn't get them all the way it wasn't a beard it was just these
[3198.17s -> 3204.33s]  weird gross like hairs that were just poking out of a million different places so for the rest of
[3204.33s -> 3212.49s]  the night i was kind of like looking down like this i'm not at not extreme like that but you know
[3212.49s -> 3216.81s]  what i mean you end up just thinking and then you get the idea you go all right can i pluck all
[3216.81s -> 3221.82s]  these out in the mirror there was probably like 45 of them and i'm just like can i sit here and
[3221.82s -> 3228.52s]  pretend i'm taking a dump and just pluck all 45 of these with my bare hands you got i got like
[3228.52s -> 3236.95s]  two or three in and i was like that's not going to happen so i i don't do the trimmers anymore
[3236.95s -> 3244.31s]  try to take a five day down to a three no i just time it perfectly for instance this is like
[3244.31s -> 3254.73s]  embarrassing uh the twitch party is on saturday night so what am i going to do on wednesday night
[3254.73s -> 3265.46s]  thursday night friday night saturday night notice how i still haven't shaved see in like
[3266.10s -> 3278.84s]  four or five hours when i shave my fucking beard remember you need to chill out with this shit
[3278.84s -> 3297.14s]  all right well you you and my mother agree that's good no i i shaven's okay shave on stream
[3297.14s -> 3301.16s]  i won't i'll never do that i will never shave on stream you know how scary that is to do
[3302.12s -> 3308.94s]  i know guys i have i you know i also wouldn't stand outside on stream in a
[3309.82s -> 3315.58s]  field during a thunderstorm i'm not going to get struck by lightning it's not going to happen
[3315.58s -> 3319.90s]  it's raining out and this thunder and lightning outside i'm just going to stand outside like in
[3319.90s -> 3327.53s]  grass could i get struck by lightning make sure is there like a one zero point one point one percent
[3327.53s -> 3332.54s]  chance that it'll happen yeah i don't want to get struck by lightning on stream i don't want to be
[3332.54s -> 3339.06s]  shaving on stream and the zero point zero zero one percent chance that the blade is something
[3339.06s -> 3345.94s]  wrong with it or it's too dull or i i turn the wrong way and like i get a bad cut on my face like
[3345.94s -> 3351.86s]  on stream shaving because i shave with a safety razor i don't shave with like a Gillette like
[3351.86s -> 3358.97s]  just no i have i have a real blade i shave with a real blade i ain't gonna get struck by lightning
[3358.97s -> 3368.49s]  on stream stop having such a chad jawline it actually sucks because when you look at this
[3368.49s -> 3376.57s]  thing look at that's all bone like you can't shave over that look at this bone that's bone
[3376.57s -> 3394.42s]  that's bone so when i have a razor i have to i have to i have to like go around this big ass bone
[3394.42s -> 3398.74s]  and then you end up having like you your eyes you have to cross your eyes those of you that have like
[3398.74s -> 3406.42s]  big ass bones here right i have to go like this let's say you're the mirror i have to go like this
[3407.56s -> 3414.68s]  into the mirror i can't fucking see what i can't see i can barely fucking see what's happening
[3414.68s -> 3425.51s]  right now i'm just telling you i'm just telling you how it is Jeremy you look real old today
[3425.51s -> 3437.54s]  is it a birthday gag thanks but it's true it's true uh but i i used to shave and the reason why
[3437.54s -> 3442.42s]  i switched and i'm very careful like i'm not gonna fucking around when i tell you that uh i switched
[3442.42s -> 3448.92s]  from the guy to say don't listen to this bullshit all right this is more this is more like shit
[3448.92s -> 3453.40s]  talking of companies that will never sponsor me okay we don't do sponsors on this channel anyways
[3454.04s -> 3463.05s]  you don't it's time for the the six or seven blades in one day one two three four five six
[3463.05s -> 3468.25s]  seven eight nine all right you when you shave your face you shave with the first blade it gets the
[3468.25s -> 3474.58s]  big hairs the second blade gets the tiny hairs the third blade gets you don't need five fucking
[3474.58s -> 3481.46s]  blades you don't need like eight blades in one of those like and then they have like gel on them
[3481.46s -> 3492.50s]  what is this thing what happened to the goose game it's still happening we're still gonna do it
[3492.50s -> 3500.58s]  the blades get clogged up yeah you go down once and then you just got this like fucking mess in
[3500.58s -> 3508.70s]  there that you have to like dunk and like blow on it and like swish it around in water and they're
[3508.70s -> 3516.39s]  expensive do you know how cheap a razor blade is and you know how expensive would you go to cvs
[3516.39s -> 3524.79s]  and buy one of those fucking 16 blades with like the like the fucking sea salt gel that's all over
[3524.79s -> 3529.27s]  it and the fucking powder on the bottom you know how much money that is and you have to buy a new
[3529.27s -> 3544.22s]  one like every month it's really expensive i switched to just a safety razor so just raise it
[3544.22s -> 3548.94s]  the thing with the head you screw it on it's just a razor blade it's got two sides it's a one blade
[3548.94s -> 3554.76s]  two edges and as long as you're careful and you train yourself and you get tutorials on how to do
[3554.76s -> 3566.12s]  it i just kind of started doing it i am actually afraid to use the barber one you know it's what
[3566.12s -> 3572.55s]  i'm talking about the one that's like a switchblade it's like no no no i that to me that's like going
[3572.55s -> 3580.23s]  into the kitchen and grabbing a knife out of the drunk straight razors i can't do safety razor i
[3580.23s -> 3587.24s]  can't it's it's actually it's scary it is and i look i know there's a lot of people that use
[3587.24s -> 3593.91s]  straight razors and yeah you know i shave with a straight razor you know i do it's much cleaner
[3593.91s -> 3600.20s]  it's much better for you that person is terrified every time they use it internally they can tell
[3600.20s -> 3604.12s]  anybody that they use a straight razor they'll be in the mirror just going hope this ain't the
[3604.12s -> 3619.58s]  fucking day hope this ain't the day it's funny because even when i use a safety razor i say the
[3619.58s -> 3627.16s]  same thing i this is fine this is fine here here no this is very easy once i get down here
[3628.04s -> 3635.85s]  hope this ain't what hope this ain't the day okay it's not are you being a stand-up comedian
[3636.57s -> 3645.16s]  now is this an irl stream wax it off i actually thought about that before but that shit's
[3645.16s -> 3656.46s]  fucked that shit is worse talk more about beards i shaved the wrong way what are you talking about

[3691.10s -> 3710.01s]  chat right now that be careful when you use any sharp objects near your face that goes for
[3711.21s -> 3718.89s]  that goes for shaving razors that goes for toothpicks those of you that chew on toothpicks
