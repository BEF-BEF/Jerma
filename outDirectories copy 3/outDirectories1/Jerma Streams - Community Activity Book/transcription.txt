[0.57s -> 9.03s]  I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. I'm here. I made it. I just had to pee. I was here.
[9.03s -> 23.22s]  I just peed. You didn't. I did. I don't know, those have been making me real irritated lately.
[23.22s -> 28.66s]  Like just today. Only today. Usually I like, I like don't give a shit at all about that. And it's
[28.66s -> 34.15s]  like, okay, it's funny. It's the rumor that that person has driven by here like 12 times in the
[34.15s -> 40.76s]  last like six minutes. And after 10 is when you start to be like, all right, like, can
[41.48s -> 47.82s]  can you just get to where you're going? It's what is your destination at this point?
[52.58s -> 59.46s]  It's at this point, I'm convinced that you're on an AI path. And like, what do I need to go out there
[59.46s -> 70.28s]  and like activate the cutscene or something? So am I missing my cue? Anyway, yes, yes, yes.
[70.92s -> 80.79s]  Anyways, today we are going to do something that I've been talking about for a while.
[81.59s -> 94.79s]  We're going to do the community activities. Dot to dots. Spot the differences. Where's Waldo?
[94.79s -> 106.50s]  Except it's me. Funny stories that the community has written. And then so, right. Now I have a lot
[106.50s -> 117.83s]  of these. There are, I believe, 45 dot to dot activities. I think there are 10. Where's Waldo's?
[117.83s -> 124.10s]  I think there are 10 spot the difference activities. And there are about two to three
[124.10s -> 130.06s]  hundred stories and jokes. So I don't think we're going to be able to get through all of those
[130.62s -> 142.55s]  today because I have to, I have to get on an airplane. This is the last stream you're going
[142.55s -> 151.70s]  to see from me until the carnival. This is going to be just a chill, relaxing, hey everybody, let's
[152.26s -> 160.63s]  let's just chill like yesterday. This is the last time you're going to see me until it turns on
[161.43s -> 167.91s]  and you're at the carnival. So without further ado, let me make sure I look okay.
[178.94s -> 185.70s]  Is he saying goodbye? I'm saying goodbye for like four days. It's not really not even that big of a
[185.70s -> 192.63s]  deal considering, like guys, I've taken, I've taken like four or five days off in a row
[193.51s -> 198.07s]  just like randomly before. So I'm acting like, oh it's the last time you're going to see me in four
[198.07s -> 211.96s]  days. I took like a full week off like two months ago. What am I talking about? It's all good.
[212.68s -> 215.83s]  Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce to you
[216.81s -> 223.46s]  first segment of our stream this afternoon. Let me, let me actually get on camera for the first
[223.46s -> 244.36s]  time in a long time and I actually like took a shower today. So, hey, he looks fresh. Oh,
[244.36s -> 255.53s]  wait, wait, wait. I should get a haircut pretty recently. So let's get a greasy forehead. I have
[255.53s -> 261.59s]  oily combination skin. So good. Yeah. You and my doctor have something in common. You both know
[261.59s -> 274.63s]  that. Great. Cool. Oh, it's, it's Otto. Everybody. Okay. Let me tell you something. Everybody that
[274.63s -> 283.61s]  has a dog. If you do not over the course of your life, get a mug with your dog on it. I mean,
[283.61s -> 303.02s]  are you, are you really like a true dog owner? I'm not sure. Look at this shit. This is the first
[303.02s -> 310.73s]  one we're going to do. There are a lot of these. So if you don't know how a dot to dot works,
[313.03s -> 319.19s]  what could this be? Yeah, I know. A dot to dot is you have to start at one with your finger on the,
[319.19s -> 323.75s]  with the pencil, right? And you got to go, for instance, I'm not going to be zoomed in for these
[323.75s -> 329.02s]  because that's cheating. So you go one, two to three to four to five. You guys know how to do
[329.02s -> 335.88s]  this. It's very self-explanatory. I've got a, I've got an application here that is a really,
[335.88s -> 341.56s]  really neat thing. I can draw all over the screen. I can draw whatever I want. See what I mean?
[342.71s -> 347.75s]  And this is not on my computer. This is, this is a virtual machine. This is a virtual painting
[347.75s -> 355.06s]  machine. I can, I can, I can clear it. I can save it. It's pretty good technology.
[355.70s -> 360.73s]  I fucked it up. No, I just told you that I have a virtual painting technology thing.
[362.76s -> 373.18s]  I could go like this. He ruined it. You went, what'd you say? Microsoft paint? No,
[373.18s -> 379.35s]  this isn't Microsoft paint. I don't remember what this application is called, but it's actually,
[379.35s -> 386.71s]  yes, I do. I only know what this thing is called because of it has this name. I believe this
[386.71s -> 396.12s]  application is called Epic Pen. I think that is, that's actually what this is called. All right,
[396.12s -> 400.36s]  so let's get started. I think many people have trickled in now. People know this is going on.
[403.19s -> 410.65s]  It's a smart board. No, it's an Epic Pen. So let's go with the pencil and we already know
[410.65s -> 416.49s]  what this one is. I mean, come on, give me a break. See, I'm going to fuck these up.
[417.67s -> 425.75s]  That's be aware of that. I will screw at least half of these up. A little down here. One, two,
[425.75s -> 437.74s]  three, four, five, six, seven. Ooh, it's getting tricky down here. Here comes a jump scare.
[446.97s -> 456.74s]  Okay. Seven, eight, nine, 10. I got colors here. I can change colors. What color is,
[456.74s -> 461.80s]  wait, I have to change. What color is fireman's face? Fire. Oh, it's yellow. I fucked it all up
[461.80s -> 480.30s]  already. Clear it. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Whoa, it's getting weird.
[480.30s -> 490.55s]  It's going in a circle. 22, 23. Don't go that way. Don't go that way. 24, 25, 20. Whoa, whoa,
[494.10s -> 507.45s]  is it a trick? No, it's not a trick. This is the fire. This is the fire. Right. Okay. This is the
[507.45s -> 517.24s]  fire. That was, that was cool. All right. Cool. Nice work. Six, seven, 28, 29, 30.
[518.04s -> 531.26s]  And we go up where it gives the flame. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. All the way up here. Here. This is
[531.26s -> 552.98s]  pretty good. Two, and wrap it across to 53. First one is done. Look at how happy he looks.
[556.28s -> 563.59s]  Very, very good. That one was easy. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. Oh, let me tell you.
[563.59s -> 566.87s]  Jerma starts at half of his sentences, but let me tell you. Let me tell you something. Let me tell
[566.87s -> 574.55s]  you. Somebody, some of you guys decided to, I guess, be funny. And there were a bunch of
[574.55s -> 579.94s]  these in here that were just like triangles, just like one, two, three, and like a square.
[580.58s -> 587.93s]  Like that, that ain't, that ain't going to show up on stream. That's it. There's the first one.
[587.93s -> 596.42s]  That's fireman. While I do this, I'm going to put on some stories. Just, I want to, we've got to
[596.42s -> 601.62s]  get the first one done. I got to show you how it works. So I'm going to put on some stories now.
[602.18s -> 612.66s]  These are the stories that people have written. And yes, when I say I'm putting on the stories,
[613.78s -> 617.06s]  I'm literally, I'm literally going to have text to speech save them too,
[617.06s -> 632.82s]  because I've got to concentrate on this shit. Here we go. I was walking down the street the other day
[632.82s -> 637.14s]  and noticed something weird on the sidewalk. Something weird on the side. It looked like
[637.14s -> 642.74s]  nothing I had ever seen before. As I got closer, I could feel something emitting from it.
[643.54s -> 649.38s]  I grabbed the handle and pulled as hard as I could and a burnt crisp of a man fell out.
[649.38s -> 656.14s]  Thank you. Good lady. He said, I have been locked inside that walk in oven for days.
[656.14s -> 660.62s]  He then face planted so hard that he turned to dust and disappeared.
[660.62s -> 667.13s]  Okay. I got to pay attention. I haven't seen him since. Elizabeth L from Stockholm, Sweden,
[667.13s -> 672.33s]  closing square bracket. I saw German at a grocery store in Boston yesterday.
[673.21s -> 678.33s]  I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him
[678.33s -> 684.09s]  and ask him for photos or anything. Oh, he said, oh, like you're doing now. Right.
[684.09s -> 690.02s]  Closing square bracket. Back when army of two first came out, me and my college roommates,
[690.02s -> 697.14s]  sweetmates were all way too into halo three to really care. I didn't even think army of two was
[697.14s -> 705.05s]  on my radar in 2008. My college sweetmates would sneak into my room while I wasn't there and play
[705.05s -> 711.45s]  halo three without my permission on my Xbox. But more importantly, they would look at my DVD
[711.45s -> 718.92s]  collection. I had like 215 DVDs in alphabetical order and they would pay thanks for the five
[718.92s -> 724.52s]  dollars where they would move to random titles in different places and see how long it would take
[724.52s -> 731.34s]  me to notice. Yeah, I know that says a lot more about me than it does about them, but I could tell
[731.34s -> 737.64s]  every time that was the joke. I would just scan briefly over my DVDs every day and see if they
[737.64s -> 742.84s]  had taken one was usually the issue wasn't I wasn't checking to see if they put them out of order.
[742.84s -> 747.58s]  I was checking because they would turn up missing. This is your only opportunity you're ever going
[747.58s -> 754.06s]  to hear and find someone across the hallway who borrowed one without asking. And what do you know?
[754.06s -> 762.47s]  The DVD is missing from inside of its jewel case. Where did it go? No one knows. Oh, I found it.
[762.55s -> 768.26s]  It's in two pieces now. No, I'm not still angry about that. Is this part is this still closing
[768.26s -> 773.74s]  square bracket? No closing square bracket. There was once a man at an airport without a passport.
[773.74s -> 780.20s]  He was making a sound like a snort unable to retort. Good. As a last resort, he tried to act
[780.20s -> 788.18s]  like an athlete for a sport. He landed in a court which to him was like a resort. Taking public
[788.18s -> 795.72s]  transport, he went to a port. For his to port his height was listed which by all accounts was short.
[795.72s -> 801.74s]  Closing square bracket. One time at a friend's house I was hungry and looted his pan. How do
[801.74s -> 809.10s]  you talk? How do you speak with a TTS stream? I can't talk. This person's streaming for me.
[809.10s -> 819.22s]  Bear in mind two factors. This the robot is streaming for me. I can't even talk to you guys.
[819.22s -> 831.98s]  Hey, what's up? One time at a friend's house I was hungry and looted his pantry for something to eat.
[831.98s -> 836.38s]  I found a jar of what I had assumed to be homeless and attempted to open it. Oh,
[836.38s -> 841.90s]  you never do. Bear in mind two factors. I had a brand new shirt on and the lid on the jar still
[841.90s -> 848.49s]  had the sealing plastic on it. I used my shirt as a way to get extra grip against the protest
[848.49s -> 854.09s]  of my friends. One of which says you're going to spill the oil on the top all over your new shirt
[854.09s -> 860.65s]  to which I replied no the plastic is still on it. It's okay. Immediately after this the lid slid off
[860.65s -> 867.59s]  and I spilled oil all over my shirt. My next genius plan was to eat an entire spoonful of
[867.59s -> 873.59s]  the hummus which I did. That's not that bad. Only after realizing that the hummus in my mouth was
[873.59s -> 878.63s]  possibly the worst thing I have ever tasted I finally realized that the substance in the jar
[878.63s -> 885.03s]  was in fact raw garb and soybean paste. What? I ran to the sink and attempted to spit out the
[885.03s -> 891.03s]  glob now forming into a paste in my mouth only to realize to my horror that the paste had stuck to
[891.03s -> 896.39s]  every inch of my mouth between my teeth, under my tongue, and on the ridges on the roof of my mouth.
[897.69s -> 903.13s]  In desperation I attempted to turn the sink on to wash my mouth out and pulled up on what I
[903.13s -> 907.85s]  believed to be the sink's handle only for the handle to come off. What? Where are you? Is this
[907.85s -> 916.89s]  a home alone house? It was a soap dispenser. Hold on, I gotta turn these off. Are you sure?
[916.97s -> 921.93s]  Was like Macaulay Calkin fucking walking around? Did you like in your peripheral was like a little
[921.93s -> 929.29s]  kid running up the stairs going like oh and like having paint cans behind him? Okay, hold on,
[929.29s -> 933.21s]  I need to say I need a break from I gotta take a break here because I only did one of these.
[933.21s -> 948.33s]  I can't pay attention. It's been like two minutes. Has it? It has been like 15. It's been 16 minutes.
[949.29s -> 956.44s]  All right, well there's fireman. There's another fireman. Looks good. Very cool. That one's that
[956.44s -> 959.80s]  one's that was not that was less interpretation. That's more of like a true emo right there.
[960.68s -> 981.22s]  Looks good. Oh, I don't want to do that. Spy red. All right, I'm dubbed. Here comes another one.
[981.86s -> 995.50s]  I have to do these like individually guys. This is called Cheerio land. Wait, what happened to my
[995.50s -> 1005.72s]  audio? There is a land called Cheerio land populated entirely by Cheerios. All of the
[1005.72s -> 1010.52s]  different Cheerios live in a caste system with the Honey Nut Cheerios in the leader class,
[1010.52s -> 1015.72s]  the Chocolate Cheerios acting as the Lords and Nobles, the Frosted Cheerios being the somewhat
[1015.72s -> 1022.33s]  well-off peasants and the normal Cheerios as the poor and destitute. One day, a normal Cheerio
[1022.33s -> 1027.21s]  fell in love with a Honey Nut Cheerio, but the only way he could see her was if he eventually
[1027.21s -> 1033.90s]  became a Honey Nut Cheerio himself. Okay. He goes to the Cheerio wizard who is the only person
[1033.90s -> 1040.22s]  capable of upgrading Cheerios to the next level. All right. After working hard for years under the
[1040.22s -> 1046.54s]  supervision of the Cheerio wizard, he is eventually upgraded to a Frosted Cheerio, a Chocolate Cheerio
[1046.54s -> 1052.62s]  and finally becomes a Honey Nut Cheerio. He meets the love of his life at last and together
[1052.62s -> 1059.72s]  they celebrate by going to a nearby fair. After a few hours, they get thirsty and they go to get
[1059.72s -> 1066.74s]  some fruit punch. However, they had to wait in a long line for lemonade because there was no punch
[1066.74s -> 1077.26s]  line. What? I fucked that whole thing up, didn't I? Hold on. There's no punch line. You don't write
[1077.26s -> 1082.76s]  a whole story like that, man. I don't have a punch line. Oh, because I went the other way, right?
[1082.76s -> 1089.53s]  Sorry. I was listening to the Cheerio, like the hierarchy system. I was having trouble paying
[1089.53s -> 1101.56s]  attention. Here we go. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. It's down here. What's going on here?
[1102.44s -> 1111.16s]  So we go 50. Oh, these are the sneakers. I see. Okay. You got me on this one. Hey, you got me.
[1111.16s -> 1129.34s]  Nice work. 59, 7, there it is. Another fireman. He wears sneakers? Oh, well, no, well, these things.
[1129.34s -> 1141.80s]  His legs. Story time. Now. Hold on. We got plenty of time, so don't worry. Story. Now. Story. Now.
[1141.80s -> 1154.86s]  Story. Now. All right. Here, I'll give you two stories in a row. Okay. How's that sound?
[1158.26s -> 1177.37s]  Hopefully these hopefully these were vetted. Okay. Two stories back to back. Next image.
[1178.46s -> 1184.97s]  There used to be a boy who always jumped over the fence. His father told him not to jump over
[1184.97s -> 1189.93s]  the fence because every time he jumped over the fence, he broke a little bit of it. Not to say
[1189.93s -> 1195.91s]  that he was worried about his son, but the boy didn't listen and still jumped over and over.
[1196.71s -> 1201.51s]  Displeased and worried, the father broke the fence down and build a gate on the place where
[1201.51s -> 1207.82s]  once the fence was standing. Yet the boy still jumped over the gate even though he could easily
[1207.82s -> 1214.28s]  open it. So, the father left the gate open all the time and all kind of strangers traveled
[1214.28s -> 1218.68s]  trough the open gate and thanked the father for the easy passage and the father wondered,
[1218.68s -> 1225.21s]  did the boy did that on purpose? In the evening, he asked his son why he jumped over the fence
[1225.21s -> 1230.81s]  and gate and the son replied with a very simple response. I jumped over the fence to prove myself
[1230.81s -> 1238.06s]  that I'm not 5'3 and actually big enough to jump over. Suddenly the father jumped up and started
[1238.06s -> 1243.82s]  to make painful noises and he was not able to control his flatulence anymore while shouting at
[1243.82s -> 1251.77s]  his son, son I pay for your twitch prime so you better support that streamer! Exclamation mark!
[1251.77s -> 1257.88s]  And then something, tell me a sad story. Where is the joy in the life that you have lived?
[1258.44s -> 1266.17s]  And then he began to play a recording. He started with me, then it was Paul, and then it was myself.
[1266.17s -> 1273.91s]  It was great. And then it was all of us. It made me think, why is that so tragic? And I thought,
[1273.91s -> 1281.90s]  well, if they want you to find joy in death, we can do that. But we could not find joy in what we did.
[1281.90s -> 1288.84s]  And we didn't. Why didn't we find happiness in the moment? Then I remember going to the doctor
[1288.84s -> 1295.64s]  and talking to a psychiatrist. This doctor comes in and says, this is the most beautiful thing I've
[1295.64s -> 1304.49s]  ever seen. I said, it's just sad. She said, there is nothing beautiful about what you're saying.
[1304.49s -> 1310.17s]  And then she said, it's just something that must be given. It has to be given willingly.
[1310.17s -> 1317.61s]  What the fuck is this story? It was so difficult to find that. She talked to me for three hours and
[1317.61s -> 1323.48s]  told me that if you don't choose the path of joy, death won't have any meaning for you.
[1323.48s -> 1329.32s]  And then she said, you'll be happy. You have always loved life the way it's meant to be lived
[1329.32s -> 1338.49s]  and to come to terms with death and what it is. That's that one. All right. Nice. All right. It's
[1338.49s -> 1345.59s]  my turn to stream now. Thank you. We go back and forth here. So this is, it looks like German Venus.
[1345.59s -> 1356.25s]  I mean, no, that's too bad. We're sharing time here. This is definitely German Venus. I don't
[1356.25s -> 1359.13s]  know what I did wrong with the eye though. I think I fucked up the eye. The yellow wasn't
[1359.13s -> 1372.86s]  coming out that well. This is the mouth. It was 60. 60's over here. I might have to do smaller,
[1372.86s -> 1384.70s]  a little smaller on the inside here. Use white? How do I use white on a white background?
[1385.66s -> 1393.24s]  That's just what my eye looks like. My eye doesn't look like that. 61. We might have to go,
[1393.24s -> 1397.99s]  I might have to go a tier lower for this. Yeah, we'll go, we'll go on a tier lower.
[1398.31s -> 1418.82s]  A finer line here. 62. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. We're 69 in here. 69, 70. This looks fucked up.
[1419.70s -> 1437.80s]  73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80. It's coming together all the way up.
[1440.38s -> 1444.70s]  77, 88. All right. That actually doesn't look that bad. That looks pretty good.
[1448.33s -> 1453.21s]  89. It was 90. Straight up. And then this is the nose. This is going to be complicated up here.
[1453.21s -> 1459.53s]  100 and plus. 100 plus. Get a story. We'll get two new stories when I do a new, a new game board,
[1459.53s -> 1475.14s]  okay? 90, wait a minute. 90, 91, 92, 93. How's that, that doesn't work, does it? Do I have to
[1475.14s -> 1482.09s]  go like around? Like this, this? Cross the lines. Do I have to cross it? I thought you don't cross
[1482.09s -> 1495.13s]  the streams in a dot to dot. I get, oh wait, it's making the nostril. What does it make,
[1495.13s -> 1517.83s]  what's it making? I don't think that worked. I have to keep, I have to finish it. Hold on.
[1517.83s -> 1535.19s]  One, two, three. All the way around. Down here and then pull it back up here. 18, 19, 120,
[1536.07s -> 1559.67s]  121, 5, 26, 27. That's 20. All the way around. It's another circle. 30, 31, 32. All the way around
[1559.67s -> 1578.46s]  here. Where's 35? 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. Hold on. Let's clean it up a little bit. Maybe get the,
[1578.46s -> 1582.22s]  let me get a little bit bigger. Let me see if I can get in here and just like clean it up.
[1582.22s -> 1588.66s]  This doesn't look right to me. It's, that's supposed to be the nose and I, did I go backwards?
[1599.62s -> 1631.98s]  There it is. Let me see if I go like this. Yeah, no, no, it works. Very good. Hey, what do you say
[1631.98s -> 1640.86s]  we get a couple more stories? You guys like those? That was German Venus. Don't curve lines. Well,
[1640.86s -> 1649.08s]  I didn't look, see? Like I, I wasn't like curving. I was following it up here. I mean, you have to
[1649.08s -> 1659.82s]  curve. Otherwise, what are you gonna, I wouldn't curve them. All right, let's get another story on
[1659.82s -> 1679.13s]  here. Let's see. I'll do three this time. I just like saw the, you guys, I literally, okay,
[1680.01s -> 1697.69s]  these ones are long. This is a long ass story. The next two are like long ass stories. I don't,
[1697.69s -> 1703.21s]  I don't know. All I saw was the last word here. This might be a spoiler for Infinity War. Okay,
[1703.21s -> 1708.25s]  so just, if you haven't seen Infinity War, you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to leave
[1708.89s -> 1717.43s]  now. This might be an Infinity War Marvel spoiler. I just saw a word. Or just hurry up and go watch
[1717.43s -> 1722.90s]  the movie now. Just go watch one of those YouTube videos where they explain the whole story in like
[1722.90s -> 1730.22s]  four minutes. That's how long it's going to take to get there. All right, we'll do that one too.
[1748.70s -> 1756.52s]  Okay, here we go. Next. Next, please. No, I want to introduce the next one. I'm not just,
[1756.52s -> 1761.00s]  we're not gonna have to get blown out by the other streamer who's like more popular than I am. That's
[1761.00s -> 1766.28s]  the problem. The TTS guy is more popular than me right now and it's, I'm not okay with that.
[1766.28s -> 1785.11s]  I'm having trouble with that. Okay, so this one. All right, yeah, well, I'll put on the popular guy.
[1791.96s -> 1798.36s]  Hey guys, I had the circus come to my town last week and I had a lot of fun. Cool. The main
[1798.36s -> 1805.18s]  attraction was called the Short Streamer and my goodness, I never laughed so hard. The crowd kept
[1805.18s -> 1812.73s]  chanting ClayTF2 at him and he was very angry. I felt so bad for him, I bought him a drive.
[1812.73s -> 1817.85s]  Pepper after the show and he said that it was the nicest thing anyone ever did for him and I felt
[1817.85s -> 1824.36s]  so good about myself. About the month later, the Short Streamer wrote to me saying he got into a
[1824.36s -> 1831.56s]  fight with someone named Grill Mastic's BBQ and needed bits for the hospital bill. I wrote back
[1831.56s -> 1837.77s]  and said I couldn't help him but I wished him luck. The next week, someone who looked like he was
[1837.77s -> 1844.33s]  made of glue and wearing a cape stood outside of my door. I had to flee the state because I
[1844.33s -> 1851.35s]  feared for my life and hitched a balloon ride to Las Vegas. Turns out the Short Streamer was also
[1851.35s -> 1856.47s]  on this balloon with me and we had an epic fight which ended with me throwing him off over the
[1856.47s -> 1862.97s]  desert. I don't know where the Short Streamer or the glue man are but if you see anyone who looks
[1862.97s -> 1870.02s]  like that please report him to the authorities. Closing square bracket. Lights began to shine
[1870.02s -> 1875.98s]  through the vent grate. A faint light that could remind anyone of a comfy Boston basement.
[1877.26s -> 1882.94s]  Tim began to lightly step across the ventilation tunnel. His tired legs skittery on the steel as
[1882.94s -> 1890.38s]  he almost escaped. Freedom at last, Tim thought. Years of living in the vent of Jerma's cave,
[1890.38s -> 1896.22s]  he was finally in the home stretch. As he approached the vent, he could hear the faint
[1896.22s -> 1902.49s]  streamer in the chasms below. He couldn't entirely make him out but he could hear something about
[1902.49s -> 1909.66s]  dieting. It didn't matter to him. All that mattered was freedom from the dwarven dungeon.
[1909.66s -> 1915.24s]  His eyes peered through the vent and across the room he found his destination. The door on the
[1915.24s -> 1921.86s]  other side of the room. That must be it, he thought. Once he would be able to make it across, he would
[1921.86s -> 1928.06s]  most likely find the hallways of the gamer king he was always told about. It would lead him to
[1928.06s -> 1934.98s]  the world of outside. He couldn't dream of success yet. He still needed to fly across the chaotic pit.
[1934.98s -> 1940.97s]  The human dwarf hybrid resided. Tim could even see his followers on one of the monitors,
[1940.97s -> 1948.46s]  spamming a subtraction by two for some reason. Tim wasted no time. He flew through the vent
[1948.46s -> 1954.73s]  and onto the nearest surface he could find. He began to shake as this was the final moment
[1954.73s -> 1960.79s]  where it all mattered. Freedom from years of torment of living in Jerma's gamer cave.
[1961.43s -> 1968.86s]  No more. Snap. Closing square bracket. So, one day a church was looking for a replacement.
[1968.86s -> 1976.74s]  What's everybody mind? What did I do? Oh, the story. It's the story. Okay, I was like,
[1976.74s -> 1989.75s]  what happened? I'm just like drawing. What did I do? Oh, that was the word. I know it was in the
[1989.75s -> 1995.85s]  story. I don't know. I'm just a fucking idiot. Here it goes. Here comes the next story.
[1995.85s -> 2001.45s]  So, one day a church was looking for a replacement for the guy they had to climb the tower every
[2001.45s -> 2008.55s]  hour and ring the huge church bell. None of applicants were strong enough to do it. Well,
[2008.55s -> 2014.66s]  finally one day a man with no arms came up to apply for the job. The priest said,
[2014.66s -> 2020.98s]  but how can you ring it with no arms? And the man took a few steps back and ran head first
[2020.98s -> 2029.14s]  into the bell, getting it to ring. He got the job. He did his job well and was on time every hour.
[2029.14s -> 2034.34s]  Until one day after so many blows to the head, when he reared back and ran, he missed and went
[2034.34s -> 2040.89s]  straight off the tower. As people started to gather around him on the ground, frantic, a woman asked
[2040.89s -> 2048.12s]  the man beside her, does anyone know who this is? The man replied, I don't know, but his face rings
[2048.12s -> 2060.10s]  a bell. What? What did I do? I fucked up something over here. What did I do over here? What happened
[2060.10s -> 2071.26s]  over here? No, I did this right. Oh, oh, oh, I know this is correct. This is actually correct.
[2071.26s -> 2083.11s]  This is, this is an earbud. Wow. That's detailed. All right. Where's 51? 51. I don't see 51.
[2085.62s -> 2096.28s]  50, 51. Where's 51? Did everybody see 51? I see 52, 51. There it is. Well, those are two excellent
[2096.28s -> 2116.31s]  stories. Excellent stories, I guess. 5, 56. Am I wearing a monocle? 58. That was three stories.
[2117.70s -> 2150.90s]  59, 60. Okay. 61, 62, 63, 64, 67, 68, 69, 70. Oh, fuck. I screwed it up. No, I didn't. 71, 72,
[2153.11s -> 2187.56s]  3. Up here, 74, 75, 76, 79. Is this my nose? 80, 81. Oh my god. 82, 83. I know what this is.
[2188.28s -> 2200.23s]  I know what this is. This is the, that thing. I already know it. I was wondering why this looks
[2200.23s -> 2227.58s]  so fucked up. 87, 88, 89, 90, 82. Look at how tight these are. 93. Where's 94? There's 84,
[2228.74s -> 2261.03s]  93. Oh, it's right here. 4, 95, 100, 101, 102, 103. Oh, it's coming together. I can see it.
[2264.76s -> 2295.13s]  104, 107. It's right in the middle here. 8, 10. This is fucking scary. It was 12. Right below.
[2296.86s -> 2330.55s]  12. Back up to 13. Where is the dot in 18? 18. Down. 120, 121. I look a fucking hundred years old.
[2330.63s -> 2372.58s]  125, 126, 127, 128. That's wrong? What do you mean that's wrong? No, it's not. I missed 120. No,
[2372.58s -> 2387.90s]  I didn't, did I? Oh, fuck. I can't do that. Wait, let me just see where they are. Okay. No, I'm using
[2387.90s -> 2394.31s]  epic pen. Okay. That's not, what do you mean cheating? Everyone just told me to zoom in.
[2394.31s -> 2403.11s]  All right. 117, 118, 119, 120. I got 120 last time.
[2403.83s -> 2426.54s]  22, 123, 4. Oh, that's fucking 5. 125. Is that it right there? Is that 125? I think so, right?
[2426.54s -> 2437.88s]  Right, okay. Right there. 126, 127, 128.
[2437.88s -> 2459.02s]  Those of you that are wondering if this just looks fucking horrible,
[2459.82s -> 2471.67s]  you always have to remember, this is, this image looks worse than this. The actual source image
[2471.67s -> 2480.71s]  looks worse than this. So, give me a break here. This is not about bad line work. You want us looking
[2480.71s -> 2488.57s]  at your ear the whole time? Fine, I'll sit back like this. Yeah, that'll be, I complained about
[2488.57s -> 2493.37s]  this already. That's the second image when you type in germa, 985 into Google. Thanks, guys.
[2494.33s -> 2510.20s]  Really looking forward to like getting that fucking TV show. 33, 34. Okay, then this goes
[2510.20s -> 2545.83s]  up and around. Big eyebrow. 40, 41, 42, 43. Is my like skin melting? 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,
[2546.79s -> 2563.54s]  50, 51, 54, 67, 58, 59, 160, 161. It's done. There you are. Oh, also, what I, I forgot to do is,
[2564.10s -> 2572.09s]  I need a, I just need a white screen. Hold on. Because after I'm done, I want to just put them
[2572.09s -> 2591.35s]  on a white screen. I think I should be able to do that with just, I just need a white, hold on.
[2591.35s -> 2596.31s]  Let me turn this off for a second. I need to find it. Where is it? No, not this, this.
[2598.44s -> 2615.37s]  Give me one second. I need to make like a new window. Yeah, that's better. Okay. Here we go.
[2615.37s -> 2622.81s]  Just a pure white screen. No, I don't want a 24-hour video of a white screen. Why the
[2622.81s -> 2630.73s]  fuck does that exist? I just want a white background. 24 hours of white screen. 10 hours
[2630.73s -> 2649.54s]  of incredible white screen. I just want a fucking wallpaper. Okay, that's, that's good. Why? All
[2649.54s -> 2660.26s]  right. So, uh, that's good. I'm just going to go like this and I can hide it. So here we go.
[2660.98s -> 2681.82s]  You ready? Are you ready to see? Here is what we're looking at now. I think it actually looks
[2681.82s -> 2692.49s]  pretty good. Good Lord, the tabs. Welcome to the rest of your life on this string. You look like
[2692.49s -> 2706.86s]  Ron Swanson. No, there we go. I can see that. All right, let's keep going. Let's get a couple
[2706.86s -> 2724.73s]  of stories. Okay. We'll do three stories this time. This is just a warm up guys.
[2724.73s -> 2731.51s]  Just wait till we get to the where's wall though. Using ad block plus instead of uBlock origin.
[2733.85s -> 2750.47s]  I don't fucking know. Guys, I only use ad block for the websites that take over your whole computer.
[2750.47s -> 2758.39s]  You know what I'm saying? I only use ad block for the websites that have a whole like, they go like
[2758.39s -> 2762.07s]  this. You open up the webpage and then you see a banner ad and you're like, okay, whatever. I don't
[2762.07s -> 2767.27s]  care. And then that banner ad scrolls down with you and takes over the whole page. It's another page
[2767.27s -> 2773.24s]  on top of the page. I don't know why people think that's a good idea. It is the fucking dumbest
[2773.24s -> 2778.12s]  thing I've ever seen in my entire life. It's like, it's like, if you went to like CVS, right? You
[2778.12s -> 2783.00s]  were walking into CVS and somebody was just standing in front of you screaming in your face
[2783.96s -> 2786.44s]  and they're going like this and they're getting in your fucking way and blocking you and screaming
[2786.44s -> 2792.47s]  in your face. It's like, look, I just want to go into the CVS. Okay. I don't care. You stand over
[2792.47s -> 2797.51s]  there and you scream. Okay. Stand to the side of the door and fucking yell in my face, like from
[2797.51s -> 2805.05s]  like eight feet away. Hey, hey. All right. That guy's, I gotta get past that guy. Don't put it
[2805.05s -> 2811.02s]  right here. Don't make me move and you're just on my fucking body. Stand like over there and scream
[2811.02s -> 2817.22s]  at me while I'm going into the CVS. If I see a website that does that, it immediately goes on
[2817.22s -> 2829.45s]  my shit list. Why do I use a CVS as a store example every time? Because it's CVS every 15 feet.
[2830.17s -> 2842.49s]  There's a CVS literally every fucking like 10 feet in America. Show us your search history.
[2846.52s -> 2851.46s]  No, I'm not going to show you my fucking search history. Do you know why that is?
[2852.68s -> 2860.52s]  It has nothing to do with- Oh, wait a minute. We might see his pornography. No, like I don't
[2860.52s -> 2866.70s]  want- I got like bank information in here. Oh, let me hit P. No, there's all my- that's all my bank
[2866.70s -> 2883.50s]  accounts. Oh, that's funny. You better got him. He's scared. I don't- I don't want you to know
[2883.50s -> 2890.70s]  what I- like I may have typed in like a restaurant that's down the street. Like, oh, whoops.
[2891.83s -> 2902.15s]  No, you ain't getting shit. Uh-uh. That ain't fucking happening. This is all you get. All you
[2902.15s -> 2907.21s]  get, you can just imagine what all those tabs are. Show us every tab. Yeah, you can just imagine
[2907.21s -> 2913.61s]  what's on there, huh? In fact, I'll show you the next one. All right, let's go. All right,
[2913.61s -> 2945.93s]  I got stories to tell. Bear guards? What the fuck is this one? This is so long. Oh my god. Okay,
[2945.93s -> 2949.53s]  we're just doing two because this one is like three- this one's like three minutes long at least.
[2950.33s -> 2963.32s]  Hey, you guys relaxed yet? Here we go. Don't you wish you could see those fucking tabs? Man,
[2963.32s -> 2972.57s]  I wish we could see those fucking tabs. I'll zoom in for this one because I can- I can- it can fit.
[2973.29s -> 2994.76s]  See? The man stands in a room of glass. In front of him is a table with a bowl. Inside the bowl
[2994.76s -> 3001.96s]  is a berry. Surrounding the room people scream and shout. Some yell, eat the berry. While others
[3001.96s -> 3008.04s]  yell, don't eat the berry. It's poisoned. The man looks around the room and sees the berry.
[3008.60s -> 3014.84s]  He places a fork under the berry and chews on it. The man places another fork under the berry and
[3014.84s -> 3021.27s]  chews again. At this point, the man realizes he has eaten poison, thus giving a death sentence
[3021.27s -> 3026.70s]  to anyone trying to make it through the maze. What? He runs through the maze until he is
[3026.70s -> 3033.58s]  outside the cave surrounded by many poisonous berries. Suddenly, the man collapses on his back,
[3033.58s -> 3040.50s]  screaming. At this point, all eyes are on the man. His eyes are full of poison and he wants to escape.
[3040.50s -> 3047.19s]  However, he is surrounded by hundreds of berry hunters. Some of them fight, some just sit there,
[3047.19s -> 3052.79s]  waiting the turn to fight. I can't do this. Eventually, the man breaks free and takes off.
[3052.79s -> 3057.91s]  The man takes off with all of the other bears and they run after him, as all the berry hunters turn
[3057.91s -> 3064.54s]  towards the man and laugh at how pathetic he is. The man tries to flee, but before he can do so,
[3064.54s -> 3070.60s]  the bear guards arrive and shackle him. They take him back to the room he was in originally and
[3070.60s -> 3077.56s]  place another berry down on the table. They then leave, and the cycle starts again. Written by
[3078.36s -> 3084.90s]  and talked to transformer from yahoo california i had a dream that there was a four person swimming

[3156.47s -> 3162.12s]  beating them unconscious in the pool or knocking them out of the pool after numerous failures
[3162.12s -> 3168.84s]  against children i knew that i needed to step up my game i put on a snorkel and immediately became
[3168.84s -> 3176.68s]  a god at the game soon enough i made it to the big leagues my competition was big geo with

[3192.34s -> 3199.00s]  goggles after the round and i made a full rebound geo and the lime watched in horror from the ceiling
[3199.00s -> 3206.65s]  as i pummeled geocchio i snatched the lime from the ceiling and drowned him eliminating him geo
[3206.65s -> 3213.05s]  was a different story approaching him was too risky to do head-on while i was catching my breath

[3220.66s -> 3227.11s]  body floated near me and as geo delivered another web shot i threw the lime at geo the collision

[3623.53s -> 3632.10s]  kings king kong the world's biggest monkey rides all the giant bats closing square bracket for as
[3632.10s -> 3639.45s]  long as i can remember i've always had a fascination with birds i always like to spot them with big
[3639.45s -> 3646.14s]  binoculars i borrowed from my parents and write them down in my big blue bird book i would write
[3646.14s -> 3652.86s]  things like new blue feathered sparrow making a nest in the big oak tree and such i would even
[3652.86s -> 3658.84s]  put photographs next to it the description sometimes so anyway it's quite natural then
[3658.84s -> 3665.72s]  that when i saw a small redheaded woodpecker on the sidewalk i was curious woodpeckers aren't city
[3665.72s -> 3673.08s]  birds in fact i don't think i've ever seen one outside of the woods what was it doing here
[3673.08s -> 3679.58s]  was it lost maybe it was hurt sir i sneakily walked up to it preparing to pick it up and take
[3679.58s -> 3686.07s]  it home to care for it and release it back into the forest it was just walking across the sidewalk
[3686.07s -> 3693.26s]  for some reason not even flying as i came closer though i could make out its details more and more
[3693.26s -> 3700.18s]  clearly and they just didn't make sense this all culminated when i was standing only one or two
[3700.18s -> 3707.67s]  feet away from the little creature and it turned around and i t spoke who a who a who a ha ha who a
[3707.67s -> 3715.77s]  who a who a ha ha who a who a who a ha ha so naturally i took out my flamethrower and torched
[3715.77s -> 3722.36s]  that down to the ground i already warned that psychotic little ship never to come within 10
[3722.36s -> 3735.53s]  feet of me again after he drilled my previous house to the ground good riddance what did that
[3735.53s -> 3740.28s]  i know what it feels like now to have tts on stream you wonder why i don't ever have it on
[3740.28s -> 3746.17s]  i could not scream i would not be able to i would just sit there and be like when is it when do i
[3746.17s -> 3752.78s]  go in now do i go in now do i say anything now i wouldn't be able to pay attention to anything
[3752.78s -> 3756.06s]  there would be something on the screen that i'd need to be reading and i would hear like
[3756.06s -> 3761.82s]  who a who a who a who a and then i went to the bird torch to my face and i'd be like what the
[3761.82s -> 3769.32s]  fuck is it i can't pay attention i don't know how some people can do that you have to have
[3769.32s -> 3774.70s]  lightning focus to have something in the in one of your ears be going like

[3816.50s -> 3820.02s]  gonna do something right now because i need to i need to prove this i have to prove something

[3872.76s -> 3877.24s]  to have a conversation now okay you and me this is you and me this other person is it's not part
[3877.24s -> 3894.92s]  of our conversation hey dude uh hey i wanted to go to uh breakfast with you next week you have

[3965.56s -> 3972.28s]  we're gonna move on the idea is if somebody's talking in your ear and trying to interrupt your
[3972.28s -> 3977.08s]  conversation eventually you're gonna be like i can't hear i cannot talk to this person about
[3977.08s -> 3997.02s]  like the mcdonald's breakfast menu who should stream vote now you wait a minute let's call back
[3997.02s -> 4004.38s]  here to about 20 minutes ago you cannot tell me that you do not like advertisements that take
[4004.38s -> 4009.58s]  over your fucking screen that make a bunch of noise and then tell me that i'm incorrect with this
[4014.60s -> 4031.72s]  you cannot say that oh that one's out of the fucking park i knocked that one out

[4101.38s -> 4107.86s]  unnerved i can't help but return to my computer and used my time watching past vod's of this twitch
[4107.86s -> 4114.49s]  streamer i'm very familiar with he's a popular streamer yet unfamiliar to some being he is the
[4114.49s -> 4118.97s]  top 1000 streamer but me and him have a sort of history going between this
[4120.09s -> 4126.62s]  i met this person a long time ago at a twitch party and we were seemingly getting along i thought
[4126.62s -> 4133.32s]  i'm still really upset on what he said to me my name and to my fans that went to his stream
[4133.32s -> 4140.04s]  of course the past is the past but somehow his words still affect me to this day i haven't
[4140.04s -> 4145.96s]  grilled for a long time mainly through physical issues on my back and hopefully one day i can
[4145.96s -> 4151.88s]  return to what i enjoy a lot my therapist is currently helping me through all this and
[4151.88s -> 4158.82s]  hopefully with enough exercise and healthy foods i will return streaming again never really hated

[4165.50s -> 4171.34s]  chat repeating the words peepee poo poo but really i hope our conflict in the past won't affect our
[4171.34s -> 4177.88s]  relationship now for all you remaining griller fans keep up with my twitter for more steamy

[4473.93s -> 4480.10s]  its inhabitant the little door slowly creaked open and out popped the head of a curious little

[5112.66s -> 5120.34s]  when i felt something brush against my leg glancing down i chuckled as i saw a small child who only
[5120.34s -> 5127.38s]  came up to around my knees walking past with an armful of cheesy watch where you're going kid i
[5127.38s -> 5133.86s]  said smiling at him before turning away suddenly i felt a sharp pain in my foot and looked down
[5133.86s -> 5140.28s]  to see the small child underneath me glaring up angrily at the comparative giant above him
[5140.28s -> 5146.68s]  what the heck did you just call me he demanded in a surprisingly deep bostonian accent that
[5146.84s -> 5153.77s]  sounded familiar i leant down to examine the child more closely before recoiling in shock
[5153.77s -> 5161.46s]  this was no child it was germa i'll have you know i'm a top 1000 streamer who beat dark souls 3
[5161.46s -> 5169.18s]  on stream germa continued his comically small face contorted with rage naturally i quickly
[5169.18s -> 5176.30s]  apologized and asked for a photo declaring he was my favorite compact streamer eventually after
[5176.30s -> 5182.22s]  promising 10 000 bits as compensation for the cheesy i had squashed germa let me take a photo
[5182.22s -> 5190.54s]  with him it was kim who was about my height she hurried over and scooped up the reluctant germa
[5190.54s -> 5197.16s]  in her arms before depositing him in her shopping trolley where he saturday with his arms crossed
[5197.16s -> 5203.00s]  she thanked me for taking care of him and talked him into accepting 1000 bits from me instead
[5203.00s -> 5216.62s]  before bidding her farewells and walking away just once and will there ever be a story where
[5216.62s -> 5223.72s]  i'm not like the little mutant that like bites people why would why can't somebody tell a story
[5223.72s -> 5233.06s]  of me as like fucking zoos or something like as a god now that would be that would nobody would see

[5704.23s -> 5710.23s]  psycho i'll be sitting in public i get a especially at a restaurant i if i have a big sneeze and i'm
[5710.23s -> 5716.55s]  in a restaurant i i don't want to do that i don't want to be the person that hold on another one
[5717.43s -> 5724.06s]  i don't want to be the person that everybody looks over to and goes what the fuck because

[5769.66s -> 5773.82s]  in a way where you can sneeze but still not sneeze so right there what happened was just pull the
[5773.82s -> 5780.12s]  clip back i sneezed but it was like i got all of it out that i needed to i didn't hold it in i'm

[6868.04s -> 6875.06s]  more light through than it kept out i glanced at him and quickly turned away his gaze was too stern
[6875.06s -> 6881.86s]  his face too creepy along the path i went not sure where i was going or where i'd been
[6881.86s -> 6888.65s]  i see the scarecrow up ahead as if i'd somehow gone back a mile but i hadn't you couldn't get
[6888.65s -> 6896.20s]  lost on a path straight as this i kept going shying away from his gaze as i kept walking i
[6896.20s -> 6903.72s]  saw him again and again i lost my nerve and ran ran as fast as i could until i didn't see him
[6903.72s -> 6911.56s]  anymore i felt confident and shouted with joy spinning around ecstatic in victory only i was
[6911.56s -> 6918.63s]  cut short because on the path behind me there he was in the middle of the dirt road i stood stock
[6918.63s -> 6926.49s]  still too scared to breath once again i panic and sprint running until i lose my breath i glance
[6926.49s -> 6933.34s]  behind me and he's only closer i turn to keep running but there he is again closer still i
[6933.34s -> 6940.38s]  keep turning and turning too scared and confused to know what's happening until there he is in

[7891.45s -> 7896.97s]  i was leaning forward from the top step and holding the railing about halfway down the stairs
[7896.97s -> 7903.77s]  planning on swinging from the top to the bottom well my hand slipped and i ended up tumbling head
[7903.77s -> 7911.08s]  over heels down the stairs and i landed flat on my back i tried to recover all cool by sitting up
[7911.08s -> 7917.64s]  and saying well that just happened and went to my next class which was gym i think we played dodge
[7917.64s -> 7924.74s]  ball or something whatever it was it was pretty boring then after class my teacher came up to me
[7924.74s -> 7932.36s]  and said did you fall down the stairs earlier today i said yeah but it's not big deal she told
[7932.52s -> 7937.72s]  me to go to the nurse's office which i did and when i told them what happened they called my
[7937.72s -> 7944.98s]  mom and sent me home so i got to go home early and watch tv because i tried and failed to impress
[7944.98s -> 7952.55s]  some girls in seventh grade pretty good deal if i'm honest closing square bracket that's a cool
[7952.55s -> 7958.31s]  story parts of this story in an online chat room i mean but i thought it's worth sharing it in their
[7958.31s -> 7965.10s]  entirety i had two dreams recently that had an individual that must have made some impact with
[7965.10s -> 7971.69s]  how dreams work and remembering them is uncommon the recent dream had him crashing at my place to
[7971.69s -> 7978.78s]  avoid paying for a hotel originally thinking it was gonna be an awkward experience we ended up just
[7978.78s -> 7986.07s]  talking story on the couch and at the beach the first dream though we driving around north shore
[7986.15s -> 7991.99s]  sunny day ocean peeking over the hill in front empty fields on either side with an occasional
[7991.99s -> 7998.87s]  tree grove to break up the monogamy it was just us and the road eventually they pulled off the
[7998.87s -> 8005.34s]  road to park i watched them step out and round the front and with no rhyme or reason they started to
[8005.34s -> 8013.30s]  take the pants off shocked i grabbed for the door handle but i woke up before i could heart pounding
[8013.30s -> 8020.65s]  with the dream still fresh i mumbled since when did you drive joma if they ever read this somehow
[8020.65s -> 8027.29s]  thank you so much for the talk it was fun and we had a lot of laughs i'm also said some things
[8027.29s -> 8033.53s]  that were uplifting and made me reflect on some things gosh i really wish i could remember what
[8033.53s -> 8039.86s]  was said thank you again but what are you talking about i think i should be flattered but you know
[8039.86s -> 8047.30s]  first impressions are important right closing square bracket one two oatmeal kirby is wanted
[8047.30s -> 8054.23s]  on four counts of homicide and seven counts of grand theft larceny kirby was last seen in dream
[8054.23s -> 8061.34s]  land sucking off bark from these weird face trees officers tried to detain kirby but he managed to
[8061.34s -> 8068.17s]  escape by eating them whole there were absolutely no survivors but we managed to recover this
[8068.17s -> 8074.97s]  information off of the live feed of one of our officers we believe that kirby's current motives
[8074.97s -> 8082.15s]  are to overtake king ddd and quote wear his ass like a helmet we can only speculate the motives
[8082.15s -> 8088.95s]  his partner meta knight was also seen blowing a guy in the alley if you see kirby do not approach
[8088.95s -> 8096.09s]  him if he offers you oatmeal he's trying to fuck you do not approach him he will get inside of you
[8096.09s -> 8103.43s]  any way he can he is a dangerous and lethal character do not go near him i know this first
[8103.43s -> 8109.03s]  hand because when i was in the field and he was just a new suspect i thought oh that's just a

[9023.50s -> 9040.66s]  music on let's go when i was younger my father would take me to my bedroom door frame and measure
[9040.66s -> 9047.22s]  my height with a marker once a month that evening i remember waking up on the first of every month
[9047.22s -> 9053.94s]  excited that i would be able to see how far i have grown since the previous month now as a child i
[9053.94s -> 9060.52s]  always had a head larger than my body the doctor said that this is normal for a child of my age
[9060.52s -> 9067.08s]  and that my body will eventually catch up to the size of my head after a few years i had finally
[9067.08s -> 9072.92s]  reached an impasse my head was somewhat normal sized and my full height on the door frame was
[9072.92s -> 9079.56s]  a humbling five feet six inches my father told me that since i was at my later teenage years that
[9079.56s -> 9086.30s]  my body would stop growing as fast this disappointed me perhaps i would grow more in a few years
[9087.10s -> 9092.54s]  13 years later i was sick and tired of it all i tried getting into really good shape ate super
[9092.54s -> 9098.71s]  healthy and even went to a chiropractor to make my back the straightest there is i didn't even

[9106.31s -> 9111.51s]  it stretches all day listens when yeah and went to bed super early without measuring my height
[9112.31s -> 9118.47s]  the next morning i woke up and immediately measured myself i grew two centimeters guys

[9125.43s -> 9129.99s]  germa's stream the other day and he was just doing this impression of two viewers talking
[9130.95s -> 9135.75s]  it was really weird he would act like one of the viewers had recommended the stream to the other
[9135.75s -> 9141.13s]  but that that viewer had become disillusioned with the stream after seeing something weird
[9141.13s -> 9147.19s]  yeah it was just strange man not sure what i expected but please don't link me to that streamer
[9147.19s -> 9156.23s]  ever again thank you closing square bracket germa 985 wanted to go to the potluck as a member of the
[9156.23s -> 9161.67s]  community after a lot of back and forth he got his own pass with a note to the people that were
[9161.67s -> 9167.67s]  coming for the event i would really appreciate your attendance what that was how most of my friends
[9167.67s -> 9171.99s]  made their way here they came by their friends and told them where to start going
[9172.97s -> 9177.45s]  it's kind of a shame that the people in charge of keeping the community running don't share that
[9177.45s -> 9185.67s]  same mindset when asked if he was expecting a big response from his own friends no i mean it's not
[9185.67s -> 9190.97s]  even close we have probably only a couple of hundred people that are showing up to see the
[9190.97s -> 9197.19s]  first time we put on the event that may have been the result of just a few hundred people showing up
[9197.19s -> 9202.62s]  and a lot of that might not have been the result of that there wasn't really any indication that
[9202.62s -> 9208.31s]  something was going to take off like this for us just who this is who were coming would appreciate
[9208.31s -> 9219.27s]  us that was it that was i don't know what that story was we're gonna go smaller uh let's do the

[20459.19s -> 20465.91s]  think in a million years that when i rest my arms on my sides my hands are like a foot and a half
[20465.91s -> 20482.62s]  from the ground that would mean i would have to have like four and a half foot long arms and that's
[20482.62s -> 20486.70s]  just evidence here that's i'll draw a little thing for you just to get this out of the way

[21295.43s -> 21300.50s]  do that i thought it was going to be shorter i thought this was only going to be like a couple
[21300.50s -> 21308.47s]  hours but there was a lot there was a ton of uh contributions so there still is a bunch of jokes
[21309.40s -> 21317.96s]  and a bunch of brain teasers so what i'm going to do is i'm going to compile these jokes and brain
[21317.96s -> 21332.15s]  teasers i'm going to pull out some of my favorites we're going to go over them not today because i
[21332.15s -> 21338.26s]  did not realize that i'd been streaming for six hours i was kind of having too much fun
[21342.73s -> 21354.28s]  i was really only supposed to stream for three or four but i was having too much fun with all
[21354.28s -> 21363.50s]  this stuff i did most of the stories the stories were ridiculous too jokes and brain teasers i can
[21363.50s -> 21371.02s]  compile and do them and i might just do that i might just pull them out randomly like whenever
[21371.02s -> 21380.81s]  i feel like just doing something just hanging out there's a shitload of them yeah i am going to bid
[21380.81s -> 21387.21s]  you all farewell this is the last time you are all going to see or hear my voice and face
[21388.65s -> 21404.60s]  until the 21st got a lot to do the next time this stream is live you will be at the carnival
[21404.60s -> 21411.22s]  he tricked us into giving him free jokes for the rest of the year and that's the play you figured
[21411.22s -> 21423.50s]  it out the carnival i i have a i pinned a tweet and i have a thing you can do have not hashtag
[21423.74s -> 21430.31s]  exclamation point carnival i'll tell you the date it's 10 21st starting at around 12 p.m eastern
[21430.31s -> 21447.10s]  that's right i'm going back to eastern time for this but there's a lot to do in the meantime the
[21447.74s -> 21454.57s]  few companies that are involved i we have to pin down a lot of things when are we going to get
[21454.57s -> 21463.43s]  access to the robots where would it end when and where we will be streaming this from there's an
[21463.43s -> 21479.08s]  event coordinator and there is the robot company so there is a lot to do i will see you guys
[21480.38s -> 21486.47s]  saturday those of you still sticking around we will be doing the end of the
[21487.19s -> 21496.23s]  stream stuff i'm gonna go like this and i'm gonna go like this thank you for that tonight i knew i
[21496.23s -> 21503.32s]  was trying the reason why i wanted to really do this this is gonna sound it's not gonna sound bad
[21503.32s -> 21513.13s]  or anything but it's gonna sound uh maybe weird to some of you this was a test of community night
[21513.13s -> 21526.82s]  stuff this is a test i tested you i think you you i think it was great i wanted to do something
[21526.82s -> 21534.34s]  chill and i wanted to have a bunch of community contributed stuff artwork i wanted to see how
[21534.34s -> 21543.93s]  long it would take to do this kind of stuff i have a pretty good idea of submissions and
[21544.89s -> 21553.14s]  all the mods that were involved in it too thank you everybody for making the stream like this
[21553.14s -> 21560.97s]  happened i knew i wanted something the day before i was pretty much going to leave to just be
[21560.97s -> 21564.97s]  relaxing and hang out and just see how a community night went this is a community night this is the
[21564.97s -> 21581.08s]  first one essentially is the one what you just watched thank you for being a part of it let's
[21581.16s -> 21591.40s]  continue on to the bits earlier today we had five dollars from bake me home you should have a
[21591.40s -> 21599.06s]  contest to design a germa odin emote don't give us any prompts just let us come up with what we
[21599.06s -> 21612.44s]  think germa odin should be i probably will do another emote contest eventually i have i have
[21612.44s -> 21624.30s]  like a lot of slots now they need to be filled i just need to get on it but that's not a bad idea
[21629.22s -> 21639.05s]  thank you slalom for the five dollars my colonoscopy went well thanks germ and then
[21639.05s -> 21650.18s]  they say come to brazil uh that's i'm really happy to hear that it went well i told you it's easy it's
[21650.18s -> 21659.26s]  a lot more strange and nerve-wracking than the procedure actually is so i'm glad to hear it went
[21659.26s -> 21676.20s]  well thank you so much for the five dollars germa wild one wild two wild three uh yeah the prep is
[21676.20s -> 21682.02s]  the worst part of this the the thing about a colonoscopy is just not being able to eat
[21682.82s -> 21687.74s]  once you cross that threshold of not being able to eat solid food for two or three straight days
[21688.62s -> 21701.50s]  is when you start to succumb to madness just drinking clear chicken broth and eating jello
[21703.50s -> 21715.40s]  is gah it's horrible and the worst part is even when after you're done you still you're all kind
[21715.40s -> 21719.24s]  of fucked up so you you're not the second you get out of a colonoscopy you're not sitting there
[21719.24s -> 21725.24s]  going oh where can't wait to go to burger king no you're like on like drugs and shit you just
[21725.24s -> 21735.37s]  want to go home and go to bed and just relax and maybe eat something small but i'm glad to
[21735.37s -> 21741.03s]  hear it went well thank you for the five dollars thank you to sam freelance police for the five
[21741.03s -> 21747.43s]  dollars germa i gave you five dollars on the dragon's lair stream but you got coxed so you
[21747.43s -> 21754.15s]  never saw it i'm sorry about that i hate when that happens because it just deletes every sub
[21754.15s -> 21760.95s]  and every bit that was there and then having to go back and sort of reread everything is almost
[21760.95s -> 21765.67s]  like that a day or two has gone by and it's none of it it's relevant none of it's relevant anymore
[21765.67s -> 21769.83s]  for the day in that few hours i just always feel fucking terrible when it happens so
[21771.32s -> 21774.52s]  we sometimes try to go back and i've done it a few times going back and reading them
[21776.22s -> 21780.86s]  but i'm sorry that it happened i wish i could correct it i wish that stuff didn't happen but
[21781.26s -> 21792.79s]  does but they say uh i've been watching your stuff since i was like 13 i'm 19 now
[21793.94s -> 21798.82s]  i just left my home country of portugal to move to germany for game design university
[21799.38s -> 21805.06s]  this is my first night all alone you have any tips on living alone far away from your parents
[21805.06s -> 21810.82s]  thanks for all the laughs and for being with me on the journey uh that sounds like quite a journey
[21812.15s -> 21821.58s]  yeah congratulations going to a game design university it's awesome the i don't know how
[21823.18s -> 21827.50s]  relevant this is to you but it was very relevant for me and i don't know what the
[21828.22s -> 21833.50s]  obviously it might not be possible with you know being at a university or wherever you're living
[21833.50s -> 21840.81s]  at the university or something but i lived alone for a very long time and the number one thing
[21840.89s -> 21848.01s]  that i would say to anybody that lives alone is get a dog get a dog get a cat get an animal get
[21848.01s -> 21860.78s]  some kind of companion because then you're not and if that's not possible you know obviously if
[21860.78s -> 21869.69s]  you can't bring into a living situation a a friend like a pet a companion right then the best thing
[21869.69s -> 21879.85s]  you can do is to try to find stuff to do that you're interested in that you can find other
[21879.85s -> 21886.01s]  people that like the same shit that you do i've said this advice before but everybody's on the
[21886.01s -> 21893.59s]  same fucking page nobody knows anybody and all you have are your interests everything else is
[21893.59s -> 21902.78s]  left completely at the door nobody knows anybody nobody knows how you were in high school nobody
[21902.78s -> 21907.58s]  knows who your friends are nobody knows what your life is like or who you kind of are as a person
[21908.70s -> 21920.71s]  so you're only basing stuff on interests and if you can find a group of people that are interested
[21920.71s -> 21927.26s]  in the same thing you kind of just start at that i like this you like this too i don't know who you
[21927.26s -> 21931.82s]  are and you don't know me either but we're literally sitting next to each other in this fucking class
[21932.90s -> 21939.00s]  and i like that shit too and then you just start talking you just start hanging out you start doing
[21939.00s -> 21942.76s]  group projects a lot of colleges do that they do group projects and they put you together and
[21943.48s -> 21958.12s]  that's really the the way to do it or have like i said get an animal because if you have an animal
[21958.12s -> 21964.63s]  you are you're never alone because that whatever like for instance auto right i was always alone
[21965.43s -> 21972.25s]  in that place that i was living in it's just me and auto and that was it and you know sometimes
[21972.25s -> 21975.61s]  it was a little weird you know i'd get up and i'd make food and it's just like okay like
[21975.93s -> 21984.17s]  i'm like creeping up the stairs and there's no humans but no i but it didn't matter because
[21984.17s -> 21988.57s]  within five seconds of me thinking about that oh there's auto lying on the pillow hey auto and
[21988.57s -> 21996.62s]  he's like hi i'm here i'm happy to see you so you get to essentially have that kind of interaction
[21996.62s -> 22005.14s]  with something take it for a walk play around lie down on the couch with them and stuff like that
[22005.14s -> 22014.71s]  it was it was always very easy to just chill with your little furry friend but hopefully
[22014.71s -> 22022.28s]  that helps good luck take care thank you for the five dollars sam freelance police appreciate it
[22024.46s -> 22028.06s]  50 thanks for the four dollars and eight cents i bet you there is at least one triangle picture
[22028.06s -> 22034.30s]  there was i did not use it uh the other one that i was considered there was a there's one or two
[22034.30s -> 22042.12s]  others that i didn't like maybe three maybe four total well i i've you know 2020 hindsight
[22043.24s -> 22048.12s]  there was like three or four of the of the vine meats and i was gonna use one and then i was like
[22048.12s -> 22057.67s]  oh wow i just glossed over them and instead i put in the just circle of the germa sun it was just
[22057.67s -> 22061.99s]  the one that was a circle i don't know why i was like yeah i guess i'll just not put that i don't
[22061.99s -> 22067.18s]  know why i didn't put that in i think it's because i saw two or three of them in a row and there was
[22067.18s -> 22071.98s]  like three or four fireman's in a row right there too so i was like oh shit i don't want to have
[22071.98s -> 22080.97s]  maybe i should do like maybe just change it up yes there was a triangle it's if you want to do it
[22080.97s -> 22083.53s]  it's pretty hard it's in that discord right now you can go look at it right now
[22091.16s -> 22098.20s]  nova ostra thanks for the three dollars hey germo you're the best streamer on twitch thank you you
[22098.20s -> 22105.48s]  always make me laugh no matter what you do love you that's just an insanely nice thing to have
[22105.48s -> 22112.49s]  anybody ever say thank you i just i'm just doing my thing here that's that's what that's all i'm
[22112.49s -> 22120.90s]  gonna do and that's all i ever will do i'm glad you enjoy the streams thank you hey plank thank
[22120.90s -> 22127.13s]  you plank v2 for the 20 bucks 20 dollars from plank if you went back 10 years and asked yourself
[22127.13s -> 22139.72s]  where you would be would you have pictured this thanks for making my days uh no there was no way
[22139.72s -> 22147.42s]  to predict that this is gonna happen because it didn't exist something like live streaming
[22148.30s -> 22157.88s]  whether it's video games or edited video type content or irl content or this stuff didn't exist
[22159.42s -> 22162.54s]  so there was no way to ever know this would ever be a thing that anybody did
[22166.01s -> 22174.02s]  even back with youtube youtube yeah i mean youtube was a thing but i never knew that i never thought
[22174.02s -> 22178.90s]  at all that youtube was going to turn into a way for me to make like money and be like a job
[22178.90s -> 22185.35s]  essentially in no way yeah there was you couldn't there was no monetization on videos
[22186.15s -> 22193.46s]  when i was making videos that happened a couple years really after i started at least a year or
[22193.46s -> 22199.46s]  two and then once it became knowledgeable that you could get ad revenue from your videos
[22200.42s -> 22209.42s]  the whole thing erupted erupted people started coming in and holy shit we can make money from
[22209.42s -> 22224.87s]  our youtube videos now and the whole space just went crazy i just kind of kept doing what i was
[22224.87s -> 22234.28s]  doing and i'll be honest not very much has changed in regards to how i approach what i do here
[22239.05s -> 22246.86s]  but no i there's no way i would have known what would i but what would i've done if i didn't do
[22246.86s -> 22255.59s]  it i would work with animals or something i've done volunteer work before with animal um
[22258.01s -> 22261.21s]  oh i can't think of the word animal shelters i've done
[22262.49s -> 22267.29s]  volunteer work with animal shelters i really maybe would have tried to been like a vet tech
[22267.29s -> 22275.26s]  or something i liked computers maybe i would have done some computer stuff it stuff i don't know i've
[22275.26s -> 22281.10s]  talked about a few times but i don't know i can't tell you who knows in 10 years i might be doing
[22281.10s -> 22287.05s]  that i can't predict you what's going to happen in five years 10 years no idea you could be a
[22287.05s -> 22298.57s]  mosquito doctor uh we had big bits just coming right now from the man himself phylactery lich
[22300.42s -> 22317.11s]  50 dollars from phylactery 5000 bits thank you again for the ultra money they say hey germa i'm
[22317.11s -> 22322.87s]  not going to be able to watch the carnival live i have to work so i can afford to give you more
[22322.95s -> 22334.39s]  subs can you go ahead and move it to sunday that would be great i tell you i i better be like
[22334.39s -> 22350.54s]  one percent of your income i better be like point two percent of your income he's he's getting
[22350.54s -> 22358.65s]  closer to owning 20 he's got 20 30 percent of the stream he doesn't own 50 of the company yet don't
[22358.65s -> 22368.65s]  do it no i can't change that that date is not something i am able to change remember it's not
[22368.65s -> 22380.62s]  just me i have hired two separate companies to make the stream possible all the robot contracting
[22380.62s -> 22387.66s]  out with andy mark to make the robots and then the company that is producing the actual stream
[22387.66s -> 22396.97s]  portion event location and crew they're hey can i do it on sunday instead it's like what the
[22397.05s -> 22401.64s]  fuck are you talking about no it's set in stone with these two different companies
[22412.97s -> 22418.10s]  and as much as it would you know every you always want more time but i don't think we don't need it
[22421.06s -> 22425.22s]  i mean you guys gotta remember i this has been something that's been being worked on for a few
[22425.22s -> 22440.63s]  months more than that so it's not a thing where it's like oh we can move it i guess i had to
[22440.63s -> 22451.90s]  liquidate bald coin for this one but there are multiple companies involved i mean i'm not
[22451.90s -> 22456.70s]  changing the date but if that if it ever came down to it if it was kind of just me and another
[22456.70s -> 22463.02s]  person and maybe one other thing and we contracted out robots and now there's like 20 people that are
[22463.02s -> 22478.23s]  involved in this split between two potentially even three different companies so no that's that
[22478.23s -> 22485.91s]  is that's completely out of my hands at this point we all agreed on a date that things could happen
[22486.63s -> 22491.11s]  when people were available for things when this company was going to be available
[22492.95s -> 22497.51s]  to produce it and where they were going to produce it those are all things that i cannot change
[22498.23s -> 22509.72s]  do we have to fight over the robots in a way in a matter of speaking yes in a matter of speaking
[22509.72s -> 22529.14s]  yes for control you know what i'm saying i'm prepared i'm prepared but let's go back what
[22529.14s -> 22533.94s]  we were doing before phylactery again you've given fucking hundreds and hundreds of dollars today
[22535.96s -> 22540.36s]  and yesterday and day before and a day before and like a week before that and two weeks before that
[22540.36s -> 22555.64s]  it's a ton of money dude but thanks thank you also to uh grack store for the 10 bucks

[23407.50s -> 23414.14s]  walgreens photo counter would say if you asked to have a board of 985 pictures of yourself blown up
[23414.14s -> 23421.14s]  so you could hang it on your wall well i don't think that's uh necessarily strange what would
[23421.14s -> 23429.30s]  be strange is the subject matter of all of those photos because let's say i was doing a thing
[23429.86s -> 23436.10s]  where hey this is me this is all my baby pictures all the way through when i was two into when i
[23436.10s -> 23440.50s]  was five here's my first day of school here's to me and my friends and you have hundreds of
[23440.50s -> 23447.13s]  pictures like a collage of your whole life people do that the only difference is this is scary
[23447.13s -> 23454.97s]  pictures of me manipulated to make me look as scary as possible all over the last same time
[23454.97s -> 23463.93s]  period i think that they would be more curious and concerned about that than the amount of pictures
[23468.94s -> 23477.40s]  but no probably i don't know maybe they wouldn't say anything but thanks to the 250 dork cube thank
[23477.40s -> 23482.76s]  you gnarly for the 250 fun stream tonight if that blueberry germa face doesn't become an emote i'll
