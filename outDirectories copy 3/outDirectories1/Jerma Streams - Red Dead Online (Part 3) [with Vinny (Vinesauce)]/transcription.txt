[1.66s -> 3.66s]  Just because.
[3.66s -> 9.16s]  Alright, so now you're in the party? Okay.
[9.16s -> 15.11s]  We're getting playstationed. Yeah, that doesn't matter.
[15.11s -> 17.99s]  Alright, so, join the party.
[17.99s -> 20.30s]  Here we are. Okay.
[20.30s -> 23.86s]  Now play together.
[23.86s -> 25.86s]  Play together is a feature that makes it easy to play multiple games
[25.86s -> 29.90s]  with a place to play to power up the AI. Okay.
[29.90s -> 32.46s]  How do you want to play together? Join game session.
[32.46s -> 40.70s]  What's the method?
[40.70s -> 43.64s]  And then join friends game.
[43.64s -> 47.54s]  Oh, okay, okay. That would make sense.
[47.54s -> 50.30s]  Alright, so I'm just going to look into
[50.30s -> 52.30s]  free roam and just try to jump into your game.
[52.30s -> 56.52s]  That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[56.52s -> 60.36s]  Oh, okay.
[60.36s -> 62.36s]  So while we're doing this, have you played through all the single player yet in this?
[62.36s -> 64.36s]  Uh, I have not.
[64.36s -> 66.36s]  I'm like 40% of the way through.
[66.36s -> 69.24s]  Okay, so you're on like chapter 3 then?
[69.24s -> 71.24s]  Yeah.
[71.24s -> 73.24s]  I just barely am like into chapter 3, I think.
[73.24s -> 77.34s]  Yeah, there's a lot left.
[77.34s -> 79.34s]  I mean, there's a hot air balloon.
[79.34s -> 81.77s]  Really? There's a hot air balloon?
[81.77s -> 83.77s]  No, that was you.
[83.77s -> 86.14s]  Ooh.
[86.14s -> 88.14s]  There's an Elvis impersonator. I love those things.
[88.14s -> 90.14s]  That's some of my favorite means of travel.
[90.14s -> 92.50s]  I'm glad you're bringing it up.
[92.50s -> 94.87s]  Yeah, I want to know all about that in a couple minutes.
[94.87s -> 96.87s]  But before we, um,
[96.87s -> 98.87s]  before we do that, I want to also say there's a game called Rust
[98.87s -> 100.87s]  that just implemented hot air balloons.
[100.87s -> 102.87s]  Oh my god, are you serious?
[102.87s -> 104.87s]  Yeah, swear to god.
[104.87s -> 106.87s]  Alright, let me, uh, give me one second.
[106.87s -> 109.94s]  I have to say hello to somebody.
[109.94s -> 111.94s]  Somebody just knocked on my door.
[111.94s -> 113.94s]  I gotta say hello to them. Hold on.
[113.94s -> 115.94s]  Hey, it's you guys! It's my stream!
[115.94s -> 117.94s]  My stream!
[117.94s -> 119.94s]  I'm half expecting this to be
[119.94s -> 121.94s]  It's not.
[121.94s -> 123.94s]  Uh, oh.
[123.94s -> 126.25s]  I just want to say hello.
[126.25s -> 128.25s]  Playing Red Dead Online with Vinnie.
[128.25s -> 132.02s]  In case you didn't know, just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[132.02s -> 134.02s]  Hey, how you doing?
[134.02s -> 136.71s]  It's me, Elvis.
[136.71s -> 138.71s]  Vinnie Vinesauce.
[138.71s -> 140.71s]  That was fucking really good.
[140.71s -> 142.71s]  That was really,
[142.71s -> 144.71s]  that was really good.
[144.71s -> 146.71s]  I had to come back and say that.
[146.71s -> 148.71s]  I'm half expecting this to be a skit.
[148.71s -> 150.71s]  I had to fucking clown here.
[150.71s -> 152.71s]  I just sent him home.
[152.71s -> 155.08s]  Hey, that's Vinnie!
[155.08s -> 157.90s]  Wait, is that Vinnie?
[157.90s -> 160.52s]  That's Vinnie! Vinnie!
[160.52s -> 162.52s]  Hey, I made it!
[162.52s -> 164.52s]  Let me see your character. What is, what is this character?
[164.52s -> 166.52s]  My character is loathsome looking.
[166.52s -> 169.27s]  Let me see yours.
[169.27s -> 171.27s]  Yeah, I hate my character. At least, at least you're a dude looks like.
[171.27s -> 173.64s]  You're about to say me.
[173.64s -> 176.33s]  You're about to say looks like me.
[176.33s -> 179.59s]  You think that's what I look like?
[179.59s -> 181.59s]  No. Well hey, I mean, if anything, we could be in a band called The Stooges.
[181.59s -> 183.59s]  I look like Iggy Pop. You look like the drummer.
[183.59s -> 185.59s]  So I guess we're good.
[185.59s -> 187.96s]  Let me add you to a posse.
[187.96s -> 190.14s]  I think we can do that now.
[190.14s -> 192.14s]  No, this looks like the taxi driver from The Muppets.
[195.78s -> 198.41s]  Don't make fun of my face ever again!
[198.41s -> 200.41s]  Alright, so now we're friends.
[200.41s -> 202.41s]  That was a friend punch.
[202.41s -> 205.03s]  So, get your hat.
[205.03s -> 207.53s]  You look like Solid Snake from the third one.
[207.53s -> 212.18s]  Squeeze the hop.
[212.18s -> 214.18s]  Oh yeah, I started the cycle.
[214.18s -> 216.68s]  I got a posse.
[216.68s -> 218.68s]  You must be able to pay fee to create a posse.
[218.68s -> 221.30s]  I must be able to pay fee?
[221.30s -> 223.74s]  Fuck you, Rockstar.
[223.74s -> 225.74s]  That's like a funny laugh out loud Rockstar
[225.74s -> 227.74s]  is taking payment joke, right?
[227.74s -> 230.34s]  Uh huh. Oh, it's real though.
[230.34s -> 232.34s]  You're on my all temporary posse.
[232.34s -> 235.78s]  Alright, so invites.
[235.78s -> 238.86s]  Your tent has been moved
[238.86s -> 240.86s]  to Vinesauce's camp.
[240.86s -> 243.35s]  So we share a camp now.
[243.35s -> 246.04s]  Yeah.
[246.04s -> 248.04s]  Let's just do a quick test.
[248.04s -> 250.54s]  Alright, let me use your hat though.
[250.54s -> 253.42s]  I'm ready for my picture.
[253.42s -> 255.42s]  Alright, friendly fire is confirmed off.
[255.42s -> 257.42s]  Which is good because I didn't know if that was going to work.
[257.42s -> 259.42s]  But I have to figure out which one of our hats
[259.42s -> 262.10s]  I like better on my hat.
[262.10s -> 264.73s]  I hate my hat, so.
[264.73s -> 266.90s]  Where did you get this thing?
[266.90s -> 268.90s]  It was a default, like jabroni hat.
[268.90s -> 270.90s]  So is this one.
[270.90s -> 273.85s]  Then why is mine dirtier than yours?
[273.85s -> 275.85s]  I don't know actually. What have you been doing?
[275.85s -> 277.85s]  What have you been rolling around in the mud?
[277.85s -> 279.85s]  I think so. Last time I played this, I think that's what I did.
[279.85s -> 282.73s]  Alright, let's go have fun.
[282.73s -> 284.73s]  Yeah, I don't know where that is.
[284.73s -> 286.73s]  So this is a bunch of random missions.
[286.73s -> 288.73s]  Have you done any online at all?
[288.73s -> 291.22s]  I've done some of the missions online, yeah.
[291.22s -> 293.22s]  I've done like a death match.
[293.22s -> 295.72s]  I've done some of the team based stuff.
[295.72s -> 298.09s]  It was fun, I enjoyed it. Cool, cool.
[298.09s -> 300.09s]  Whoa, what was that? Lightning?
[300.09s -> 302.90s]  There's a lightning mission starting.
[302.90s -> 305.46s]  We have horses, don't we?
[305.46s -> 307.77s]  Somewhere we have horses.
[307.77s -> 310.20s]  My horse is coming from behind here.
[310.20s -> 312.89s]  This is interesting. Showdown series.
[312.89s -> 314.89s]  Large match. Oh, this is the stuff I did.
[314.89s -> 319.30s]  This stuff is pretty fun.
[319.30s -> 321.30s]  You want to just ride off and like...
[321.30s -> 323.30s]  You want to just lasso people and torture them?
[325.30s -> 327.54s]  Oh yeah, that's the first thing you want to do when you get online.
[327.54s -> 329.54s]  Why don't we torture people?
[329.54s -> 333.00s]  That sounds like fun.
[333.00s -> 338.94s]  Like this guy.
[338.94s -> 342.01s]  He's pulling out his gun. Well, we killed him.
[342.01s -> 344.01s]  He's dead.
[344.01s -> 346.01s]  I guess we did torture him.
[346.01s -> 348.01s]  He was tortured in life.
[348.01s -> 350.01s]  We got a murder trophy?
[350.01s -> 352.01s]  I guess that means we're bad.
[352.01s -> 354.01s]  I was wondering why...
[354.01s -> 356.01s]  Are you a good guy or are you a bad guy in these games?
[358.01s -> 360.01s]  I'm more or less a good guy online.
[360.01s -> 362.01s]  Though I've done some horrendously questionable things.
[362.01s -> 364.01s]  How about you?
[364.01s -> 366.01s]  I'm always a good guy.
[366.01s -> 368.01s]  No matter what.
[368.01s -> 370.01s]  Any opportunity that presents itself, I always do the right thing.
[372.38s -> 374.38s]  Is that going to be a problem for this stream?
[374.38s -> 376.68s]  I'm not sure.
[376.68s -> 378.68s]  We may have some disagreements.
[378.68s -> 381.18s]  I fed someone to an alligator.
[381.18s -> 385.46s]  I hear gunshots.
[385.46s -> 387.46s]  Okay, that's a good deed.
[387.46s -> 389.46s]  Just trying to do good deeds over here.
[389.46s -> 392.54s]  Yeah, that seems like it was a good deed.
[392.54s -> 394.54s]  For sure.
[394.54s -> 396.54s]  I just ran past that guy's horse.
[396.54s -> 398.54s]  That poor, frightened, scared horse.
[398.54s -> 400.54s]  He just killed its owner.
[400.54s -> 402.54s]  I was trying to help that guy.
[402.54s -> 404.54s]  There was flies around his head.
[404.54s -> 407.10s]  I was trying to get rid of them.
[407.10s -> 409.34s]  This is like his camp.
[409.34s -> 412.09s]  Oh man, that guy just good-guided me.
[412.09s -> 414.09s]  Get that good guy down there.
[414.09s -> 416.26s]  I got him.
[416.26s -> 419.59s]  Can you help me?
[419.59s -> 421.77s]  Yeah, let me find you.
[421.77s -> 423.77s]  Is this left or dead?
[423.77s -> 426.71s]  I think so.
[426.71s -> 428.71s]  You're bleeding out and you're dead.
[430.71s -> 436.34s]  That guy's whole camp just disappeared.
[436.34s -> 439.80s]  I'm going to do an emote.
[439.80s -> 441.80s]  I'm going to wave. I want to be friends.
[441.80s -> 443.80s]  Are you going to be friends with this guy?
[443.80s -> 445.98s]  I'm going to try to be friends with him.
[445.98s -> 448.86s]  I'm going to offer the twig of peace.
[448.86s -> 450.86s]  What's the emote wheel?
[450.86s -> 452.86s]  You hold L2, you press R1,
[452.86s -> 454.86s]  and then you get an emote.
[454.86s -> 456.86s]  You can do an emote wheel.
[458.86s -> 462.57s]  Please tell this guy
[462.57s -> 464.57s]  over the fake voice chat.
[464.57s -> 466.57s]  Oh, never mind.
[466.57s -> 469.13s]  What?
[469.13s -> 471.13s]  I didn't try to do anything.
[471.13s -> 473.13s]  I think he has his flag up.
[473.13s -> 476.78s]  I don't think we can do anything to him.
[476.78s -> 478.78s]  I didn't know that was a thing, but I'm glad it is.
[478.78s -> 481.08s]  I'm going to farewell handshake this guy.
[481.08s -> 483.08s]  Never mind.
[483.08s -> 485.08s]  I tried.
[489.69s -> 491.69s]  It's just like GTA Online.
[491.69s -> 493.69s]  Excuse me, partner.
[493.69s -> 498.15s]  You go.
[498.15s -> 501.35s]  Over the table, quick.
[501.35s -> 505.96s]  Don't let him get away.
[505.96s -> 507.96s]  I don't think we can
[507.96s -> 509.96s]  do a whole lot with this dude.
[509.96s -> 511.96s]  I feel like the game has
[511.96s -> 513.96s]  some safety checks in place.
[513.96s -> 515.96s]  This dude wants to be peaceful
[515.96s -> 517.96s]  and we're just trying to run him down with all the horses.
[517.96s -> 520.26s]  All right.
[520.26s -> 522.26s]  That was fun.
[522.26s -> 524.26s]  Yeah, I enjoyed that for all
[524.26s -> 526.26s]  three seconds.
[526.26s -> 528.26s]  There's another thing here.
[528.26s -> 530.26s]  I set a waypoint off.
[530.26s -> 532.26s]  You can see it, but there seems to be a group of people.
[532.26s -> 534.26s]  What are you doing?
[534.26s -> 536.26s]  I just figured I was going to come over here.
[536.26s -> 538.26s]  I'm not a very good driver.
[538.26s -> 540.26s]  My horse does not have
[540.26s -> 542.26s]  the load-bearing potential for this kind of thing, right?
[542.26s -> 544.26s]  It's all right. Trust me.
[544.26s -> 546.26s]  If I drive one of these cars,
[546.26s -> 548.26s]  I'm going into a bench post.
[548.26s -> 550.26s]  All right. Fair enough.
[550.26s -> 556.52s]  So, you know,
[556.52s -> 558.82s]  hot air balloon?
[558.82s -> 560.82s]  Yeah. Pretty much how it works is
[560.82s -> 562.82s]  you go up in the air.
[562.82s -> 564.82s]  And why are these people all ghosts?
[564.82s -> 566.82s]  I don't know. What is this?
[566.82s -> 568.82s]  They're made of vapor.
[568.82s -> 570.82s]  Why are they like Metal Gear Solid
[570.82s -> 572.82s]  invisible? Why are they able to shoot us?
[572.82s -> 574.82s]  Hold on. We'll take care of this.
[574.82s -> 581.80s]  Wait, they're ghosts, but they can shoot us still.
[581.80s -> 583.80s]  How does it
[583.80s -> 585.80s]  make any sense? Kill the NPC.
[585.80s -> 588.04s]  Kill the NPC.
[588.04s -> 590.04s]  Trying.
[590.04s -> 592.04s]  Fuck their flight path giver.
[592.04s -> 594.41s]  Just like the Crossroads back in the early 2000s.
[594.41s -> 596.58s]  The NPC is the Irishman.
[596.58s -> 598.58s]  What's his name?
[598.58s -> 600.58s]  Sean.
[600.58s -> 602.58s]  I don't understand why we can't interact with these guys.
[602.58s -> 604.58s]  They can't interact with us.
[604.58s -> 606.58s]  That seems very unfair.
[606.58s -> 608.58s]  Oh, this is fair.
[608.58s -> 611.85s]  Wait, wait. Did you just do that?
[611.85s -> 614.98s]  Why are ghosts?
[614.98s -> 616.98s]  No, I didn't do that. The ghost bullies
[616.98s -> 618.98s]  are taking care of all this.
[618.98s -> 621.42s]  Alright, well, we found
[621.42s -> 623.72s]  a strange happening here.
[623.72s -> 627.18s]  This online doesn't make
[627.18s -> 629.18s]  a whole lot of sense to me right now.
[629.18s -> 631.18s]  So they're in a different server and they're able to interact with our server.
[631.18s -> 633.18s]  I don't know.
[633.18s -> 635.93s]  There's a
[635.93s -> 637.93s]  mission here, but we can't do it because
[637.93s -> 639.93s]  we're in a danger zone or something.
[639.93s -> 641.93s]  That's too bad. You know what? I was going to
[641.93s -> 643.93s]  sabotage their vehicles.
[643.93s -> 647.05s]  Vehicles? Yeah.
[647.05s -> 649.05s]  I can't even sabotage their vehicles.
[649.05s -> 651.05s]  Oh, that guy got out of
[651.05s -> 653.05s]  the phase for a second. No.
[653.05s -> 655.05s]  I saw that. This is really
[655.05s -> 657.05s]  Westworld shit.
[657.05s -> 659.05s]  Yeah, it's kind of not fair.
[659.05s -> 661.74s]  So hot air balloons, you fill
[661.74s -> 663.74s]  them with air and they go up into the sky.
[663.74s -> 665.74s]  Yeah, and then you eat all the passengers to stay alive.
[665.74s -> 668.17s]  Okay, cool.
[668.17s -> 670.17s]  Oh, I understand.
[670.17s -> 672.17s]  Like in a video game.
[674.17s -> 676.17s]  In one of those video games.
[676.17s -> 678.17s]  What's a video game where you eat stuff
[678.17s -> 680.17s]  when you're
[680.17s -> 682.17s]  traveling?
[682.17s -> 686.14s]  Do you know? Any idea?
[686.14s -> 688.14s]  No.
[688.14s -> 690.89s]  When you fly around...
[690.89s -> 692.89s]  The Oregon Trail. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[692.89s -> 694.89s]  Except that one you drive on.
[694.89s -> 696.89s]  You're on an Oregon
[696.89s -> 698.89s]  on the trail.
[698.89s -> 701.83s]  You know,
[701.83s -> 703.83s]  I don't...
[703.83s -> 705.83s]  That's fucking disgusting. Why would I ever...
[705.83s -> 707.83s]  Oh boy, what have I done?
[707.83s -> 709.83s]  I'm assuming there's a lot
[709.83s -> 711.83s]  to the story that I'm unaware of.
[711.83s -> 713.83s]  So I'm just going to let you do you.
[713.83s -> 715.83s]  No, no, I just...
[715.83s -> 717.83s]  I...
[717.83s -> 720.20s]  It's been a while since I was in the air, so...
[720.20s -> 722.20s]  Jerma, do you have a horse reviver?
[722.20s -> 724.20s]  I think I just killed my horse.
[724.20s -> 726.20s]  I killed mine too.
[726.20s -> 728.20s]  Are you serious?
[728.20s -> 730.20s]  Yeah, I jumped off the cliff. Did you jump off
[730.20s -> 732.20s]  this one? Yeah, I jumped off this one.
[734.57s -> 736.57s]  Oh, now he's...
[736.57s -> 739.13s]  Oh.
[741.75s -> 743.75s]  I hope you have horse insurance.
[743.75s -> 745.75s]  I think I do. Well, whatever. These are like shitty
[745.75s -> 747.75s]  default free ones.
[747.75s -> 749.75s]  Yeah, but I named mine Oatmeal.
[753.21s -> 755.21s]  No, don't shoot oatmeal!
[755.21s -> 757.58s]  There you go.
[757.58s -> 760.78s]  If anything, at least turn him into food.
[760.78s -> 763.14s]  It won't let me stab oatmeal.
[763.14s -> 765.14s]  Well, now we have to walk.
[765.14s -> 767.14s]  Alright, well there's a whole gang hideout
[767.14s -> 769.14s]  over here. You want to go kill some stuff?
[769.14s -> 771.14s]  Let's go light some people up.
[771.14s -> 773.70s]  Okay.
[775.70s -> 777.70s]  Wait a minute.
[777.70s -> 779.70s]  I think I can skin my horse.
[779.70s -> 781.70s]  Can I skin your horse?
[781.70s -> 785.03s]  No.
[785.03s -> 787.40s]  I think these are the bad guys.
[787.40s -> 791.30s]  So we can take this place out.
[791.30s -> 793.30s]  That guy was like a pinball machine.
[793.30s -> 795.93s]  That was pretty good.
[795.93s -> 797.93s]  That was really good.
[797.93s -> 799.93s]  Earn, earn. We got you.
[799.93s -> 802.23s]  That's how a cowboy says yes
[802.23s -> 804.23s]  just in case you didn't know. They say earn, earn.
[804.23s -> 806.23s]  Earn, earn?
[806.23s -> 808.23s]  They say earn, earn.
[808.23s -> 810.41s]  Earn, earn.
[810.41s -> 812.41s]  Minister.
[816.71s -> 820.10s]  No more tears.
[820.10s -> 822.10s]  I just fucking died.
[822.10s -> 824.10s]  I was too busy paying attention to earn, earn.
[824.10s -> 826.10s]  I'm sorry.
[826.10s -> 828.47s]  The local fucking dentist.
[828.47s -> 830.78s]  You know what I mean, earn?
[830.78s -> 833.53s]  I've become a bit of a psychopath
[833.53s -> 837.05s]  it seems.
[837.05s -> 839.05s]  Ernest, Ernest.
[841.05s -> 844.76s]  Alright, I'm coming to rescue you.
[844.76s -> 848.34s]  Don't worry. Don't worry. If you die I got a horse
[848.34s -> 850.65s]  reviver. I'll take care of you.
[850.65s -> 853.08s]  Okay.
[853.08s -> 855.08s]  It works on people too. Same drug.
[855.08s -> 857.58s]  There's only a couple dudes left
[857.58s -> 859.58s]  so we just have to like
[859.58s -> 861.58s]  kill the main dude who's like on the docks
[861.58s -> 863.58s]  I guess. Alright, so you can stab him a hundred times.
[863.58s -> 866.58s]  Watch this.
[866.58s -> 870.98s]  Alright, we got him.
[870.98s -> 873.16s]  Fuck him up.
[873.16s -> 875.53s]  Ooh, that was, okay.
[875.53s -> 878.98s]  He's in the water now.
[878.98s -> 880.98s]  So we split every piece of treasure
[880.98s -> 882.98s]  every treasure chest we find, it's fifty-fifty, right?
[882.98s -> 884.98s]  Yes.
[884.98s -> 887.86s]  This we do.
[887.86s -> 894.26s]  Alright, come watch me stab this guy.
[894.26s -> 896.26s]  Oh, you're fighting the main guy. I'm fighting like his
[896.26s -> 898.26s]  I'm fighting his uncle out here.
[898.26s -> 900.26s]  I just slit his throat.
[900.26s -> 902.26s]  You got the guy with lumbago?
[902.26s -> 905.98s]  Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[905.98s -> 909.88s]  Don't touch anything.
[909.88s -> 912.38s]  How many hats did he have?
[912.38s -> 914.38s]  He only had one and it says you cannot store this hat.
[914.38s -> 916.38s]  Well, we're gonna have to cut it in half.
[916.38s -> 920.09s]  Because that's the only way that's fair.
[920.09s -> 922.09s]  It says here you can get your free Arabian
[922.09s -> 924.09s]  horse from the strawberry stables.
[924.09s -> 926.09s]  Someone in chat said so. If you want to
[926.09s -> 928.09s]  get a non-shitty horse in a bit
[928.09s -> 930.09s]  maybe that'll be a good thing to do on stream.
[930.09s -> 932.09s]  That'll be a good fun thing to do.
[932.09s -> 934.09s]  Is there any
[934.09s -> 936.09s]  loot box in here
[936.09s -> 938.09s]  or something? There's a cabinet.
[938.09s -> 940.09s]  It costs three rock star gold to open, yeah.
[940.09s -> 942.26s]  Once purchased, looted,
[942.26s -> 944.26s]  or crafted consumables. It's so dark over here.
[944.26s -> 947.27s]  Oh, I got a guy.
[947.27s -> 949.90s]  There's a guy in there.
[949.90s -> 951.90s]  Where'd you get that guy from?
[951.90s -> 955.54s]  He was in the cabinet.
[955.54s -> 957.54s]  I guess we just get to take this guy.
[957.54s -> 959.54s]  Maybe we can sell him somewhere?
[959.54s -> 962.10s]  Pretty sure we can do that.
[962.10s -> 964.10s]  Let's do that.
[964.10s -> 966.10s]  I dropped him in the water and
[966.10s -> 968.10s]  you have to bring him to the iPhone store.
[968.10s -> 970.10s]  The water damage is like
[970.10s -> 972.10s]  you just can't fucking recover it.
[972.10s -> 974.10s]  I just got disconnected.
[974.10s -> 976.92s]  And just like that
[976.92s -> 978.92s]  you're gone.
[978.92s -> 980.92s]  Did you get DC'd?
[980.92s -> 982.92s]  I don't know if I got DC'd
[982.92s -> 984.92s]  but I can't loot anybody right now.
[984.92s -> 986.92s]  The cycle never ends.
[986.92s -> 989.42s]  You would think
[989.42s -> 991.42s]  Vegas would have good internet.
[991.42s -> 993.42s]  I got
[993.42s -> 995.42s]  a greater internet at the moment.
[995.42s -> 997.42s]  For some reason my connection to rock star
[997.42s -> 1002.28s]  I don't know why.
[1002.28s -> 1007.06s]  This is what was happening to me before too.
[1007.06s -> 1009.06s]  Are you still in the game?
[1009.06s -> 1011.06s]  I'm still in game.
[1011.06s -> 1013.50s]  Let me know when you're back online.
[1013.50s -> 1018.10s]  I can invite you.
[1018.10s -> 1020.10s]  What the...
[1020.10s -> 1022.41s]  Can I swear?
[1022.41s -> 1024.41s]  I swear a little.
[1024.41s -> 1027.67s]  Shit.
[1027.67s -> 1029.67s]  What the shit?
[1029.67s -> 1032.94s]  I'm sorry.
[1032.94s -> 1034.94s]  By rights we shouldn't even be friends.
[1034.94s -> 1036.94s]  I'm a New York Yankees guy.
[1036.94s -> 1038.94s]  What?
[1038.94s -> 1040.94s]  What?
[1040.94s -> 1044.20s]  I can't believe you
[1044.20s -> 1046.20s]  just fucking said that.
[1046.20s -> 1049.91s]  The truth is though
[1049.91s -> 1051.91s]  I don't really care.
[1051.91s -> 1053.91s]  I was told I was a Yankees fan when I was a child.
[1053.91s -> 1055.91s]  I was told
[1055.91s -> 1057.91s]  I was a Yankees fan.
[1057.91s -> 1059.91s]  I was told that I was.
[1059.91s -> 1061.91s]  You know
[1061.91s -> 1063.91s]  watched a couple games here and there.
[1063.91s -> 1066.34s]  I'm supposed to be angry at you
[1066.34s -> 1068.34s]  according to the laws of thermodynamics.
[1068.34s -> 1070.78s]  I mean that's
[1070.78s -> 1073.98s]  okay.
[1073.98s -> 1075.98s]  Being a Yankee fan
[1075.98s -> 1077.98s]  obviously
[1077.98s -> 1079.98s]  there's something wrong with you.
[1079.98s -> 1081.98s]  Right, of course there is.
[1081.98s -> 1083.98s]  If you go to the doctor
[1083.98s -> 1085.98s]  and you tell the doctor
[1085.98s -> 1087.98s]  when they do a physical exam
[1087.98s -> 1089.98s]  one of the first things they have to ask you is
[1089.98s -> 1091.98s]  still a baseball fan?
[1091.98s -> 1093.98s]  Yeah, yeah I am.
[1093.98s -> 1095.98s]  Yankees? Red Sox? Which one?
[1095.98s -> 1097.98s]  Because it's very important.
[1097.98s -> 1099.98s]  You get a CT scan for that.
[1099.98s -> 1102.22s]  They have to check your whole body
[1102.22s -> 1104.22s]  and make sure it's not like an ulcer
[1104.22s -> 1106.22s]  or something. That could be what's causing it.
[1106.22s -> 1108.22s]  I think
[1108.22s -> 1110.22s]  it's the Lumbego again though.
[1110.22s -> 1113.03s]  Pretty sure.
[1113.03s -> 1115.03s]  What is Lumbego?
[1115.03s -> 1117.03s]  So the uncle character in this game
[1117.03s -> 1119.03s]  says that he has a killer case of Lumbego
[1119.03s -> 1121.03s]  and apparently what that is
[1121.03s -> 1123.03s]  is just his lower back hurts.
[1123.03s -> 1125.03s]  So it's his lower back pain.
[1125.03s -> 1127.03s]  I like to blame a lot of my failings
[1127.03s -> 1129.03s]  on Lumbego these days.
[1129.03s -> 1131.03s]  Am I in your game?
[1131.03s -> 1133.03s]  I might even just be in your game.
[1133.03s -> 1136.10s]  Am I in here?
[1136.10s -> 1138.10s]  Am I with you?
[1138.10s -> 1140.10s]  No, I'm sending you another invite.
[1140.10s -> 1142.10s]  Doesn't look like you're in here.
[1142.10s -> 1144.10s]  Oh god, this guy is going to kill me.
[1144.10s -> 1146.34s]  I hope I can portal out of here.
[1146.34s -> 1148.34s]  Lethal hog. Processing invite.
[1148.34s -> 1150.34s]  Okay, thank god.
[1150.34s -> 1152.65s]  This guy in his whole posse
[1152.65s -> 1154.65s]  was medicinally walking around me
[1154.65s -> 1156.65s]  with their guns out.
[1156.65s -> 1160.87s]  Just portal to it out of the way.
[1160.87s -> 1163.24s]  Were they ghosts?
[1163.24s -> 1165.24s]  No, they were just bandits.
[1165.24s -> 1167.24s]  Okay, because I think that might be
[1167.24s -> 1169.24s]  a glimpse at the DLC.
[1169.24s -> 1171.24s]  Ghost cowboys. We had zombies in the
[1171.24s -> 1173.24s]  previous game and it'll just be ghosts this time around.
[1173.24s -> 1175.24s]  I wonder what their plan is.
[1175.24s -> 1177.24s]  Do they have no plan at all?
[1177.24s -> 1180.42s]  Think?
[1180.42s -> 1182.42s]  Yeah, they have a plan. The plan is to continue
[1182.42s -> 1184.42s]  implementing weapons and cosmetic items
[1184.42s -> 1186.42s]  and selling gold bars
[1186.42s -> 1188.42s]  that you can then buy them with.
[1188.42s -> 1190.42s]  Did you know that
[1190.42s -> 1192.42s]  one of the dudes at Rockstar
[1192.42s -> 1194.42s]  or was it Take Two or something
[1194.42s -> 1196.42s]  said that they didn't feel GTA Online was monetized
[1196.42s -> 1198.42s]  enough? Wait, is that for real?
[1198.42s -> 1200.42s]  Yeah, apparently. Somebody actually said that?
[1200.42s -> 1202.42s]  Yeah.
[1202.42s -> 1206.20s]  And I like Rockstar.
[1206.20s -> 1208.20s]  And they're really good to me. And I think
[1208.20s -> 1210.20s]  that that's ridiculous. That was a highly
[1210.20s -> 1212.20s]  monetized game. What the?
[1212.20s -> 1215.14s]  I think I'm in your game.
[1215.14s -> 1217.14s]  But I don't think I'm in your posse. Is this you up here?
[1217.14s -> 1219.14s]  Hold on. I don't know. Let me just
[1219.14s -> 1221.14s]  make sure.
[1221.14s -> 1223.64s]  Strauss said that. There you go.
[1223.64s -> 1226.07s]  Yeah.
[1226.07s -> 1228.07s]  Yeah, I'm right next to you. Telling that there's a character
[1228.07s -> 1230.07s]  that is a loan shark in this game
[1230.07s -> 1232.07s]  called Strauss.
[1232.07s -> 1237.30s]  Just want to make sure he was dead.
[1237.30s -> 1239.30s]  Hey.
[1239.30s -> 1241.30s]  Thank you.
[1241.30s -> 1243.30s]  Wasn't there
[1243.30s -> 1245.30s]  an Activision
[1245.30s -> 1247.30s]  executive that said they wished they
[1247.30s -> 1249.30s]  could sell a controller that was like $150
[1249.30s -> 1251.30s]  or if they
[1251.30s -> 1253.30s]  could sell their games for like double, they would do it
[1253.30s -> 1255.30s]  if they could get away with it or something.
[1255.30s -> 1257.30s]  I think so. Yeah, I seem to remember.
[1257.30s -> 1259.30s]  I don't know for sure, but that sounds familiar.
[1259.30s -> 1261.30s]  That was a couple years ago, no? Yeah.
[1261.30s -> 1263.30s]  Something ridiculous like that.
[1263.30s -> 1265.54s]  It's just it's a gift
[1265.54s -> 1267.54s]  that keeps on giving. It really is.
[1267.54s -> 1269.54s]  All right.
[1269.54s -> 1271.54s]  I'm trying to join your posse.
[1271.54s -> 1273.54s]  I got you the invite now.
[1273.54s -> 1277.06s]  There's someone mad at me.
[1277.06s -> 1279.06s]  So if someone appears over the ridge and tries to shoot
[1279.06s -> 1281.06s]  us, then
[1281.06s -> 1283.06s]  that's my fault.
[1283.06s -> 1285.06s]  All right. So where's this free horse?
[1285.06s -> 1287.06s]  Is that your horse?
[1287.06s -> 1289.06s]  Yeah, it is. I guess it is now.
[1289.06s -> 1291.06s]  I guess it is yours now.
[1291.06s -> 1293.06s]  So Valentine,
[1293.06s -> 1295.06s]  I'll set a waypoint. Set a waypoint for us.
[1295.06s -> 1297.06s]  And by the way, there
[1297.06s -> 1299.06s]  is- Wait, wait. Valentine chat?
[1299.06s -> 1303.61s]  Oh, okay.
[1303.61s -> 1305.61s]  There's like a 90 to 95 percent
[1305.61s -> 1307.61s]  chance that I'm going to dump us.
[1307.61s -> 1309.61s]  What's that?
[1309.61s -> 1311.61s]  Is that the guy that was trying to fight you?
[1311.61s -> 1314.92s]  That's my horse.
[1314.92s -> 1316.92s]  Why was it just angry? It just had like a
[1316.92s -> 1318.92s]  blip on the screen. Really?
[1318.92s -> 1320.92s]  Yeah, it was a red blip. No, I don't
[1320.92s -> 1323.22s]  know. That was weird.
[1323.22s -> 1325.98s]  Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[1325.98s -> 1327.98s]  Watch this, they're going to go
[1327.98s -> 1331.62s]  bowling. They're fast
[1331.62s -> 1333.62s]  though. These horses are real fucking
[1333.62s -> 1337.40s]  shitty. These pins.
[1337.40s -> 1339.40s]  So Jeremy, are you going to Pax East
[1339.40s -> 1341.40s]  this year, even though you now live halfway across
[1341.40s -> 1343.40s]  the country? More than halfway.
[1343.40s -> 1345.40s]  I am not.
[1345.40s -> 1347.40s]  Not going to Pax East this year.
[1347.40s -> 1349.40s]  Unfortunately. I had to
[1349.40s -> 1351.40s]  check. I just wanted to know. Are you chasing after
[1351.40s -> 1353.40s]  this guy? No, I'm just
[1353.40s -> 1355.40s]  trying to head to Valentine.
[1355.40s -> 1357.77s]  Yeah, not this year.
[1357.77s -> 1360.46s]  Vinny, are you going to Pax East?
[1360.46s -> 1362.46s]  I will be there in body
[1362.46s -> 1365.08s]  but not in spirit.
[1365.08s -> 1367.51s]  So no.
[1367.51s -> 1370.01s]  Because your spirit
[1370.01s -> 1372.01s]  is what controls the body. The body is just a
[1372.01s -> 1374.01s]  big case.
[1374.01s -> 1376.01s]  Yeah, it's like
[1376.01s -> 1378.01s]  a meat machine.
[1378.01s -> 1380.01s]  So you're sending your horse hair cooler master
[1380.01s -> 1382.01s]  to Pax.
[1382.01s -> 1384.01s]  That's correct.
[1384.01s -> 1386.25s]  I need a new keyboard for this
[1386.25s -> 1388.25s]  fucking game.
[1388.25s -> 1390.25s]  And I need some more memory because, man, I am
[1390.25s -> 1392.25s]  running out.
[1392.25s -> 1394.25s]  I've got to learn how to laugh without being a disgusting
[1394.25s -> 1396.49s]  human being.
[1396.49s -> 1398.49s]  Me just laughing right there.
[1398.49s -> 1400.49s]  What was my horse doing?
[1400.49s -> 1402.49s]  What the fuck?
[1402.49s -> 1405.05s]  He just ran over my
[1405.05s -> 1410.62s]  head.
[1410.62s -> 1412.62s]  That was good. Keep it up.
[1412.62s -> 1414.62s]  I need to feed him.
[1414.62s -> 1416.98s]  Oh, carrots.
[1416.98s -> 1418.98s]  Where's the horse food? Oh, that's right.
[1418.98s -> 1420.98s]  I can feed him my clothes.
[1420.98s -> 1422.98s]  I barely have anything to feed this fucking
[1422.98s -> 1432.78s]  thing.
[1432.78s -> 1434.78s]  Are you trying to shoot that guy? Yeah, I tried.
[1434.78s -> 1437.21s]  But yeah, what I'm saying is
[1437.21s -> 1439.21s]  people must hate
[1439.21s -> 1441.21s]  talking to me. Okay, so let me ask
[1441.21s -> 1443.21s]  you something. We like hung out.
[1443.21s -> 1445.21s]  We hung out in person.
[1445.21s -> 1447.21s]  In person.
[1447.21s -> 1449.21s]  When I like laughed at something, did I just
[1449.21s -> 1451.21s]  like sprinkle or spit in
[1451.21s -> 1453.21s]  your face? No. Okay.
[1453.21s -> 1455.21s]  I don't know what it is about sitting here, but every time I laugh, I just like
[1455.21s -> 1457.21s]  droplets of water just all over my
[1457.21s -> 1459.21s]  screen. I'm not even sipping anything.
[1459.21s -> 1461.21s]  I don't understand how.
[1461.21s -> 1463.21s]  You know, I have a weird
[1463.21s -> 1465.21s]  confession to make. Okay.
[1465.21s -> 1467.21s]  So my Wii U gamepad, the screen
[1467.21s -> 1469.21s]  is like
[1469.21s -> 1471.21s]  is kind of gross. That's like
[1471.21s -> 1473.21s]  four years of streaming it and speaking
[1473.21s -> 1475.21s]  in front of it. And I thought I didn't
[1475.21s -> 1477.21s]  spit when I spoke or laugh.
[1477.21s -> 1479.21s]  I was clearly extremely
[1479.21s -> 1481.21s]  mistaken. So I think this is just being
[1481.21s -> 1483.21s]  a human. This is just faulty hardware.
[1483.21s -> 1485.21s]  Something that we all share.
[1485.21s -> 1487.21s]  No, I think you're honest in there because
[1487.21s -> 1489.21s]  it's gonna happen again. Don't you do it.
[1489.21s -> 1491.21s]  Okay, we're fine. This horse
[1491.21s -> 1493.21s]  sucks. I'd rather just ride on yours.
[1495.45s -> 1497.45s]  You can if you want. My
[1497.45s -> 1499.45s]  oatmeal is a sturdy horse
[1499.45s -> 1501.45s]  firm, I guess. But also the
[1501.45s -> 1503.45s]  frame rates are dipping. Are you getting like weird frame rates?
[1503.45s -> 1505.45s]  Oh yeah, it's bad. It's like
[1505.45s -> 1507.45s]  20 frames a second. Yeah, what's
[1507.45s -> 1509.45s]  going on? I feel like I'm playing Ocarina of Time again.
[1509.45s -> 1511.45s]  Uh, but I think
[1511.45s -> 1513.45s]  that's just like a hill. Let me like transfer.
[1513.45s -> 1516.07s]  Let me transfer.
[1516.07s -> 1518.07s]  I think that's just a
[1518.07s -> 1520.57s]  almost a tree.
[1520.57s -> 1522.57s]  Just hang on a minute, okay? Yeah. Where's your horse?
[1522.57s -> 1526.28s]  Take care of it.
[1526.28s -> 1528.28s]  Wait, you're killing him. You just killed my horse?
[1528.28s -> 1530.28s]  No, no, I
[1530.28s -> 1532.28s]  wouldn't let me. We're friends.
[1532.28s -> 1534.28s]  Tidge wouldn't let me. Yeah,
[1534.28s -> 1536.71s]  I tried.
[1536.71s -> 1538.71s]  But you haven't noticed that, I don't know, do you have like an iPad
[1538.71s -> 1540.71s]  or anything? I don't have
[1540.71s -> 1543.02s]  any, um, no.
[1543.02s -> 1545.02s]  Even like the Switch or the Wii U,
[1545.02s -> 1547.02s]  you're right there, but for some
[1547.02s -> 1549.02s]  reason, it's the most embarrassing thing in the world.
[1549.02s -> 1551.02s]  Even your phone too. If somebody
[1551.02s -> 1553.02s]  ever is like, hey, can I use your phone?
[1553.02s -> 1555.02s]  It's just like, oh fuck, and you look at it and
[1555.02s -> 1557.02s]  it's just like, oh, and I was like, I was like shitting and like
[1557.02s -> 1559.02s]  using this. I gotta like wipe it off. I gotta like
[1559.02s -> 1561.02s]  pissing and
[1561.02s -> 1563.02s]  There's particles.
[1563.02s -> 1565.02s]  There's particles, whether you want there to be or not,
[1565.02s -> 1567.02s]  there's particles. And nobody wants, nobody
[1567.02s -> 1569.02s]  wants you to, if there's a screen involved,
[1569.02s -> 1571.02s]  you never want
[1571.02s -> 1573.02s]  someone to touch it or look at it.
[1573.02s -> 1575.90s]  Anytime somebody wants to, oh, can I use your iPad
[1575.90s -> 1578.65s]  for a second? Well, that person didn't
[1578.65s -> 1580.65s]  let us use their iPad.
[1580.65s -> 1586.41s]  Fuck. Maybe there are horses
[1586.41s -> 1588.41s]  better. I can't steal it.
[1588.41s -> 1592.95s]  We can't take it?
[1592.95s -> 1594.95s]  Oh, hey.
[1594.95s -> 1597.83s]  Calm it down,
[1597.83s -> 1599.83s]  calm down, calm down, calm down.
[1599.83s -> 1601.83s]  Alright, let's get out of here before they get mad at us.
[1601.83s -> 1603.83s]  No, no, I'm talking about the horse. I calmed the horse down. This thing is cool.
[1603.83s -> 1606.14s]  We need to take this thing.
[1606.14s -> 1608.14s]  I don't think we can. I think it's, it's got a
[1608.14s -> 1610.14s]  saddle on it. That thing tried to kick you
[1610.14s -> 1614.68s]  by the way.
[1614.68s -> 1618.58s]  Well, that person's head is still bleeding.
[1618.58s -> 1622.30s]  I can't wait to get our cool, oh, there they are,
[1622.30s -> 1625.18s]  they're there. Alright,
[1625.18s -> 1627.18s]  line it up. I'm jumping to the horse.
[1630.18s -> 1632.18s]  Not even necessary.
[1632.18s -> 1634.49s]  Nope, none of this
[1634.49s -> 1636.49s]  is necessary. I told you, I'm not a good guy.
[1636.49s -> 1638.49s]  I am morally as
[1638.49s -> 1640.49s]  gray as you can get. This is your, this is
[1640.49s -> 1642.49s]  good guy, right?
[1642.49s -> 1644.66s]  I'm a good guy, yeah. No, that's what,
[1644.66s -> 1646.66s]  good, we,
[1646.66s -> 1648.90s]  what's bad about it?
[1648.90s -> 1650.90s]  They are bad. We're killing the bad guys.
[1650.90s -> 1655.13s]  That's what I'm saying. So,
[1655.13s -> 1657.13s]  oh, oh, oh, here, in regards to the
[1657.13s -> 1659.13s]  discussion that we just had about touchscreens,
[1659.13s -> 1661.13s]  did you know that they did,
[1661.13s -> 1663.13s]  I don't know who they is,
[1663.13s -> 1665.13s]  but they did some tests
[1665.13s -> 1667.13s]  on McDonald's touchscreens
[1667.13s -> 1669.13s]  for ordering, and they determined that
[1669.13s -> 1671.13s]  there is poo on every one of the ones
[1671.13s -> 1673.13s]  that they tested. Oh,
[1673.13s -> 1675.13s]  that's, that's fucking
[1675.13s -> 1677.13s]  disgusting.
[1677.13s -> 1679.37s]  Nice jump, by the way.
[1679.37s -> 1682.63s]  Yeah. I'm
[1682.63s -> 1684.63s]  sorry, man, but I'm of the opinion, that doesn't really
[1684.63s -> 1686.63s]  gross me out because I feel like there's poo
[1686.63s -> 1688.63s]  everywhere. Yeah, there is poo
[1688.63s -> 1690.63s]  everywhere. As Bruce Willis once said, there's always
[1690.63s -> 1692.63s]  a little shit in the meat. I mean, like
[1692.63s -> 1694.63s]  there's probably, there's probably shit on your hands
[1694.63s -> 1696.63s]  right now. Yeah.
[1696.63s -> 1698.63s]  No, I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, you know, little
[1698.63s -> 1700.63s]  microbes.
[1700.63s -> 1702.63s]  I mean, if you test the oxygen around you, it's
[1702.63s -> 1704.63s]  probably like point one percent poo.
[1704.63s -> 1706.63s]  And you just look down and it's like, oh my
[1706.63s -> 1708.63s]  god. My hands
[1708.63s -> 1710.63s]  are covered in shit. I look
[1710.63s -> 1712.63s]  down and my controller is just filled
[1712.63s -> 1715.32s]  with turds.
[1715.32s -> 1717.50s]  That would be disgusting. I'm getting
[1717.50s -> 1719.50s]  someone just said, Vinnie, I'm getting sick.
[1719.50s -> 1721.50s]  I'm sorry, chat member. You didn't deserve that.
[1721.50s -> 1723.74s]  How much vomit
[1723.74s -> 1725.74s]  particulates do you believe are floating
[1725.74s -> 1727.74s]  around at any given moment? Well,
[1727.74s -> 1729.74s]  to be, I'll be completely honest, at least
[1729.74s -> 1731.74s]  a few dozen here because I, when you said you were a
[1731.74s -> 1733.74s]  Yankees fan, I threw up into my glass. So
[1733.74s -> 1735.74s]  Oh, good point. That did happen.
[1735.74s -> 1737.74s]  How did you feel about
[1737.74s -> 1739.74s]  I mean, are you, I don't know, I don't remember
[1739.74s -> 1741.74s]  if we talked about this when we were in Boston, but are
[1741.74s -> 1743.74s]  you a big enough baseball fan to have really felt
[1743.74s -> 1745.74s]  like a dopamine hit when
[1745.74s -> 1747.74s]  they won? Um, no.
[1747.74s -> 1749.74s]  Because I took the ultimate
[1749.74s -> 1753.00s]  drug in 2004. Jesus.
[1753.00s -> 1755.00s]  Jesus.
[1755.00s -> 1757.00s]  I found Jesus.
[1757.00s -> 1759.00s]  Oh, no, really?
[1759.00s -> 1761.00s]  What did you hit?
[1761.00s -> 1763.00s]  When the Red Sox won the World Series for the first
[1763.00s -> 1765.00s]  time in like a hundred years. Oh, okay.
[1765.00s -> 1767.00s]  That was 2004 was like the magical
[1767.00s -> 1769.00s]  year and no other drug could ever
[1769.00s -> 1771.00s]  come close.
[1771.00s -> 1773.00s]  2007 was pretty good too because
[1773.00s -> 1775.00s]  one of my favorite players was on the
[1775.00s -> 1777.00s]  World Series with 2007 and
[1777.00s -> 1779.00s]  you know, that team
[1779.00s -> 1781.00s]  I think was a really great team. But then
[1781.00s -> 1783.00s]  2013, it was like, oh, okay.
[1783.00s -> 1785.00s]  Man, this is
[1785.00s -> 1787.00s]  Red Sox are so good this third time
[1787.00s -> 1789.00s]  in like less than 10 years.
[1789.00s -> 1791.00s]  And then this last one, it's like the best team they've ever
[1791.00s -> 1793.00s]  had in history of the history of the entire
[1793.00s -> 1795.00s]  franchise. And it's like, yeah.
[1795.00s -> 1797.00s]  Man, I wish I could get that 2004
[1797.00s -> 1799.00s]  drug bill.
[1799.00s -> 1801.00s]  Right, right. It just gets less. It's like
[1801.00s -> 1803.00s]  when the Yankees won a bunch in
[1803.00s -> 1805.00s]  a row in the
[1805.00s -> 1807.00s]  late 90s and it was just getting boring.
[1807.00s -> 1809.00s]  And then when they didn't win, it was like, well, fuck, I wanted a day
[1809.00s -> 1811.00s]  off from school.
[1811.00s -> 1813.00s]  It wasn't even like special anymore. It was just
[1813.00s -> 1815.00s]  where's my day off? Because they were giving us a day off when the Yankees
[1815.00s -> 1817.00s]  won. Really?
[1817.00s -> 1819.00s]  Yeah, they did. For the parade.
[1819.00s -> 1821.00s]  You could choose not to go and they wouldn't be upset.
[1821.00s -> 1823.00s]  Wow.
[1823.00s -> 1825.00s]  Uh huh. So where's our free horse?
[1825.00s -> 1827.24s]  Um, hey chat.
[1827.24s -> 1830.94s]  Was that a jape?
[1830.94s -> 1833.50s]  Did you guys, uh...
[1833.50s -> 1835.80s]  Were you just joking with us the whole time, huh?
[1835.80s -> 1837.80s]  No. The free horse is in strawberry.
[1837.80s -> 1841.06s]  Jeremy, I have a
[1841.06s -> 1843.30s]  I have a confession. What is it?
[1843.30s -> 1845.30s]  I took us to the wrong town. Oh.
[1845.30s -> 1847.86s]  It's okay.
[1847.86s -> 1849.86s]  Because I go to the wrong town literally
[1849.86s -> 1851.86s]  every time I play the game. So.
[1851.86s -> 1854.68s]  Okay. Um, we have to go to strawberry.
[1854.68s -> 1857.75s]  Wait, wait, can we take a, um,
[1857.75s -> 1859.75s]  take a fast travel? I think it costs money.
[1859.75s -> 1862.87s]  What's this horse? Did I get a...
[1862.87s -> 1864.87s]  Oh, this is the horse that I got from... Okay, yeah.
[1864.87s -> 1867.43s]  So this is my actual horse.
[1867.43s -> 1869.43s]  There's one with the frame rates in multiplayer.
[1869.43s -> 1871.43s]  Jesus. Yeah, they're pretty bad.
[1871.43s -> 1874.70s]  Um, I'm gonna
[1874.70s -> 1876.70s]  attempt to do the stagecoach and see how long that takes.
[1876.70s -> 1878.70s]  And how much money
[1878.70s -> 1880.70s]  it costs to fast travel. Oh, yeah, yeah.
[1880.70s -> 1883.26s]  That's probably a good idea.
[1883.26s -> 1885.26s]  It's under buy horses superior.
[1885.26s -> 1887.26s]  But it's only in strawberry. Only in
[1887.26s -> 1891.61s]  strawberry. How far away is that from here?
[1891.61s -> 1893.61s]  That's not that far. It's not too bad.
[1893.61s -> 1895.61s]  It's not terrible. Vinny, no. Hang on.
[1895.61s -> 1897.61s]  Wait, wait, wait. Only strawberry.
[1897.61s -> 1899.61s]  No. In any stables. Only strawberry.
[1899.61s -> 1901.61s]  Any stable. Only
[1901.61s -> 1903.61s]  strawberry. I hate life sometimes.
[1903.61s -> 1905.61s]  Okay, I'm gonna go back to this and I'm gonna let you know.
[1905.61s -> 1907.61s]  Eat the raspberries, Vinny.
[1907.61s -> 1909.61s]  That's what they say.
[1909.61s -> 1911.61s]  Eat those raspberries. Don't eat them.
[1911.61s -> 1913.61s]  They're not poisonous. Those raspberries
[1913.61s -> 1915.61s]  in front of you are not poisonous. Yes, they are.
[1915.61s -> 1917.61s]  They're poisonous. Like,
[1917.61s -> 1919.61s]  I've talked about this on my stream before, but let me
[1919.61s -> 1921.61s]  see how you feel about this.
[1921.61s -> 1923.61s]  If you were in a room and
[1923.61s -> 1925.61s]  there were a hundred people
[1925.61s -> 1927.61s]  outside, like we're talking like a two-way
[1927.61s -> 1929.61s]  mirror, like glass, right? You're sitting in like
[1929.61s -> 1932.10s]  a interrogation room.
[1932.10s -> 1934.10s]  And a guy comes in and puts
[1934.10s -> 1936.10s]  berries down in front of you.
[1936.10s -> 1938.10s]  They're like
[1938.10s -> 1940.10s]  red. Just red berries on the little
[1940.10s -> 1942.86s]  plate and he leaves the room. Are you going to eat
[1942.86s -> 1944.86s]  them if you hear fifty
[1944.86s -> 1946.86s]  percent of the people screaming, don't eat those.
[1946.86s -> 1948.86s]  They're poisonous from the other room.
[1948.86s -> 1950.86s]  Or eat them. They'll give you superpowers. Don't listen
[1950.86s -> 1955.91s]  to them. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna eat them?
[1955.91s -> 1957.91s]  How depressed am I before I enter this room?
[1957.91s -> 1959.91s]  Today was a great day.
[1959.91s -> 1962.66s]  Like, today was a fantastic day.
[1962.66s -> 1965.03s]  One of the best you probably had all week.
[1965.03s -> 1970.01s]  Did Smash come out yet?
[1970.01s -> 1972.01s]  Yeah, Smash came out.
[1972.01s -> 1974.01s]  And Gino got confirmed for DLC.
[1980.84s -> 1982.84s]  Okay, I won't eat the berries then. You won't eat them?
[1982.84s -> 1984.84s]  Alright. No. Alright, so when you push that
[1984.84s -> 1986.84s]  away, half of the people in the other room
[1986.84s -> 1988.84s]  are screaming at you.
[1988.84s -> 1991.72s]  And they're very upset with you. And like your
[1991.72s -> 1993.72s]  day gets worse because as you're walking out
[1993.72s -> 1995.72s]  there's like drinks are getting thrown at you.
[1995.72s -> 1998.02s]  There's like fruits that are flying by your head.
[1998.02s -> 2000.02s]  Like, you should have eaten yours, you fucking idiot.
[2000.02s -> 2002.02s]  And like somebody drives by and throws like a large soda at you.
[2002.02s -> 2007.40s]  God, this is tough. What would
[2007.40s -> 2010.15s]  you do?
[2010.15s -> 2012.15s]  I wouldn't do it. No, I don't think so.
[2012.15s -> 2015.61s]  I mean, super powers sound cool
[2015.61s -> 2017.61s]  and everything, but isn't God much
[2017.61s -> 2019.61s]  more cooler?
[2019.61s -> 2021.61s]  Alright, I'm gonna sell oatmeal. Goodbye oatmeal.
[2021.61s -> 2023.61s]  Why are you selling your
[2023.61s -> 2025.61s]  horse? I liked oatmeal because
[2025.61s -> 2027.61s]  it was a cool name, but someone else can have oatmeal.
[2027.61s -> 2029.61s]  There's a free horse in here, dude. There's a free horse in there?
[2029.61s -> 2031.61s]  Yeah, there's a free horse.
[2031.61s -> 2035.00s]  Did you just like ram
[2035.00s -> 2037.00s]  into the fucking stables at full speed?
[2037.00s -> 2039.00s]  Because I saw that on the
[2039.00s -> 2041.00s]  cutscene.
[2041.00s -> 2043.00s]  Alright, go to buy horse,
[2043.00s -> 2045.00s]  go to superior at the bottom,
[2045.00s -> 2047.00s]  Arabian, red chestnut,
[2047.00s -> 2049.88s]  and you can claim a free
[2049.88s -> 2052.18s]  horse. Your stable is full?
[2052.18s -> 2054.18s]  Yeah, you gotta sell your other horse.
[2054.18s -> 2056.49s]  How much did you get for selling that one?
[2056.49s -> 2058.49s]  Next to nothing.
[2058.49s -> 2060.92s]  My horse's name is Sean.
[2060.92s -> 2065.58s]  Alright, sorry.
[2065.58s -> 2067.58s]  Someone said name it Bagel.
[2067.58s -> 2071.27s]  Name it Nut. Oh, that's a good
[2071.27s -> 2073.27s]  idea. I'll name it Nut. People are gonna be so upset
[2073.27s -> 2075.83s]  I'm about to sell this horse.
[2075.83s -> 2077.83s]  Yeah, my audience was not happy.
[2077.83s -> 2080.78s]  Oh, by the way,
[2080.78s -> 2082.78s]  why don't we do a quick plug? I want to plug your
[2082.78s -> 2084.78s]  stream. If anyone wants to see what's going on, or
[2084.78s -> 2086.78s]  do like a multi-stream and watch Jerma
[2086.78s -> 2088.95s]  stream too, you can go to Twitch.tv
[2088.95s -> 2091.45s]  slash Jerma.
[2093.75s -> 2095.75s]  That's good enough.
[2095.75s -> 2097.75s]  They'll find me. Sure. Twitch.tv
[2097.75s -> 2100.38s]  slash Jerma. Yeah, it's
[2100.38s -> 2102.38s]  J-H-E-R-R-H-H-H.
[2102.38s -> 2104.74s]  Twitch.tv slash.
[2104.74s -> 2106.74s]  Because there's numbers, right? At the end.
[2106.74s -> 2108.74s]  Yeah, I'm one of those idiots that has numbers.
[2108.74s -> 2111.75s]  Jerma985, J-H-E-R-M-A-985.
[2111.75s -> 2113.75s]  And if anybody over here that wants to go check out
[2113.75s -> 2117.02s]  Vinnie. Yeah, you
[2117.02s -> 2119.02s]  could go to Twitch.tv
[2119.02s -> 2121.02s]  slash. Yeah.
[2121.02s -> 2123.02s]  This is like four H's.
[2123.02s -> 2126.60s]  Vine. Vine
[2126.60s -> 2129.74s]  sauce. That is correct.
[2129.74s -> 2132.36s]  You know, multi-stream us.
[2132.36s -> 2134.54s]  You know what I'm saying? Yeah, there's
[2134.54s -> 2136.54s]  gonna be a way to do that natively
[2136.54s -> 2138.54s]  soon enough, like Twitch is implemented
[2138.54s -> 2140.54s]  or they're working on implementing a way to do that.
[2140.54s -> 2143.29s]  So that way
[2143.29s -> 2145.78s]  you can just enjoy other
[2145.78s -> 2147.78s]  streamers without having to go to like a multi-stream website.
[2147.78s -> 2150.09s]  So I think that's kind of cool.
[2150.09s -> 2152.09s]  Yeah. That's kind of, that's very
[2152.09s -> 2155.03s]  necessary. Yeah. I think it's
[2155.03s -> 2157.59s]  a great idea. I'm surprised it hasn't happened sooner.
[2157.59s -> 2161.62s]  There we go. Alright, so I got my free
[2161.62s -> 2164.89s]  horse. Thank God. There's
[2164.89s -> 2166.89s]  a couple free saddles available.
[2166.89s -> 2169.26s]  Yeah. I'm looking
[2169.26s -> 2171.26s]  at some of the stuff right now. 80
[2171.26s -> 2173.75s]  bucks. How are you ever gonna get like
[2173.75s -> 2175.75s]  more than five gold bars in this game?
[2175.75s -> 2177.75s]  How is that impossible?
[2177.75s -> 2179.75s]  Oh, I know how it's possible.
[2181.75s -> 2183.75s]  There was a big drama post about how
[2183.75s -> 2185.75s]  someone was like, they did the math and to earn
[2185.75s -> 2187.75s]  enough money to buy another
[2187.75s -> 2189.75s]  stable or like, you know, a horse.
[2189.75s -> 2191.93s]  A good horse. They said it was something
[2191.93s -> 2193.93s]  like 80 hours.
[2193.93s -> 2195.93s]  And then that was disproven. I mean, they got the
[2195.93s -> 2197.93s]  math wrong and it was like seven hours instead.
[2197.93s -> 2200.17s]  Oh, I don't want to
[2200.17s -> 2202.17s]  cause you any alarm here.
[2202.17s -> 2204.47s]  But horse insurance
[2204.47s -> 2206.47s]  for this horse is five gold bars
[2206.47s -> 2209.10s]  that I don't have. Found out that the
[2209.10s -> 2211.10s]  horses come back no matter what. The insurance
[2211.10s -> 2213.10s]  just makes them more healthy. Oh,
[2213.10s -> 2216.49s]  okay. So you can't
[2216.49s -> 2218.49s]  if you have an owned horse and multiplayer,
[2218.49s -> 2221.74s]  you're good. Okay, that's good.
[2221.74s -> 2225.13s]  But yeah, you definitely
[2225.13s -> 2227.13s]  want to get another saddle because
[2227.13s -> 2229.82s]  there's some really good ones.
[2229.82s -> 2231.82s]  So what you do is go to empty slot,
[2231.82s -> 2233.82s]  attack one of them, and then
[2233.82s -> 2235.82s]  special. Oh, you got it? Yeah, I got one.
[2235.82s -> 2239.59s]  Okay, cool. I don't know why these are free.
[2239.59s -> 2241.90s]  Are these all for free?
[2241.90s -> 2245.29s]  I mean, I can't buy them though. Some of them.
[2245.29s -> 2247.29s]  Oh, some of them. Did you get the couple
[2247.29s -> 2250.10s]  free ones or? This one's 39.
[2250.10s -> 2252.47s]  Which one is the free one? This one's 67.
[2252.47s -> 2254.71s]  It should just be 00.
[2254.71s -> 2257.91s]  Oh, I doubt it's special. Okay, I see.
[2257.91s -> 2260.28s]  Alligator Ranch. Yeah, I'll get this one.
[2260.28s -> 2263.74s]  The very last one at the end is really
[2263.74s -> 2269.22s]  good. Let's see. Rattlesnake.
[2269.22s -> 2273.05s]  Some of them are pretty cool. Oh,
[2273.05s -> 2275.05s]  quick recommendation while we're here.
[2275.05s -> 2277.05s]  I'd recommend getting some provisions
[2277.05s -> 2279.05s]  for your horse so they can eat and not die.
[2279.05s -> 2281.29s]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[2281.29s -> 2283.29s]  Yeah, and maybe a horse reviver too.
[2283.29s -> 2286.60s]  A little expensive, but it's probably
[2286.60s -> 2290.63s]  worth it. So it's services, right?
[2290.63s -> 2292.63s]  Well, not services. Under
[2292.63s -> 2295.77s]  provisions. How much is it? Yeah.
[2295.77s -> 2297.77s]  That's a lot of money. Well, the horse reviver's a lot
[2297.77s -> 2299.77s]  of money, but the hay is a quarter,
[2299.77s -> 2302.90s]  so that's not too bad, and it's... I'm just gonna buy
[2302.90s -> 2305.08s]  shit right now. Hey, what about a sugar
[2305.08s -> 2307.77s]  cube? You gonna get a couple of those? I'm gonna
[2307.77s -> 2309.77s]  get some beets from Shroot Farms, but
[2309.77s -> 2311.77s]  yeah, I'm gonna get some sugar cube. I got a horse
[2311.77s -> 2315.86s]  reviver, I got some food. You know, by doing this,
[2315.86s -> 2317.86s]  we're never gonna afford new weapons.
[2317.86s -> 2320.98s]  Never. I've come to
[2320.98s -> 2323.48s]  terms with the fact that it's just gonna be
[2323.48s -> 2325.98s]  I'm gonna use the pea shooter with the BB gun.
[2325.98s -> 2328.41s]  Yeah. Me too.
[2328.41s -> 2332.38s]  Should we get our horses? Sorry, I had some
[2332.38s -> 2334.62s]  peanut butter. Like a horse would.
[2334.62s -> 2336.98s]  That's what they used to feed Mr.
[2336.98s -> 2338.98s]  Ed to make it look like he was talking.
[2338.98s -> 2341.86s]  The way you said
[2341.86s -> 2343.86s]  that too, like the way your voice managed to squeak
[2343.86s -> 2345.86s]  out that sentence, it sounded like Mr. Ed a little bit
[2345.86s -> 2347.86s]  gush-poo-poo.
[2347.86s -> 2352.54s]  So, good job.
[2352.54s -> 2355.54s]  I didn't even... That show sucks!
[2355.54s -> 2358.36s]  Yeah, I hated Mr. Ed.
[2358.36s -> 2360.86s]  That horse scared the fuck out of me.
[2360.86s -> 2364.38s]  Why does it talk? I don't like it.
[2364.38s -> 2368.09s]  Why didn't anybody try to breed it?
[2368.09s -> 2370.09s]  You could have a bunch of... You could start an entire
[2370.09s -> 2372.09s]  new horse...
[2372.09s -> 2374.52s]  Sub-species. Yeah.
[2374.52s -> 2376.52s]  We could have intelligent horses
[2376.52s -> 2378.82s]  all talking. Sell them.
[2378.82s -> 2381.26s]  They would be so happy. We could...
[2381.26s -> 2383.26s]  Horses that just love to sit around and eat hay, right?
[2383.26s -> 2385.43s]  Yeah. That's all they do.
[2385.43s -> 2387.43s]  Just put a headset on, yeah.
[2387.43s -> 2389.80s]  Put a headset on them and they could be like
[2389.80s -> 2393.32s]  telemarketers while they're just hanging out.
[2393.32s -> 2395.32s]  Where are we going? That's right!
[2395.32s -> 2397.56s]  You give them jobs again. Like, because they don't have
[2397.56s -> 2399.56s]  as many jobs these days like they used to back in the
[2399.56s -> 2401.56s]  old west and, you know, before that, of course.
[2401.56s -> 2403.56s]  But I think, yeah, make them telemarketers.
[2403.56s -> 2405.56s]  Hello! How can I help you?
[2405.56s -> 2407.93s]  They would be so happy.
[2407.93s -> 2409.93s]  They would get paid. They would get paid.
[2409.93s -> 2412.68s]  Of course we would pay them. Of course.
[2412.68s -> 2414.68s]  Fucking horse cars. Of course.
[2414.68s -> 2418.06s]  Where are we going? I don't know.
[2418.06s -> 2420.06s]  Do you want to kill some things?
[2420.06s -> 2422.42s]  Yeah, let's go...
[2422.42s -> 2424.42s]  In the context of this video game, yes.
[2424.42s -> 2427.05s]  It's out of context.
[2427.05s -> 2429.29s]  Hey, you want to go kill some stuff? Yeah!
[2429.29s -> 2432.42s]  Yeah, we don't want to do that.
[2432.42s -> 2434.42s]  I want to go run over some rabbits.
[2434.42s -> 2439.80s]  I can start up a quick join
[2439.80s -> 2442.10s]  and we can do a mission.
[2442.10s -> 2444.10s]  We can do a story mission or we can do like a
[2444.10s -> 2446.79s]  showdown mission.
[2446.79s -> 2448.79s]  Let's do a showdown mission.
[2448.79s -> 2454.04s]  Why not?
[2454.04s -> 2456.04s]  Showdown series. You'll also join as a member of their posse.
[2456.04s -> 2471.83s]  Okay, cool. It looks like we're going.
[2471.83s -> 2473.83s]  So how's the weather over there, man?
[2473.83s -> 2476.33s]  It's beautiful. Do you miss Boston weather?
[2476.33s -> 2479.34s]  Not at all.
[2479.34s -> 2481.34s]  This is snow season here
[2481.34s -> 2483.34s]  for Boston, so
[2483.34s -> 2485.34s]  I am absolutely ecstatic that
[2485.34s -> 2487.34s]  it's like 50 degrees
[2487.34s -> 2489.34s]  every day. It drops down overnight
[2489.34s -> 2491.34s]  because it's obviously the desert, so it drops down to like
[2491.34s -> 2493.34s]  low 40s.
[2493.34s -> 2495.34s]  So it gets cold, but
[2495.34s -> 2497.34s]  the days are great.
[2497.34s -> 2500.79s]  He's literally talking about
[2500.79s -> 2502.79s]  the weather.
[2502.79s -> 2504.79s]  Oh god, I just got booted.
[2504.79s -> 2506.79s]  Wait, you got booted?
[2506.79s -> 2508.79s]  Really? Yeah.
[2508.79s -> 2510.79s]  Oh, okay. Why does this game
[2510.79s -> 2512.79s]  hate me so much?
[2512.79s -> 2516.06s]  I'll just quit out.
[2516.06s -> 2518.06s]  I don't know why this game hates me so much.
[2518.06s -> 2523.24s]  What's wrong with the weather?
[2523.24s -> 2525.24s]  I'll just say this. Lately it's been pretty cold
[2525.24s -> 2528.76s]  here, but
[2528.76s -> 2531.06s]  considered at times in my life
[2531.06s -> 2533.06s]  moving to a place where I don't
[2533.06s -> 2535.06s]  have to deal with like
[2535.06s -> 2537.69s]  bone chill.
[2537.69s -> 2539.69s]  The one thing that I will say
[2539.69s -> 2541.69s]  is going to the west coast
[2541.69s -> 2544.49s]  is, I mean
[2544.49s -> 2546.49s]  there are pros and cons everywhere. I mean I miss Boston
[2546.49s -> 2548.49s]  all the time. Yeah.
[2548.49s -> 2550.49s]  But you miss bagels. Yeah.
[2550.49s -> 2552.49s]  You bet your ass I do.
[2552.49s -> 2555.56s]  I miss the bagels. I miss the
[2555.56s -> 2557.56s]  sub sandwiches, like the steak and cheese subs.
[2557.56s -> 2559.99s]  I miss those.
[2559.99s -> 2562.36s]  Yeah. I would miss those too.
[2562.36s -> 2565.05s]  I miss the pizza. Ah, that's
[2565.05s -> 2567.05s]  right. Do you find any good pizza?
[2567.05s -> 2569.22s]  Yeah, I mean there's some decent pizza places
[2569.22s -> 2571.22s]  out here, but not like there are in New York
[2571.22s -> 2575.83s]  obviously. Okay, I'm
[2575.83s -> 2577.83s]  going to try to invite you again. Yeah,
[2577.83s -> 2579.83s]  I don't know why
[2579.83s -> 2581.83s]  because
[2581.83s -> 2583.83s]  every time it kicks me out it says, there's a problem
[2583.83s -> 2585.83s]  with the Rockstar servers. It doesn't
[2585.83s -> 2587.83s]  like say, you've been disconnected because your computer
[2587.83s -> 2589.83s]  sucks. It's, you've been
[2589.83s -> 2591.83s]  disconnected but our servers are a problem.
[2591.83s -> 2593.83s]  That's like what the error code is. At least
[2593.83s -> 2597.10s]  they're honest about it. I don't know
[2597.10s -> 2599.10s]  though, I feel like, I don't
[2599.10s -> 2601.10s]  know who this is. Who the fuck is this?
[2601.10s -> 2607.37s]  I think I just,
[2607.37s -> 2611.85s]  all right. All right.
[2611.85s -> 2616.20s]  I'm ready for an invite.
[2616.20s -> 2618.20s]  Here it is. Hey, coming
[2618.20s -> 2620.20s]  to you. Hey.
[2620.20s -> 2623.53s]  Hey.
[2628.33s -> 2630.33s]  I've been watching The Office like
[2630.33s -> 2632.33s]  a dumbass lately. I don't know why. It's a good show.
[2632.33s -> 2634.33s]  There's an episode.
[2634.33s -> 2636.33s]  It's a good show. I don't know. It's just it was something to watch
[2636.33s -> 2638.33s]  and there's an episode where in the beginning
[2638.33s -> 2640.33s]  it was cold open.
[2640.33s -> 2642.33s]  We talked about the weather and now I'm talking about
[2642.33s -> 2644.33s]  I'm describing episodes of The Office.
[2644.33s -> 2646.33s]  Your audience is going to be like, can you stop
[2646.33s -> 2648.33s]  streaming with this guy?
[2648.33s -> 2650.33s]  This guy sucks. He can't even
[2650.33s -> 2652.33s]  stay connected to Rockstar's video game
[2652.33s -> 2654.33s]  servers and he's talking about the weather.
[2654.33s -> 2658.04s]  Anyway, there's an episode
[2658.04s -> 2660.04s]  where they go A and I'm going to stop
[2660.04s -> 2662.04s]  there. It's good enough.
[2662.04s -> 2664.04s]  There's an episode where they go A.
[2664.04s -> 2666.04s]  Yeah, they go A.
[2666.04s -> 2668.28s]  Here, I'll invite you again.
[2668.28s -> 2670.28s]  We have another problem at this point.
[2670.28s -> 2672.28s]  I'll just like watch you stream.
[2672.28s -> 2674.28s]  No, I mean, I'm down to
[2674.28s -> 2676.28s]  try a couple more matches at least.
[2676.28s -> 2678.28s]  It's worth a shot.
[2678.28s -> 2680.28s]  I think we could have some fun if it
[2680.28s -> 2682.28s]  just was stable. I know, I know. I don't understand.
[2682.28s -> 2684.28s]  I've gotten
[2684.28s -> 2686.28s]  disconnected like three or four times when I stream this too.
[2686.28s -> 2688.28s]  But it happens.
[2688.28s -> 2690.28s]  Usually from random matches.
[2690.28s -> 2693.02s]  I don't understand.
[2693.02s -> 2695.02s]  What's the weather like on The Office?
[2695.02s -> 2697.02s]  What's the weather like?
[2697.02s -> 2699.02s]  Well,
[2699.02s -> 2701.02s]  there's an episode where they go A.
[2701.02s -> 2703.83s]  I can answer that
[2703.83s -> 2705.83s]  because it was filmed in
[2705.83s -> 2707.83s]  California and they try to make it look
[2707.83s -> 2709.83s]  like Scranton, Pennsylvania, so it's snowy.
[2709.83s -> 2711.83s]  But it's really not.
[2715.72s -> 2717.72s]  Well,
[2717.72s -> 2721.56s]  I got booted again.
[2721.56s -> 2723.56s]  Super cool.
[2723.56s -> 2725.56s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. But you're still
[2725.56s -> 2727.56s]  like, you haven't had any problems streaming.
[2727.56s -> 2729.56s]  Oh, no, not at all. I've got no drop frames at all.
[2729.56s -> 2732.57s]  It's something
[2732.57s -> 2734.57s]  to do with where I'm coming from.
[2734.57s -> 2736.87s]  Why does Rockstar not want to
[2736.87s -> 2738.87s]  acknowledge Las Vegas?
[2738.87s -> 2740.87s]  Maybe they don't. I don't understand.
[2740.87s -> 2742.87s]  No, I'm not deleting the game.
[2745.62s -> 2747.62s]  Yeah, I don't know. It's something to do with
[2747.62s -> 2749.80s]  how they connect. I figured
[2749.80s -> 2751.80s]  it was a problem from three days ago because it was the
[2751.80s -> 2753.80s]  first day or two of the beta, but
[2753.80s -> 2755.80s]  it looks like it's kind of just a server routing
[2755.80s -> 2757.80s]  or server problem
[2757.80s -> 2759.80s]  with Rockstar. And
[2759.80s -> 2762.23s]  specifically either Las Vegas
[2762.23s -> 2764.60s]  servers or
[2764.60s -> 2766.60s]  California servers because, I mean, technically
[2766.60s -> 2769.93s]  I'm on the West Coast.
[2769.93s -> 2771.93s]  Well, maybe they'll get that sorted out in a couple days.
[2771.93s -> 2773.93s]  That's what I was hoping for
[2773.93s -> 2775.93s]  three days ago.
[2775.93s -> 2777.93s]  Yeah, sorry. Sorry this is kind of
[2777.93s -> 2779.93s]  impeding on everything.
[2779.93s -> 2781.93s]  That's fine. I mean, I'm still shooting people in the
[2781.93s -> 2783.93s]  face. It's not a big deal. But I would prefer
[2783.93s -> 2785.93s]  to shoot people in the face with you in an
[2785.93s -> 2788.68s]  actual match. That would be better.
[2788.68s -> 2790.68s]  I'll invite you again.
[2790.68s -> 2794.01s]  Let's try again. Yeah, let's try again.
[2794.01s -> 2798.17s]  Even though it says I'm on a mission.
[2798.17s -> 2800.17s]  Maybe they just hate you.
[2800.17s -> 2803.69s]  I don't know, maybe. I tried restarting
[2803.69s -> 2809.32s]  it. Moving to the country,
[2809.32s -> 2811.32s]  gonna eat myself some
[2811.32s -> 2813.32s]  peaches. Moving
[2813.32s -> 2815.32s]  to the country, gonna eat
[2815.32s -> 2817.32s]  me a lot of peaches.
[2817.32s -> 2819.32s]  Look out!
[2819.32s -> 2821.32s]  Look out, man!
[2821.32s -> 2824.20s]  Peaches come
[2824.20s -> 2826.20s]  in a can. They was put
[2826.20s -> 2828.20s]  there by a man.
[2830.70s -> 2832.70s]  I haven't heard that in a long time. Holy shit.
[2832.70s -> 2834.70s]  Yeah, that was
[2834.70s -> 2836.70s]  for you. I figured you might know about that. That was
[2836.70s -> 2838.94s]  great. Yeah.
[2838.94s -> 2840.94s]  I feel like, I feel really good
[2840.94s -> 2842.94s]  right now. I was a little sad
[2842.94s -> 2844.94s]  about like the Rockstar server issue here, but
[2844.94s -> 2846.94s]  I feel fantastic.
[2846.94s -> 2848.94s]  Yeah, that just takes
[2848.94s -> 2850.94s]  the power of song. That's all it takes.
[2850.94s -> 2853.99s]  Alright, here we go.
[2853.99s -> 2856.23s]  Don't do it, Rockstar. I know
[2856.23s -> 2858.23s]  you want to. Look at them.
[2858.23s -> 2860.23s]  Look at them do it. Look at how much they want.
[2860.23s -> 2862.23s]  Okay. I'm ready
[2862.23s -> 2864.60s]  for an invite.
[2864.60s -> 2866.60s]  And this will be the last time because it's going to stay
[2866.60s -> 2868.60s]  on. I'm not going to get disconnected from
[2868.60s -> 2871.03s]  Rockstar servers. The problem is
[2871.03s -> 2873.03s]  I can't actually invite you now because I'm in a mission.
[2873.03s -> 2875.03s]  Supposedly. Maybe for the better
[2875.03s -> 2877.03s]  so I can stay connected for a minute.
[2877.03s -> 2884.01s]  That's what you think. I know.
[2884.01s -> 2887.59s]  Let me try...
[2887.59s -> 2889.59s]  Explain to me what
[2889.59s -> 2891.59s]  you were just doing. Because
[2891.59s -> 2893.59s]  you were doing like a randomized Ocarina
[2893.59s -> 2896.54s]  of Time? Yeah.
[2896.54s -> 2898.54s]  So there's a randomizer
[2898.54s -> 2900.54s]  and you can assign a bunch of different
[2900.54s -> 2902.54s]  options. It's a really customizable randomizer.
[2902.54s -> 2904.54s]  And
[2904.54s -> 2906.54s]  all you have to do is
[2906.54s -> 2908.54s]  every chest...
[2908.54s -> 2910.54s]  Wow, I did what you did earlier.
[2910.54s -> 2912.54s]  Every treasure chest.
[2912.54s -> 2914.54s]  Oh, Jesus.
[2914.54s -> 2916.54s]  Good luck saying it the right way ever again.
[2916.54s -> 2918.54s]  Every treasure chest
[2918.54s -> 2920.54s]  has randomized content
[2920.54s -> 2922.54s]  except for a couple. And
[2922.54s -> 2924.54s]  you can find medallions, you can find items,
[2924.54s -> 2926.54s]  you can find swords, you can find all kinds of crazy shit.
[2926.54s -> 2928.54s]  Really? And essentially
[2928.54s -> 2930.54s]  you have to get the six medallions
[2930.54s -> 2932.54s]  and they could be anywhere. And then you can fight
[2932.54s -> 2934.54s]  Ganon. And you can
[2934.54s -> 2936.54s]  make it really hard for yourself
[2936.54s -> 2938.54s]  or you can make it a lot easier for yourself.
[2938.54s -> 2940.54s]  Like, for example, I started the game
[2940.54s -> 2942.54s]  Kakariko Village was open.
[2942.54s -> 2944.54s]  I started the game where
[2944.54s -> 2946.54s]  Kokiri Forest was open so I could just leave
[2946.54s -> 2948.54s]  and go to the world map anytime. Oh, really?
[2948.54s -> 2950.54s]  So, but yeah,
[2950.54s -> 2952.54s]  I mean, it's kind of cool because you could just play the game
[2952.54s -> 2954.54s]  in like six or seven hours
[2954.54s -> 2956.54s]  if you're lucky and you know what you're doing.
[2956.54s -> 2958.54s]  So could you get everything in the first six
[2958.54s -> 2960.54s]  chests of the game?
[2960.54s -> 2962.54s]  I got a hookshot in the first chest.
[2962.54s -> 2964.54s]  Wow. That's cool.
[2964.54s -> 2966.54s]  And you can get some, I got a
[2966.54s -> 2968.54s]  medallion real early. You can get really broken
[2968.54s -> 2970.54s]  like stuff early on
[2970.54s -> 2972.54s]  or you can get five blue rupees.
[2972.54s -> 2974.54s]  Five rupees every time.
[2974.54s -> 2976.54s]  Which is the worst thing ever.
[2976.54s -> 2978.54s]  Yeah, that's like
[2978.54s -> 2980.54s]  what is it, green rupee the lowest?
[2980.54s -> 2983.93s]  Mhm.
[2983.93s -> 2985.93s]  But it's a really fun thing.
[2985.93s -> 2987.93s]  I love it. I'm really enjoying it.
[2987.93s -> 2990.74s]  No, it seemed cool. It seemed really cool
[2990.74s -> 2993.11s]  from what I saw.
[2993.11s -> 2995.11s]  You've never done a randomizer stream?
[2995.11s -> 2997.11s]  Never. I mean, the only randomizer
[2997.11s -> 2999.11s]  I've ever heard of or ever done was something like
[2999.11s -> 3004.49s]  Team Fortress
[3004.49s -> 3006.49s]  and that just randomizes loadouts, not like
[3006.49s -> 3008.49s]  randomizing the whole game essentially. Oh, I see.
[3008.49s -> 3011.11s]  I gotcha. So I'm just
[3011.11s -> 3013.11s]  kind of, I'm just running until my character
[3013.11s -> 3015.54s]  dies.
[3015.54s -> 3017.54s]  Is that possible?
[3017.54s -> 3019.54s]  You need to feed the character eventually.
[3019.54s -> 3021.54s]  Hey chat, does anyone know how to
[3021.54s -> 3023.54s]  abandon this stupid mailbag quest?
[3023.54s -> 3025.54s]  Oh yeah, I got stuck in
[3025.54s -> 3027.91s]  the mail room by the way. You gotta be
[3027.91s -> 3036.87s]  careful with that mail door.
[3036.87s -> 3038.87s]  Shoot yourself in the head. Okay, now
[3038.87s -> 3040.87s]  the timer ran out. Okay, so now I can probably
[3040.87s -> 3045.86s]  invite you.
[3045.86s -> 3048.62s]  Yes, the mail door.
[3048.62s -> 3050.62s]  The door to the mail room. The mail door.
[3050.62s -> 3052.62s]  I got trapped in there. Remember when I was
[3052.62s -> 3056.20s]  breaking windows? Did someone not
[3056.20s -> 3058.20s]  understand? They were like, what are you talking about, Jerma?
[3058.20s -> 3060.20s]  They were saying like M-A-L-E, like
[3060.20s -> 3062.20s]  mail door. Oh.
[3062.20s -> 3073.13s]  Okay.
[3073.13s -> 3075.56s]  You alright? You okay?
[3075.56s -> 3077.99s]  What happened?
[3077.99s -> 3079.99s]  Tell me in minute detail.
[3079.99s -> 3081.99s]  I got shot in the head.
[3081.99s -> 3083.99s]  Hey, can you invite me?
[3083.99s -> 3085.99s]  I see.
[3085.99s -> 3087.99s]  Because my invite thing is totally
[3087.99s -> 3089.99s]  blocked out for some reason.
[3089.99s -> 3093.56s]  Mine is too.
[3093.56s -> 3095.56s]  You invites and updates.
[3095.56s -> 3098.25s]  Can I?
[3098.25s -> 3101.70s]  Yeah, I can't invite you either.
[3101.70s -> 3105.67s]  It's blocked out.
[3105.67s -> 3107.67s]  Rockstar, what the heck are you doing here?
[3107.67s -> 3115.29s]  I guess I'll just die.
[3115.29s -> 3117.29s]  Are we in the same game?
[3117.29s -> 3120.17s]  I'm playing Red Dead Redemption 3.
[3120.17s -> 3122.54s]  Well, because
[3122.54s -> 3124.54s]  if we're in the same lobby,
[3124.54s -> 3127.16s]  I don't think so.
[3127.16s -> 3129.16s]  No, because I can't. No, I don't think so either.
[3129.16s -> 3131.16s]  Because I can't even get you into my posse.
[3131.16s -> 3135.13s]  R1 on the player list.
[3135.13s -> 3139.16s]  Apparently
[3139.16s -> 3144.28s]  you're not even online.
[3144.28s -> 3146.28s]  Yeah, apparently.
[3146.28s -> 3148.28s]  Go to your friends tabs or go to players and hit R1.
[3148.28s -> 3150.46s]  And does it say I'm like
[3150.46s -> 3159.59s]  online?
[3159.59s -> 3165.42s]  I'm just eating baked beans.
[3165.42s -> 3167.42s]  You know what's a cool thing to do as a streamer I found out
[3167.42s -> 3169.42s]  I've learned over the years?
[3169.42s -> 3171.42s]  Eat food while you're streaming.
[3171.42s -> 3173.42s]  I can't
[3173.42s -> 3175.42s]  do that, man.
[3175.42s -> 3177.42s]  It's either the best thing for some
[3177.42s -> 3179.42s]  people and they love it.
[3179.42s -> 3181.42s]  Or it's like they'll watch
[3181.42s -> 3183.42s]  the stream specifically because it's social eating.
[3183.42s -> 3185.42s]  Yeah, I've heard of that.
[3185.42s -> 3187.42s]  They hate the way it sounds, yeah.
[3187.42s -> 3189.42s]  I've heard of like the social eating thing, but not just like
[3189.42s -> 3191.42s]  oh, hey guys, just gonna take a break from Red Dead
[3191.42s -> 3193.42s]  and eat a plate of spaghetti. Hold on.
[3193.42s -> 3195.42s]  I couldn't do it. I don't want people
[3195.42s -> 3197.42s]  to look at me when I'm eating.
[3197.42s -> 3199.42s]  Yeah, don't fucking look at me is what I say.
[3199.42s -> 3201.42s]  I don't?
[3201.42s -> 3203.42s]  When I go to dinner, out with friends
[3203.42s -> 3205.42s]  or family and the food comes out,
[3205.42s -> 3207.42s]  I hate the fact that everyone's just
[3207.42s -> 3209.42s]  able to look at me just across the table.
[3209.42s -> 3211.42s]  Fuck, you know what?
[3211.42s -> 3213.42s]  Let's go off on this. Fuck the whole table
[3213.42s -> 3215.42s]  scenario that we have here in the United States.
[3215.42s -> 3217.42s]  Somebody's sitting across from you.
[3217.42s -> 3219.42s]  They're always looking at you and they're staring at your eyes
[3219.42s -> 3221.42s]  like you do the weird eye contact when you both take a huge
[3221.42s -> 3223.42s]  bite and you're like, oh, whoops.
[3223.42s -> 3225.42s]  Just line us up on the
[3225.42s -> 3227.42s]  other side so it's just a giant bench
[3227.42s -> 3229.42s]  and no one's across
[3229.42s -> 3231.42s]  from you. Everyone just sits and you can fit so many
[3231.42s -> 3234.62s]  more people. Like Thanksgiving, except
[3234.62s -> 3236.62s]  for the fact that you don't have to sit across from anybody.
[3236.62s -> 3239.37s]  That's like the Last Supper you mean, right?
[3239.37s -> 3241.37s]  What the fuck are you doing here?
[3241.37s -> 3243.37s]  How did you get in here? How did you get in here?
[3243.37s -> 3247.59s]  No, no, no. Get off me.
[3247.59s -> 3250.28s]  Get off me.
[3250.28s -> 3254.31s]  Get your hands in the air. How did you find me?
[3254.31s -> 3257.00s]  I don't even understand how
[3257.00s -> 3260.84s]  you got in here.
[3260.84s -> 3264.68s]  I went into
[3264.68s -> 3266.68s]  the menus and I found you.
[3266.68s -> 3269.62s]  Easy, easy.
[3269.62s -> 3272.50s]  Watch the edge.
[3272.50s -> 3274.50s]  Oh my god, you're choking me to death.
[3274.50s -> 3276.50s]  Oh shit, I didn't mean to do that.
[3276.50s -> 3279.45s]  Oh, that's a shame.
[3279.45s -> 3281.45s]  No, stay right there.
[3281.45s -> 3283.45s]  I want to take a picture of you.
[3283.45s -> 3287.42s]  I want to get like a good photo of you.
[3287.42s -> 3294.97s]  By the way, I'm the camera.
[3294.97s -> 3297.46s]  Okay.
[3297.46s -> 3305.21s]  I lived. I somehow lived.
[3305.21s -> 3307.21s]  Oh, look who I've got.
[3307.21s -> 3310.66s]  Hey, come on down here.
[3310.66s -> 3312.66s]  Come retrieve your body. Who's this?
[3312.66s -> 3314.66s]  Oh, that's me. Was that me?
[3314.66s -> 3316.66s]  Yeah, I threw you down there.
[3316.66s -> 3318.66s]  What the fuck? Hold on a minute.
[3318.66s -> 3321.54s]  I know what we're going to do today.
[3321.54s -> 3325.56s]  Okay, we're going to make
[3325.56s -> 3327.56s]  a bunch of dead bodies of ourselves
[3327.56s -> 3329.80s]  on this ledge.
[3329.80s -> 3331.80s]  It really will be Westworld then.
[3331.80s -> 3333.80s]  I just invited you to a posse though.
[3333.80s -> 3335.80s]  Oh, did you?
[3335.80s -> 3337.80s]  I don't see any invites.
[3337.80s -> 3339.80s]  I think I just kicked the muskrat.
[3339.80s -> 3342.04s]  How come I don't have any invites from you?
[3342.04s -> 3344.66s]  Because this fucking
[3344.66s -> 3346.66s]  service is so fucking broken.
[3348.66s -> 3358.39s]  I'm gone.
[3358.39s -> 3360.39s]  Here's the wild thing.
[3360.39s -> 3362.39s]  This is worse than before. This is worse than it was
[3362.39s -> 3365.14s]  three days ago.
[3365.14s -> 3367.14s]  Did you get disconnected again?
[3367.14s -> 3370.60s]  Yeah, this is worse than it was three days ago.
[3370.60s -> 3378.26s]  Damn.
[3378.26s -> 3380.26s]  There's something wrong with
[3380.26s -> 3382.26s]  what Rockstar servers on the East Coast,
[3382.26s -> 3384.26s]  West Coast specifically, has to be.
[3384.26s -> 3386.82s]  I'm sure it's something.
[3386.82s -> 3388.82s]  Because I have a
[3388.82s -> 3390.82s]  stable connection everywhere.
[3396.78s -> 3398.95s]  Okay, this is weird.
[3398.95s -> 3400.95s]  I'm lagging too because my character is doing the
[3400.95s -> 3402.95s]  whistling face, but there are no whistles coming out of it.
[3408.58s -> 3410.58s]  He says he doesn't eat on stream, but
[3410.58s -> 3412.58s]  there was a time you shoved a bunch of taquitos
[3412.58s -> 3414.58s]  into your mouth or something.
[3414.58s -> 3419.77s]  The character is going
[3419.77s -> 3422.58s]  meme-y.
[3422.58s -> 3424.58s]  I'm all lagged out.
[3424.58s -> 3426.58s]  Did you eat like taquitos
[3426.58s -> 3428.58s]  on stream?
[3428.58s -> 3430.58s]  They said you don't
[3430.58s -> 3432.58s]  eat on stream, but you ate a
[3432.58s -> 3434.58s]  shitload of taquitos when you were shitfaced or something.
[3434.58s -> 3437.59s]  What?
[3437.59s -> 3439.59s]  Oh, they're talking about
[3439.59s -> 3441.59s]  me.
[3441.59s -> 3447.42s]  Oh, me.
[3447.42s -> 3449.42s]  You don't remember this.
[3449.42s -> 3451.42s]  I guess you were shitfaced.
[3451.42s -> 3453.42s]  When did I eat taquitos?
[3453.42s -> 3459.24s]  What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[3459.24s -> 3461.24s]  I ate testiculitos.
[3461.24s -> 3463.24s]  Vdub gave me some.
[3463.24s -> 3465.24s]  What?
[3465.24s -> 3467.54s]  What the fuck?
[3467.54s -> 3469.54s]  I have a rival as a pro Call of Duty player
[3469.54s -> 3471.54s]  named Vdub.
[3471.54s -> 3473.54s]  He's got a thing called testiculitos.
[3473.54s -> 3475.54s]  It's a long story.
[3475.54s -> 3477.54s]  Testiculitos.
[3477.54s -> 3479.54s]  Okay, is your invite
[3479.54s -> 3481.85s]  grayed out?
[3481.85s -> 3483.85s]  Oh yeah, yes it is.
[3483.85s -> 3485.85s]  So, I don't know, maybe there's just a problem again
[3485.85s -> 3487.85s]  and we picked the great, perfect day
[3487.85s -> 3489.85s]  three days later where it just doesn't work
[3489.85s -> 3492.66s]  again.
[3492.66s -> 3494.66s]  I mean, I know how I joined your game before.
[3494.66s -> 3496.66s]  I went into the friends menu, I went to your profile
[3496.66s -> 3498.66s]  and then I clicked join, so I'm going to do that again
[3498.66s -> 3500.66s]  and see if that works.
[3500.66s -> 3502.66s]  Yeah, I don't understand, man. I wish I knew.
[3509.75s -> 3512.38s]  Oh, there's tobacco here.
[3512.38s -> 3516.66s]  I was wasted and
[3516.66s -> 3518.66s]  Kim brought me
[3518.66s -> 3522.12s]  taquitos.
[3522.12s -> 3525.06s]  That didn't happen. I've never had a taquito before
[3525.06s -> 3532.68s]  in my life.
[3532.68s -> 3534.68s]  What did you just crack open?
[3534.68s -> 3537.11s]  Is it like a coarse light?
[3537.11s -> 3539.11s]  No, it was gum, dude.
[3539.11s -> 3541.11s]  I got disconnected again.
[3541.11s -> 3543.61s]  Is there something else we can do?
[3543.61s -> 3545.61s]  I feel like I've like torn
[3545.61s -> 3547.61s]  you away from what you were doing and it's like,
[3547.61s -> 3549.61s]  hey, it's been an hour and everything's just shot.
[3549.61s -> 3551.61s]  This was the plan from the beginning.
[3551.61s -> 3553.61s]  This is not at all
[3553.61s -> 3555.61s]  disrupting me or my streaming.
[3555.61s -> 3558.81s]  Well, I mean, I kind of have to go soon anyway,
[3558.81s -> 3560.81s]  so this isn't really that big of a deal. It's just a shame
[3560.81s -> 3562.81s]  that this doesn't work because I was having fun.
[3562.81s -> 3564.81s]  Yeah, I really want to play it.
[3569.16s -> 3571.16s]  Just watch you play. We're going to
[3571.16s -> 3573.16s]  live vicariously through you.
[3573.16s -> 3575.16s]  Yeah, but even if you do watch me play, I'm going to get
[3575.16s -> 3577.16s]  disconnected too. I've been getting disconnected.
[3577.16s -> 3579.85s]  Alert, you have been disconnected
[3579.85s -> 3581.85s]  from Red Dead Online due to a fault on
[3581.85s -> 3583.85s]  Rockstar Game Services.
[3583.85s -> 3588.50s]  When is the beta supposed to be done?
[3588.50s -> 3594.31s]  A year.
[3594.31s -> 3599.54s]  Alert. Hey, did you
[3599.54s -> 3602.17s]  get the alert? I got an alert.
[3602.17s -> 3604.86s]  Yep. I got it on my cell phone.
[3604.86s -> 3607.48s]  Hey, please ping me.
[3607.48s -> 3609.48s]  Please send me a text every time that
[3609.48s -> 3612.36s]  the servers go down. By the way,
[3612.36s -> 3614.36s]  I think Kraken was playing this not too long ago,
[3614.36s -> 3616.36s]  so maybe we can get the old crew
[3616.36s -> 3618.36s]  back together. Yeah, I'd
[3618.36s -> 3620.36s]  love to actually play this because what's here would
[3620.36s -> 3623.37s]  be fun. Yeah.
[3623.37s -> 3625.37s]  Maybe not, you know, when the game
[3625.37s -> 3627.37s]  is still broken, but when it's fixed,
[3627.37s -> 3629.37s]  we can
[3629.37s -> 3631.86s]  bug Kraken. Yeah, how many people
[3631.86s -> 3633.86s]  can you have in like a squad?
[3633.86s -> 3636.10s]  I think four.
[3636.10s -> 3638.10s]  Four for a non-paid posse.
[3638.10s -> 3640.10s]  You have to pay,
[3640.10s -> 3642.47s]  you have to actually pay for it
[3642.47s -> 3645.48s]  with like in-game money.
[3645.48s -> 3647.48s]  That's kind of weird. That's cool.
[3647.48s -> 3649.48s]  Yeah. What about
[3649.48s -> 3651.48s]  Critical? Critical is like, he's a bigger
[3651.48s -> 3653.48s]  YouTuber slash street, like
[3653.48s -> 3655.48s]  I guess more YouTuber, but he's like such a big
[3655.48s -> 3657.48s]  YouTuber. I always feel bad bothering him. I don't know.
[3657.48s -> 3660.15s]  It's hard to explain.
[3660.15s -> 3662.15s]  I would like to get Critical involved.
[3662.15s -> 3664.15s]  He's not a very proactive person
[3664.15s -> 3666.15s]  when it comes to stuff like this.
[3666.15s -> 3668.71s]  He threw
[3668.71s -> 3670.71s]  cards at me the other day, and
[3670.71s -> 3672.71s]  I was screaming at him and stuff. So yeah,
[3672.71s -> 3674.71s]  maybe he'll play. You think he would be
[3674.71s -> 3676.71s]  down? Maybe, yeah.
[3676.71s -> 3678.71s]  I'll give him a shout. I was going to talk to him anyways.
[3678.71s -> 3680.71s]  So how
[3680.71s -> 3682.71s]  about we make a plan without
[3682.71s -> 3684.71s]  people expecting it to be
[3684.71s -> 3686.71s]  like Word of God, that it's going
[3686.71s -> 3688.71s]  to happen 100%. But when this
[3688.71s -> 3690.71s]  game gets fixed, and when
[3690.71s -> 3692.71s]  we can play with a stable connection,
[3692.71s -> 3694.71s]  me, you, Criken,
[3694.71s -> 3696.71s]  Critical will try to get like a thing going.
[3696.71s -> 3699.14s]  Oh, sick! That sounds
[3699.14s -> 3701.70s]  good. Cool.
[3701.70s -> 3703.70s]  So,
[3703.70s -> 3705.70s]  I think,
[3705.70s -> 3707.70s]  I don't know what your plan is. Are you going to just
[3707.70s -> 3710.52s]  take off? What, tonight?
[3710.52s -> 3712.52s]  Like right now. Like
[3712.52s -> 3714.52s]  right now? I'm going to invite you one more time because
[3714.52s -> 3716.52s]  I think the server's restarted. Oh, the server's
[3716.52s -> 3718.52s]  restarted? Yeah, maybe.
[3718.52s -> 3724.09s]  Okay. Somebody said,
[3724.09s -> 3726.09s]  oh no, it's the end of the stream voice.
[3728.09s -> 3730.09s]  Mine? No, I like mine.
[3730.09s -> 3732.09s]  Like, all right, do you do a thing when you
[3732.09s -> 3734.09s]  stream, when like, okay, let's say you've been streaming for
[3734.09s -> 3736.09s]  you know, six, seven, four,
[3736.09s -> 3738.09s]  whatever, five. You're getting a little tired.
[3738.09s -> 3740.39s]  Do you do like a, okay,
[3740.39s -> 3742.39s]  so, do you do like a, I'm going to
[3742.39s -> 3744.39s]  end the stream voice? Yep.
[3744.39s -> 3746.39s]  Yeah. I think so.
[3746.39s -> 3752.34s]  I didn't just do it right there.
[3752.34s -> 3754.34s]  Are you in game? I'm loading in
[3754.34s -> 3756.34s]  right now. Okay, when, okay, let me know
[3756.34s -> 3758.34s]  when you, when you load it in because it says
[3758.34s -> 3760.34s]  it wants me to invite, um,
[3760.34s -> 3763.29s]  it wants to invite me to watch
[3763.29s -> 3765.59s]  your stream. It wants to invite
[3765.59s -> 3767.59s]  you to watch my stream? To watch your
[3767.59s -> 3769.59s]  gameplay, yes. Oh, you're going to come watch
[3769.59s -> 3771.59s]  my gameplay? That's what it wants, yeah.
[3771.59s -> 3774.28s]  Share play? Yeah,
[3774.28s -> 3776.28s]  it's the end of the phone call voice.
[3776.28s -> 3778.71s]  Yeah, that's, when you
[3778.71s -> 3781.46s]  talk to somebody on the phone. And you're
[3781.46s -> 3783.77s]  like, oh, all right. Yeah,
[3783.77s -> 3785.77s]  that's how people end conversations.
[3785.77s -> 3787.77s]  You add some inflection to let people know
[3787.77s -> 3789.77s]  that, hey, this is like, the conversation
[3789.77s -> 3792.33s]  is going to be over here in a minute.
[3792.33s -> 3794.33s]  My, my, like, here's mine.
[3794.33s -> 3796.33s]  All right. Yeah.
[3796.33s -> 3798.33s]  All right.
[3798.33s -> 3800.33s]  All right. And then it goes up real
[3800.33s -> 3802.33s]  high. All right. Yep.
[3802.33s -> 3805.59s]  Mine is usually,
[3805.59s -> 3807.59s]  it starts with, okay, so,
[3807.59s -> 3809.59s]  or it's, but,
[3809.59s -> 3811.96s]  yeah. Okay, so, I
[3811.96s -> 3815.10s]  think. How about cool?
[3815.10s -> 3817.10s]  You're doing one of the cool.
[3817.10s -> 3819.10s]  I don't know if I like cool, because
[3819.10s -> 3821.10s]  cool kind of sounds like I'm not interested in
[3821.10s -> 3823.10s]  conversation, like a cool, all
[3823.10s -> 3825.10s]  right, I gotta go. It's like, you didn't think that was cool.
[3825.10s -> 3827.10s]  If you thought that was cool, you'd just stick around a little bit longer, right?
[3827.10s -> 3829.10s]  Yeah, it's a little passive
[3829.10s -> 3831.53s]  aggressive. Yeah. I think
[3831.53s -> 3833.53s]  all right works, because all right's like, all right, like, it's over.
[3833.53s -> 3836.90s]  All right. How's
[3836.90s -> 3838.90s]  the weather on your phone, by the way?
[3838.90s -> 3841.40s]  My phone? It's pretty good.
[3841.40s -> 3843.70s]  Yep. All right.
[3843.70s -> 3846.46s]  All right.
[3846.46s -> 3848.46s]  My invites are grayed out.
[3848.46s -> 3850.46s]  There we go. I gotcha. Okay, the invites are still
[3850.46s -> 3852.46s]  grayed out, but I can invite you to the posse. We're in the same
[3852.46s -> 3854.46s]  server. Oh. All right.
[3854.46s -> 3857.46s]  Come find me. Come find me, and
[3857.46s -> 3859.96s]  come take a picture with me.
[3859.96s -> 3861.96s]  Okay. Well, I think we should try to do,
[3861.96s -> 3863.96s]  while we're in a server together, we should try to do, like,
[3863.96s -> 3865.96s]  an actual, like,
[3865.96s -> 3867.96s]  fight match. Yeah.
[3867.96s -> 3869.96s]  Okay. So it starts now,
[3869.96s -> 3872.97s]  then. I think we have to be in the posse.
[3872.97s -> 3876.42s]  Oh, okay. I thought
[3876.42s -> 3878.42s]  you meant, like, you and me are just gonna fight.
[3878.42s -> 3880.98s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I was, I was gonna say
[3880.98s -> 3883.86s]  we could do a, like,
[3883.86s -> 3886.36s]  you know, like a team death match thing.
[3886.36s -> 3888.79s]  Oh, I actually tried to load, yeah, I tried to load into one.
[3888.79s -> 3891.10s]  No, that, apparently
[3891.10s -> 3893.10s]  the weather is a little too harsh on these, yeah,
[3893.10s -> 3896.30s]  I'm disconnected.
[3896.30s -> 3898.30s]  No shit already? No shit, yep.
[3898.30s -> 3900.66s]  Already, this is way,
[3900.66s -> 3902.84s]  we at least, three days ago, we could
[3902.84s -> 3904.84s]  play for at least 20, 30 minutes
[3904.84s -> 3908.17s]  before it would do this, so. It's a shame.
[3908.17s -> 3910.17s]  This is a shame. Well, I mean, this is not, this is
[3910.17s -> 3912.17s]  not a bother to me. I want you to know
[3912.17s -> 3914.17s]  that this is also affecting me.
[3914.17s -> 3916.17s]  That's okay, it's affecting me too.
[3916.17s -> 3918.17s]  Okay. I think, let's just wait
[3918.17s -> 3920.17s]  a little bit, wait a couple days, and then we'll try
[3920.17s -> 3923.18s]  again. That sounds good to me. I wanna, I wanna
[3923.18s -> 3925.18s]  actually play this with you, but yeah, it's a
[3925.18s -> 3928.31s]  shame that this isn't happening.
[3928.31s -> 3930.31s]  It is a shame, but it's alright. It happens.
[3930.31s -> 3932.62s]  Nothing to do about it.
[3932.62s -> 3934.62s]  What are you gonna, what are you gonna cry, just cry over
[3934.62s -> 3937.11s]  spell servers? I can jump off a cliff.
[3937.11s -> 3939.67s]  Oh, I just did that.
[3939.67s -> 3941.67s]  I love how that's both the go-to
[3941.67s -> 3943.67s]  thing, whatever.
[3943.67s -> 3948.52s]  Sleep off.
[3948.52s -> 3950.52s]  You can't cry, you can't cry over
[3950.52s -> 3952.82s]  spilled servers. No, you can't.
[3952.82s -> 3955.58s]  I'm just gonna go and do
[3955.58s -> 3957.58s]  like a showdown match.
[3957.58s -> 3960.63s]  You know, I have like another
[3960.63s -> 3962.63s]  10, 20 minutes that I'm gonna play this, so
[3962.63s -> 3964.63s]  may as well play.
[3964.63s -> 3967.45s]  Oh shit, someone got a jump. Can you
[3967.45s -> 3969.45s]  explain, is it, it's
[3969.45s -> 3971.62s]  jup or jump?
[3971.62s -> 3973.62s]  It is, it is
[3973.62s -> 3975.86s]  Jupiter, jup.
[3975.86s -> 3977.86s]  Okay, because I've been saying, I think the chat tricked me into
[3977.86s -> 3979.86s]  saying jup. They did. I was like, yeah, but it's Jupiter.
[3979.86s -> 3981.86s]  It's pronounced jup. Yeah, they lied to you.
[3981.86s -> 3984.04s]  They were like, nah, bro. Yeah, figures.
[3984.04s -> 3986.04s]  I mean, I've said, I've clarified
[3986.04s -> 3988.04s]  it at least a hundred times. It is
[3988.04s -> 3990.04s]  Jupiter, the planet is Jupiter, it's not Jupiter.
[3990.04s -> 3993.37s]  Oh yeah, there's the moon, there's
[3993.37s -> 3995.37s]  the, oh, there's, there's the mon.
[3995.37s -> 3997.54s]  There's Murs.
[3997.54s -> 3999.54s]  What's back there, oh, that's Venus.
[3999.54s -> 4002.10s]  What else? Oh, Jupiter.
[4002.10s -> 4004.10s]  Oh, of course. Behind that you got
[4004.10s -> 4006.10s]  Plateau, yeah.
[4006.10s -> 4011.22s]  Plateau is my favorite, yeah.
[4011.22s -> 4013.22s]  So, can I ask you why it
[4013.22s -> 4015.22s]  exists? Because it's become a bit of
[4015.22s -> 4017.22s]  a local chat, like a lot of your memes have spilled
[4017.22s -> 4019.22s]  over into my life. I want you to know that.
[4019.22s -> 4021.53s]  Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mind.
[4021.53s -> 4023.53s]  I'm sure it's been somewhat vice versa,
[4023.53s -> 4027.94s]  but I'll take it.
[4027.94s -> 4029.94s]  Well, I don't, I just
[4029.94s -> 4032.25s]  one day was looking through
[4032.25s -> 4034.42s]  my, my mother got me
[4034.42s -> 4037.11s]  a telescope when I was younger, and
[4037.11s -> 4039.11s]  I've always been like interested in the stars
[4039.11s -> 4041.29s]  and the moon and everything.
[4041.29s -> 4043.59s]  And that just, I just, those are
[4043.59s -> 4045.59s]  images that were taken. I just
[4045.59s -> 4047.59s]  I'm into the planets and I think the solar
[4047.59s -> 4049.90s]  system's really cool and just
[4049.90s -> 4051.90s]  through the telescope I have a picture
[4051.90s -> 4054.58s]  that's able to take photos. It's one of those things
[4054.58s -> 4056.58s]  that you know of, oh, you can take binoculars, you can take pictures.
[4056.58s -> 4058.58s]  But if you're at like the baseball game
[4058.58s -> 4060.58s]  or you have a telescope and you're at the baseball
[4060.58s -> 4062.58s]  game, you want to get like a good close up of a home plate
[4062.58s -> 4064.58s]  and who's batting when you're in the bleachers.
[4064.58s -> 4066.89s]  So yeah, it's a telescopic
[4066.89s -> 4069.83s]  view of just, that's just what they look like.
[4069.83s -> 4072.78s]  Chat, is he lying? I mean,
[4072.78s -> 4074.78s]  the telescope is an incredibly expensive
[4074.78s -> 4076.78s]  it's at least like a
[4076.78s -> 4079.02s]  it's like $145. It's like
[4079.02s -> 4081.02s]  $144.99.
[4081.02s -> 4083.02s]  No, that doesn't sound like an expensive telescope.
[4083.02s -> 4085.02s]  It makes it the most expensive one you can get on Amazon.
[4085.02s -> 4089.05s]  I believe you because
[4089.05s -> 4094.30s]  I don't know why I believe you, but I do, but I
[4094.30s -> 4096.30s]  feel like I shouldn't. No, that's just
[4096.30s -> 4098.60s]  what the planets look like. Go do it.
[4098.60s -> 4100.60s]  Wait, your mother got this for you when you were like
[4100.60s -> 4102.60s]  10 and you got it on Amazon? No, no, no.
[4102.60s -> 4104.60s]  When I was younger, my mother
[4104.60s -> 4106.60s]  got me a telescope, but it's what interests me so much
[4106.60s -> 4108.60s]  in the solar system. So you bought another one?
[4108.60s -> 4110.60s]  Yeah, so years later obviously
[4110.60s -> 4112.60s]  I'm a grown man now.
[4112.60s -> 4114.60s]  You know, 20, 24 and
[4114.60s -> 4116.97s]  decided I was going to
[4116.97s -> 4118.97s]  keep my passion going and that's
[4118.97s -> 4120.97s]  the solar system and the planets and those are just
[4120.97s -> 4123.27s]  images taken from the telescope.
[4123.27s -> 4127.05s]  Wait, you're 24?
[4127.05s -> 4130.95s]  What do you mean? Chat, how much is Jerma
[4130.95s -> 4133.90s]  lying? 85% of the time.
[4133.90s -> 4138.42s]  That's probably what it is.
[4138.42s -> 4140.42s]  No, he's your age. You're my age.
[4140.42s -> 4143.82s]  Yeah, but I got
[4143.82s -> 4146.06s]  We're talking about like internal age, you know?
[4146.06s -> 4148.06s]  Right, right, how do you feel?
[4148.06s -> 4150.06s]  I feel
[4150.06s -> 4152.06s]  I feel like 45, but I mean
[4152.06s -> 4154.06s]  internally I wish I was 25.
[4154.06s -> 4156.94s]  I believe that. Alright, so I've
[4156.94s -> 4158.94s]  been in the game for more than 30 seconds
[4158.94s -> 4160.94s]  and I'm not disconnected yet.
[4160.94s -> 4162.94s]  Wait, in my game?
[4162.94s -> 4165.18s]  Am I in your game?
[4165.18s -> 4167.18s]  Are you playing a death match?
[4167.18s -> 4169.18s]  Oh, I'm not, but I'm ready for you when you come out maybe.
[4169.18s -> 4171.18s]  It's possible, it's very possible
[4171.18s -> 4173.18s]  we'll get to play for like 20 minutes.
[4173.18s -> 4175.42s]  I like the idea that we're doing a co-op match
[4175.42s -> 4177.42s]  of Red Dead, but playing separately
[4177.42s -> 4179.42s]  in separate servers.
[4179.42s -> 4183.26s]  What is Sean doing here?
[4183.26s -> 4185.56s]  So here's the thing, I wanted to
[4185.56s -> 4187.56s]  actually tell you that I also had a
[4187.56s -> 4189.56s]  telescope when I was younger. This is no bullshit.
[4189.56s -> 4191.56s]  So when you say that, I was like fucking
[4191.56s -> 4193.56s]  fascinated. I wanted to be an astronomer when I was a kid.
[4193.56s -> 4195.56s]  And I had a telescope, I had books,
[4195.56s -> 4197.56s]  I had the whole fucking thing.
[4197.56s -> 4199.56s]  I'm dead serious, which then turned into alien
[4199.56s -> 4201.56s]  conspiracies, which was the
[4201.56s -> 4203.86s]  wrong way to go about that.
[4203.86s -> 4205.86s]  Alien conspiracies.
[4205.86s -> 4208.79s]  Yeah, that's true.
[4208.79s -> 4211.03s]  Well, think about it.
[4211.03s -> 4213.03s]  No, but like honest to God, when you start to really
[4213.03s -> 4215.03s]  think about, especially when you're
[4215.03s -> 4217.72s]  younger, what's up there? You know what I mean?
[4217.72s -> 4219.72s]  You're looking up there, there's like planets and the moons
[4219.72s -> 4222.02s]  up there, what the fuck is up there?
[4222.02s -> 4224.52s]  Jupiter. Jupiter is up there.
[4224.52s -> 4228.04s]  So, if
[4228.04s -> 4230.04s]  that's true, and you got that from your telescope,
[4230.04s -> 4233.48s]  that's kind of cool. Yeah.
[4235.66s -> 4237.66s]  Your emutes don't make any sense.
[4237.66s -> 4239.90s]  They don't make any sense. I'm like, okay, go
[4239.90s -> 4242.84s]  look. Go look through a telescope
[4242.84s -> 4245.40s]  of what the moon looks like.
[4245.40s -> 4247.77s]  That's just an image.
[4247.77s -> 4249.77s]  There's a lot of people that are
[4249.77s -> 4251.77s]  spouting bullshit about me.
[4255.40s -> 4257.40s]  They keep using the word doctor,
[4257.40s -> 4259.40s]  like doctor. I'm not a doctor.
[4259.40s -> 4265.53s]  I'm a fucking streamer.
[4265.53s -> 4268.28s]  Wait, you're not? No.
[4268.28s -> 4270.28s]  So what are some jobs you've had
[4270.28s -> 4272.28s]  that you've had before you were streaming? I'm just
[4272.28s -> 4274.28s]  curious. Doctor.
[4274.28s -> 4276.28s]  Physician. Mostly.
[4281.10s -> 4283.34s]  Oddly enough, I was
[4283.34s -> 4285.34s]  a substitute teacher
[4285.34s -> 4287.51s]  for a long time. Substitute.
[4287.51s -> 4289.69s]  That's cool.
[4289.69s -> 4291.69s]  I did wedding videos
[4291.69s -> 4295.72s]  for a while. Oh, you have
[4295.72s -> 4297.72s]  video editing? Yeah. Yeah.
[4297.72s -> 4299.72s]  I did some of that too, actually.
[4299.72s -> 4301.72s]  Video editing
[4301.72s -> 4303.72s]  video, just making
[4303.72s -> 4306.34s]  freelance, just kind of on the
[4306.34s -> 4308.34s]  side when I did other stuff.
[4308.34s -> 4312.44s]  I got real
[4312.44s -> 4314.44s]  gripping, thrilling stuff going on over here.
[4314.44s -> 4316.44s]  Thanks for hanging out, guys.
[4316.44s -> 4318.44s]  Oh no, I'm talking about on my stream.
[4318.44s -> 4320.44s]  How was the weather around those jobs?
[4320.44s -> 4322.44s]  It was fucking beautiful.
[4322.44s -> 4324.44s]  I'm talking about just on my stream.
[4324.44s -> 4326.44s]  I'm just riding on a road, just
[4326.44s -> 4329.38s]  holding X.
[4329.38s -> 4332.07s]  I got real thrilling stuff over here.
[4332.07s -> 4334.82s]  As you can see.
[4334.82s -> 4336.82s]  Look at those invitations.
[4336.82s -> 4338.82s]  I can't invite you to the match I'm in, but I'm going to try
[4338.82s -> 4340.82s]  to join yours.
[4340.82s -> 4343.38s]  No, just do your thing.
[4343.38s -> 4345.38s]  I've come to the
[4345.38s -> 4347.38s]  realization that this is probably just
[4347.38s -> 4349.38s]  too good to be true.
[4349.38s -> 4351.38s]  And you're going to get in here. I'm going to take
[4351.38s -> 4353.38s]  a quality photo of you coming into the stream
[4353.38s -> 4355.38s]  into the server.
[4355.38s -> 4357.38s]  And then it's going to go
[4357.38s -> 4361.16s]  grrrr.
[4361.16s -> 4363.66s]  That's what I'm hoping.
[4363.66s -> 4365.66s]  No, I'm not. What?
[4365.66s -> 4367.66s]  I'm not hoping that happens.
[4367.66s -> 4369.66s]  I've become so conditioned to think it's going to.
[4369.66s -> 4373.30s]  Am I in your server?
[4373.30s -> 4375.30s]  No, I'm not in your server, but I will. I'm going to get in there.
[4375.30s -> 4377.30s]  Maybe we get a chance to do
[4377.30s -> 4379.30s]  one more match. Let's see.
[4379.30s -> 4381.30s]  I love that urn urn thing.
[4381.30s -> 4383.30s]  I love it.
[4383.30s -> 4385.30s]  Thanks, man. Yeah, I figured that would, you know,
[4385.30s -> 4387.30s]  that's the natural evolution of Arthur's
[4387.30s -> 4390.06s]  show.
[4390.06s -> 4392.06s]  Urn urn.
[4392.06s -> 4394.06s]  Pail boss, mate.
[4394.06s -> 4397.13s]  Okay, you've
[4397.13s -> 4399.13s]  been in a match. You've been in a server for six minutes
[4399.13s -> 4401.13s]  without disconnect, apparently.
[4401.13s -> 4403.13s]  That's pretty impressive. So I'm going to join
[4403.13s -> 4405.13s]  yours.
[4405.13s -> 4407.13s]  I want a good photo of me.
[4407.13s -> 4409.75s]  This looks pretty good right here with the snowy
[4409.75s -> 4415.58s]  mountaintop. Be careful.
[4415.58s -> 4417.82s]  Okay, I'm good. So I got a good
[4417.82s -> 4419.82s]  spot for you to come on in when you get in here.
[4419.82s -> 4427.42s]  Cool.
[4427.42s -> 4430.30s]  Enable focus lock.
[4430.30s -> 4432.30s]  So are you excited for the Detective Pokemon movie?
[4432.30s -> 4435.88s]  Detective Pokemon? Yeah.
[4435.88s -> 4438.94s]  I'm excited for it.
[4438.94s -> 4440.94s]  I think it looks really
[4440.94s -> 4442.94s]  fun.
[4442.94s -> 4446.06s]  I think so. I think so, Mr. Red.
[4446.06s -> 4448.06s]  Yeah.
[4448.06s -> 4450.06s]  Did you play Pokemon Let's Go?
[4450.06s -> 4452.06s]  I've never played
[4452.06s -> 4454.06s]  a Pokemon game before in my life.
[4454.06s -> 4456.06s]  Except for- Really? So you-
[4456.06s -> 4461.80s]  Never.
[4461.80s -> 4463.80s]  Pokemon, I think I did try
[4463.80s -> 4466.30s]  to play
[4466.30s -> 4468.30s]  Pokemon Diamond or
[4468.30s -> 4470.30s]  Pearl, whatever that was, the one for DS. Oh, there you are.
[4470.30s -> 4475.35s]  Look. Hey, mister.
[4475.35s -> 4477.66s]  Okay, I got a good photo of you.
[4477.66s -> 4479.66s]  That one's going on the album of friends.
[4479.66s -> 4483.50s]  Oh.
[4483.50s -> 4486.18s]  You're fine.
[4486.18s -> 4488.81s]  You just gave me a new face.
[4488.81s -> 4493.61s]  Hey, mister.
[4493.61s -> 4496.30s]  Alright, so
[4496.30s -> 4499.37s]  we're still here. We're not disconnected.
[4499.37s -> 4501.37s]  That's amazing. Yeah, neither
[4501.37s -> 4503.37s]  of us are ghosts. Holy shit.
[4503.37s -> 4505.37s]  I guess join the posse and then we'll
[4505.37s -> 4507.37s]  go shoot some stuff and see if that lasts.
[4507.37s -> 4509.80s]  Uh, posse.
[4509.80s -> 4512.10s]  I see your posse.
[4512.10s -> 4514.10s]  I cannot join. This posse is closed
[4514.10s -> 4516.54s]  and cannot be joined. And I have no
[4516.54s -> 4523.13s]  invites.
[4523.13s -> 4527.42s]  This is just
[4527.42s -> 4529.42s]  what happens when you go
[4529.42s -> 4531.42s]  to the bird exhibit at the local zoo.
[4531.42s -> 4533.42s]  Right?
[4533.42s -> 4535.42s]  The bird room?
[4535.42s -> 4537.42s]  Yeah, this is the bird room.
[4537.42s -> 4539.42s]  Oh, Jesus. See ya.
[4539.42s -> 4541.42s]  Goodbye. See you later.
[4541.42s -> 4543.42s]  God damn it.
[4543.42s -> 4545.42s]  You know what's funny? Your horse is still
[4545.42s -> 4547.66s]  here. Yeah, he's got a better
[4547.66s -> 4549.66s]  connection to Rockstar apparently than I do.
[4549.66s -> 4553.82s]  But anyways,
[4553.82s -> 4555.82s]  just to follow up on the bird exhibit, have you
[4555.82s -> 4557.82s]  been to a butterfly exhibit?
[4557.82s -> 4559.82s]  I have, yeah. Well, I mean,
[4559.82s -> 4561.82s]  I remember the one
[4561.82s -> 4563.82s]  time I was in Texas
[4563.82s -> 4565.82s]  in Galveston there was a
[4565.82s -> 4567.82s]  butterfly room in some place and I went in
[4567.82s -> 4569.82s]  there for a bit. I don't know why I'm telling
[4569.82s -> 4571.82s]  you this, but yes, yes.
[4571.82s -> 4573.82s]  Well, I mean, it's important because
[4573.82s -> 4575.82s]  the bird
[4575.82s -> 4577.82s]  room, the butterfly room is like the bird room
[4577.82s -> 4579.99s]  .5.
[4579.99s -> 4581.99s]  But the scary part about the butterfly room
[4581.99s -> 4583.99s]  is aren't you just terrified of
[4583.99s -> 4585.99s]  just being in there because there's just butterflies
[4585.99s -> 4587.99s]  in every direction. They're above you, they're
[4587.99s -> 4589.99s]  below you, they're left and right. I feel like
[4589.99s -> 4591.99s]  I'm just gonna like
[4591.99s -> 4593.99s]  Godzilla stomp on one of them. Yeah, like
[4593.99s -> 4595.99s]  devastate one, right? Or breathe
[4595.99s -> 4598.49s]  one in?
[4598.49s -> 4600.49s]  Maybe not that.
[4600.49s -> 4602.49s]  Breathe one in?
[4602.49s -> 4604.49s]  Like throw your nose into your lungs?
[4604.49s -> 4606.49s]  Yeah.
[4606.49s -> 4608.73s]  I guess that was kind of a
[4608.73s -> 4610.73s]  weird thing to say. But yeah, I thought
[4610.73s -> 4612.73s]  maybe that was a problem.
[4612.73s -> 4614.73s]  Next time I go to a butterfly room.
[4614.73s -> 4616.73s]  Was it Moody Gardens? Does
[4616.73s -> 4618.73s]  Moody Gardens have a butterfly room?
[4618.73s -> 4624.30s]  Moody Gardens, Butterfly.
[4624.30s -> 4626.30s]  Maybe I made that up. Maybe I lied.
[4626.30s -> 4628.30s]  Yeah, they have them. Butterfly. Rainforest
[4628.30s -> 4630.30s]  pyramid, yeah. That's that. Yep.
[4630.30s -> 4632.30s]  I've been to Moody Gardens.
[4632.30s -> 4634.47s]  Jesus Christ. I was 18 when
[4634.47s -> 4636.47s]  that happened. 15 years ago.
[4636.47s -> 4639.35s]  That's as old as some of you.
[4639.35s -> 4641.35s]  No offense.
[4641.35s -> 4643.35s]  Do you forget how long ago 15
[4643.35s -> 4645.35s]  years ago is? You know what I mean?
[4645.35s -> 4647.35s]  Yeah, I know. That's a decade
[4647.35s -> 4650.23s]  and a half.
[4650.23s -> 4652.23s]  I mean, playing on the rune of time again is weird
[4652.23s -> 4654.23s]  for that reason. Brings back a lot
[4654.23s -> 4656.23s]  of memories. So what were you saying then?
[4656.23s -> 4658.23s]  I was making a call back.
[4658.23s -> 4660.23s]  I was going, okay,
[4660.23s -> 4662.23s]  so, Butter.
[4662.23s -> 4664.23s]  Alright, alright.
[4666.41s -> 4668.41s]  How's the weather around? Let's end this.
[4668.41s -> 4670.41s]  Let me
[4670.41s -> 4672.41s]  see. What's it gonna be like?
[4672.41s -> 4674.41s]  It's gonna be cloudy
[4674.41s -> 4676.41s]  with a chance of meatballs.
[4676.41s -> 4678.41s]  Why am I typing that in?
[4678.41s -> 4680.41s]  Cloudy with a chance of disconnect.
[4680.41s -> 4682.41s]  2009. That's when that came up.
[4682.41s -> 4684.41s]  Anyone's curious.
[4684.41s -> 4686.41s]  Sorry, everybody.
[4686.41s -> 4688.41s]  I really figured it was gonna be
[4688.41s -> 4690.41s]  fun. I'm sure it was nice to have you
[4690.41s -> 4692.41s]  as a special guest. Honestly, my audience always
[4692.41s -> 4694.41s]  really enjoys talking
[4694.41s -> 4696.41s]  about you, whether it be in a positive
[4696.41s -> 4698.41s]  or negative way. They enjoy you quite a bit.
[4698.41s -> 4700.41s]  Well,
[4700.41s -> 4702.41s]  thank you. Thank you,
[4702.41s -> 4704.41s]  everybody in the Vinesauce chat. Appreciate it.
[4704.41s -> 4706.41s]  Thank you, Germachat,
[4706.41s -> 4708.41s]  for tolerating me for a couple minutes.
[4708.41s -> 4710.41s]  Everybody over here loves you, dude.
[4710.41s -> 4712.90s]  You are like,
[4712.90s -> 4714.90s]  everybody here in Hearns you over here, so don't worry.
[4714.90s -> 4716.90s]  That is nice. I like that.
[4716.90s -> 4719.21s]  That's a good compliment.
[4719.21s -> 4721.21s]  But we'll try again.
[4721.21s -> 4723.21s]  Let's see what happens during the week.
[4723.21s -> 4725.64s]  Listen, I've been having
[4725.64s -> 4727.64s]  disconnects too, so maybe one day we'll both
[4727.64s -> 4729.64s]  be able to play this.
[4729.64s -> 4731.64s]  And until then, I guess,
[4731.64s -> 4733.64s]  you know, take care of yourself.
[4733.64s -> 4735.64s]  Go find some good pictures of planets.
[4735.64s -> 4737.64s]  Yeah. And you
[4737.64s -> 4739.64s]  yourself go look up, go
[4739.64s -> 4741.64s]  get a telescope and look, and you'll see.
[4741.64s -> 4744.01s]  One day I will, maybe.
[4744.01s -> 4746.01s]  Alright. Have a good one. And until then,
[4746.01s -> 4748.01s]  I'm gonna go kill a couple dudes, and then
[4748.01s -> 4750.01s]  we'll be in touch. We'll meet somewhere in
[4750.01s -> 4752.01s]  the middle. So take care, Germachat.
[4752.01s -> 4754.01s]  See you later, guys. Take care. Bye.
[4754.01s -> 4758.81s]  I wanted to
[4758.81s -> 4760.81s]  fucking play!
[4760.81s -> 4762.81s]  I wanted to play
[4762.81s -> 4764.81s]  Money Player!
[4764.81s -> 4766.81s]  I was keeping it so, so
[4766.81s -> 4768.81s]  collected the whole time!
[4768.81s -> 4770.81s]  I just wanted to play Money
[4770.81s -> 4772.81s]  Player with my friend!
[4772.81s -> 4774.81s]  Tears are fucking pouring down my face!
[4776.81s -> 4780.52s]  You know how hard it is to contain yourself?
[4780.52s -> 4782.89s]  No, that's unfortunate. It really is.
[4782.89s -> 4784.89s]  I thought this was gonna be fixed.
[4784.89s -> 4791.22s]  Uh, Vinny,
[4791.22s -> 4793.22s]  Vinny, the great guy.
[4793.22s -> 4795.22s]  Highly recommend
[4795.22s -> 4797.40s]  If you do not follow that stream,
[4797.40s -> 4800.73s]  give it a follow.
[4800.73s -> 4802.73s]  So we can talk about one thing here.
[4802.73s -> 4804.73s]  The plan today
[4804.73s -> 4807.29s]  got a little messed up.
[4807.29s -> 4810.74s]  Vinny and Vine!
[4813.69s -> 4818.17s]  It's apparently been happening all day.
[4818.17s -> 4820.17s]  The plan was
[4820.17s -> 4822.17s]  we were only gonna play this for like
[4822.17s -> 4824.54s]  two or three hours. So
[4824.54s -> 4826.71s]  it's kind of at the point where
[4826.71s -> 4828.71s]  the plan was I was only gonna
[4828.71s -> 4830.71s]  stream for like two or three hours anyways.
[4830.71s -> 4832.71s]  So, I'm sorry guys
[4832.71s -> 4834.71s]  that this kind of in the middle
[4834.71s -> 4836.71s]  extra stream here turned out to be
[4836.71s -> 4838.71s]  a little bit of a uh, you know what I mean?
[4841.53s -> 4843.53s]  For tomorrow, the reason why this stream was
[4843.53s -> 4845.53s]  not gonna be very long is cause I'm going to
[4845.53s -> 4847.53s]  prepare the movie night.
[4847.53s -> 4849.53s]  I wanna make sure it's ready to go. I wanna make sure
[4849.53s -> 4851.53s]  that it is
[4851.53s -> 4853.53s]  uh, perfect.
[4853.53s -> 4855.53s]  There are a lot of submissions,
[4855.53s -> 4857.53s]  there are a lot of, there's a lot of work
[4857.53s -> 4859.53s]  that went into it, so
[4859.53s -> 4861.53s]  the plan was I was gonna only stream for an hour or two
[4861.53s -> 4863.53s]  and I just, I just deleted an hour for some
[4863.53s -> 4865.53s]  reason because it's been an hour or two and I'm just like
[4865.53s -> 4867.53s]  I'm like inceptioning that into your brain that the stream
[4867.53s -> 4869.53s]  is only gonna be an hour.
[4869.53s -> 4871.53s]  Um, I'm so excited for it. I'm looking
[4871.53s -> 4873.53s]  forward to it. It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[4873.53s -> 4875.53s]  So, I'm gonna end the stream here.
[4875.53s -> 4877.53s]  Uh, again, I'm sorry
[4877.53s -> 4879.53s]  about the Rockstar servers. I
[4879.53s -> 4881.53s]  really, really thought after a few days it was gonna be
[4881.53s -> 4883.53s]  fixed. So, I'm gonna go
[4883.53s -> 4885.53s]  I'm gonna go fix, uh, not fix
[4885.53s -> 4887.53s]  my internet. I'm
[4887.53s -> 4891.18s]  I'm so used to saying that.
[4891.18s -> 4893.18s]  But, I'm gonna go prepare. I wanna make sure I put a lot of
[4893.18s -> 4895.18s]  time into the movie night.
[4895.18s -> 4897.18s]  So,
[4897.18s -> 4899.18s]  uh, take care.
[4899.18s -> 4901.18s]  I'll go through the bits. It's probably gonna be very quick.
[4901.18s -> 4903.93s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. If you don't know what I'm talking
[4903.93s -> 4905.93s]  about, we're doing a movie night tomorrow
[4905.93s -> 4907.93s]  where I gave
[4907.93s -> 4909.93s]  uh, like two or three hours of brain-threat
[4909.93s -> 4911.93s]  footage to
[4911.93s -> 4913.93s]  everybody in this entire community
[4913.93s -> 4915.93s]  and some of the incredibly
[4915.93s -> 4917.93s]  talented and creative funny fucking people
[4917.93s -> 4919.93s]  that are here have made some great shit
[4919.93s -> 4921.93s]  to watch tomorrow. In the stream tomorrow,
[4921.93s -> 4923.93s]  probably only gonna be like a couple hours, two or three hours.
[4923.93s -> 4925.93s]  I don't wanna have it over states welcome. I don't want it to be
[4925.93s -> 4927.93s]  one of those scenarios where it's like, alright, we're like
[4927.93s -> 4929.93s]  five hours in and like, here's
[4929.93s -> 4931.93s]  another like me keyed in front of Minecraft.
[4931.93s -> 4933.93s]  Cause, you know,
[4933.93s -> 4935.93s]  it's inevitable.
[4935.93s -> 4938.10s]  But there are a lot of really funny fucking people in this
[4938.10s -> 4942.65s]  community. And I'm
[4942.65s -> 4944.65s]  really looking forward to it. It's been in the making
[4944.65s -> 4946.65s]  for like four months. And
[4946.65s -> 4948.65s]  um, just really glad that it's gonna be
[4948.65s -> 4950.65s]  actually a thing we do tomorrow.
[4950.65s -> 4952.65s]  So, let me go.
[4952.65s -> 4954.65s]  Uh, let's do the bits.
[4954.65s -> 4956.65s]  Really quickly.
[4956.65s -> 4959.85s]  If you just showed up.
[4959.85s -> 4961.85s]  Sorry, I didn't even tweet the stream
[4961.85s -> 4964.09s]  out, I'm glad I didn't. Cause
[4964.09s -> 4967.02s]  uh, you know, unfortunately.
[4967.02s -> 4971.56s]  There isn't actually that much
[4971.56s -> 4973.56s]  Minecraft. I know, I'm just kidding around.
[4973.56s -> 4975.99s]  I'm just playing around. For what was there, I hope you
[4975.99s -> 4977.99s]  enjoyed just hanging out. Cause we kinda just hung out
[4977.99s -> 4979.99s]  and talked about the weather. For like an hour.
[4979.99s -> 4982.17s]  Uh, if Vinny is
[4982.17s -> 4984.17s]  streaming, go watch him. Metallix is streaming, go
[4984.17s -> 4986.17s]  watch him. While I work
[4986.17s -> 4988.17s]  on some stuff.
[4988.17s -> 4994.57s]  What time tomorrow? Tomorrow at 4
[4994.57s -> 4996.57s]  pm pacific time. Is when
[4996.57s -> 4998.57s]  the stream is going to start.
[4998.57s -> 5005.67s]  4 pm pacific.
[5005.67s -> 5007.67s]  Which is 7 pm eastern.
[5007.67s -> 5009.67s]  And I am trying to
[5009.67s -> 5012.62s]  uh, I am trying
[5012.62s -> 5014.62s]  to, cause I've been so used to telling everybody
[5014.62s -> 5016.62s]  times in eastern. And I feel like
[5016.62s -> 5018.62s]  there's a lot of people that still
[5018.62s -> 5020.62s]  um, when I say, oh 4 o'clock!
[5020.62s -> 5022.62s]  A lot of people don't know I mean
[5022.62s -> 5024.62s]  pacific. Cause I've been so,
[5024.62s -> 5026.62s]  it's just, for 3, 4 years
[5026.62s -> 5028.62s]  it's been eastern.
[5028.62s -> 5030.62s]  So, that's why I keep saying the eastern times
[5030.62s -> 5034.33s]  as well. It was fun
[5034.33s -> 5036.33s]  watching you two go off cliffs together.
[5036.33s -> 5039.46s]  It was. But thank you
[5039.46s -> 5042.09s]  uh, thank you again everybody.
[5042.09s -> 5044.09s]  Thank you daf. Skeletor for the
[5044.09s -> 5046.09s]  10 bucks. No message, 10 dollars.
[5046.09s -> 5048.09s]  Uh, coconut, thanks for the 1 buck.
[5048.09s -> 5050.09s]  2 bucks actually, 3 bucks!
[5050.09s -> 5052.33s]  They say uh, plug
[5052.33s -> 5055.85s]  walk. I don't know what that means.
[5055.85s -> 5057.85s]  Thank you Divus for the 5 dollars.
[5057.85s -> 5059.85s]  No message.
[5059.85s -> 5061.85s]  Uh, Hawkeye, thank you Hawkeye
[5061.85s -> 5063.85s]  for the 30 dollars Hawkeye.
[5063.85s -> 5066.66s]  30 bucks, a little more than an hour ago.
[5066.66s -> 5072.10s]  They say, hey there Jerma,
[5072.10s -> 5074.10s]  works pretty slow right now. And there's a
[5074.10s -> 5076.10s]  snowstorm outside. So I decided to pop in and
[5076.10s -> 5078.10s]  give these that have been meeting to
[5078.10s -> 5080.10s]  donate. I work pretty late so I'm resigned
[5080.10s -> 5082.10s]  to be a slimy
[5082.10s -> 5084.10s]  vaude boy. But the laughs
[5084.10s -> 5086.60s]  are always well worth it. See you around.
[5086.60s -> 5088.60s]  Thank you for the 30 dollars and
[5088.60s -> 5090.60s]  slimy vaude
[5090.60s -> 5094.44s]  boy. That's
[5094.44s -> 5098.73s]  slimy vaude boy. But thank you
[5098.73s -> 5102.31s]  so much Hawkeye. 30 dollars,
[5102.31s -> 5104.31s]  lots of money. Sorry that the stream
[5104.31s -> 5106.49s]  that you gave that money on was
[5106.49s -> 5108.49s]  uh, not even, I would even
[5108.49s -> 5110.49s]  not even classify the, it's been
[5110.49s -> 5112.49s]  like an hour and a half.
[5112.49s -> 5115.05s]  Um, don't worry. We got tomorrow
[5115.05s -> 5117.05s]  night, we got a very very good
[5117.05s -> 5119.05s]  fun stream ready to go. So
[5119.05s -> 5121.05s]  thank you. Thank you Garf for the
[5121.05s -> 5123.05s]  Monday killer for the one dollar. My name is Garf and I'm here
[5123.05s -> 5125.05s]  to say I eat lasagna every day.
[5125.05s -> 5127.05s]  Yo yo Jerma, it's Garf the rapper here.
[5127.05s -> 5129.05s]  I'm hoping to reboot my rap career.
[5129.05s -> 5131.05s]  Yes there's a six minute Garfield rap in the
[5131.05s -> 5133.05s]  early 90s. Uh, speaking of reinventing
[5133.05s -> 5135.05s]  your image, have you heard of those two Shrek
[5135.05s -> 5137.05s]  remakes? Well you just said Shrek so
[5137.05s -> 5139.86s]  I'm censoring the rest of this comment.
[5139.86s -> 5141.86s]  Won by the guy who made the minions and the
[5141.86s -> 5144.04s]  fan made one. The fan
[5144.04s -> 5146.04s]  made one called Shrek retold was
[5146.04s -> 5149.11s]  released two days ago. Every scene is
[5149.11s -> 5152.06s]  directed by a different artist. What movie would you
[5152.06s -> 5154.06s]  want remade by fans?
[5154.06s -> 5160.82s]  Um, I don't
[5160.82s -> 5163.45s]  know. Probably
[5163.45s -> 5166.58s]  maybe you could try
[5166.58s -> 5168.58s]  Why am I taking this comment seriously? Uh,
[5168.58s -> 5172.04s]  what movie? I would
[5172.04s -> 5176.46s]  say, uh, crocodile
[5176.46s -> 5179.14s]  Dundee. There's some stuff
[5179.14s -> 5181.51s]  there that could be done maybe. Uh, thank you
[5181.51s -> 5183.51s]  Jess for the one dollar. When I was a kid I used
[5183.51s -> 5186.89s]  to say, uh,
[5186.89s -> 5188.89s]  Chay Kane instead of Keychain.
[5188.89s -> 5190.89s]  I couldn't shake it for years. I would
[5190.89s -> 5192.89s]  also say sunshine
[5192.89s -> 5194.89s]  every time. I remember this. I can't say it
[5194.89s -> 5196.89s]  normally for days after.
[5196.89s -> 5198.89s]  Cheshire Trust. It's a Cheshire
[5198.89s -> 5200.89s]  Trust at this point. It's not a treasure chest.
[5200.89s -> 5204.92s]  It's hard to say it the other way.
[5204.92s -> 5206.92s]  But thank you. Thank you ExtraCheesy for the one dollar. He says
[5206.92s -> 5208.92s]  he doesn't eat, but yeah, the whole
[5208.92s -> 5211.80s]  taquitos things. Uh, ExtraCheesy
[5211.80s -> 5213.80s]  thanks again for the ten dollars here. Here's
[5213.80s -> 5215.80s]  what you said you never did before.
[5215.80s -> 5229.82s]  What the hell is this? I'm
[5229.82s -> 5233.40s]  eating taco
[5233.40s -> 5235.40s]  You drive dude. I'm eating.
[5235.40s -> 5238.22s]  That's not even me. Four?
[5238.22s -> 5242.38s]  Eat four taquitos at the same time.
[5242.38s -> 5244.38s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5244.38s -> 5246.62s]  When did I do this?
[5246.62s -> 5250.26s]  I don't remember putting
[5250.26s -> 5252.26s]  like five fucking taquitos in my mouth.
[5252.26s -> 5255.72s]  Hold on a second.
[5271.13s -> 5275.16s]  This is one of the last streams before I left.
[5275.16s -> 5277.16s]  Oh. Oh, okay.
[5277.16s -> 5280.94s]  You drive dude. I'm eating.
[5280.94s -> 5284.14s]  Four? One, two,
[5284.14s -> 5286.63s]  three, four. I don't
[5286.63s -> 5288.63s]  do this, do I? This is a joke, right?
[5288.63s -> 5292.66s]  I'm not doing it.
[5292.66s -> 5302.01s]  I knew it.
[5302.01s -> 5304.01s]  I knew it. I knew I wasn't
[5304.01s -> 5306.18s]  gonna do it. We got a helicopter
[5306.18s -> 5308.18s]  dude. We got a helicopter. Okay
[5308.18s -> 5310.18s]  I've had enough of that.
[5314.90s -> 5316.90s]  I thought you guys were talking about Vinny.
[5319.85s -> 5322.54s]  I've never eaten a taquito
[5322.54s -> 5324.54s]  in my life.
[5324.54s -> 5327.48s]  It's so funny cause that was
[5327.48s -> 5329.48s]  that wasn't like five years ago
[5329.48s -> 5331.48s]  that wasn't like three years ago. That was like
[5331.48s -> 5333.48s]  two months ago.
[5336.41s -> 5341.08s]  Oh
[5343.08s -> 5345.08s]  How do you guys remember these things?
[5345.08s -> 5347.08s]  Good thing you keep me honest.
[5347.08s -> 5349.51s]  But thank you Extra Cheesy for that.
[5349.51s -> 5351.51s]  Ten dollars, eleven dollars, twelve dollars.
[5351.51s -> 5353.51s]  And I want
[5353.51s -> 5355.82s]  the red badge. Thank you
[5355.82s -> 5358.31s]  Extra Cheesy. Red badge.
[5358.31s -> 5360.31s]  Mark Bosh Magali
[5360.31s -> 5362.31s]  thanks for the one dollar. The disconnect joke was really
[5362.31s -> 5364.31s]  interesting. Not sure what you were trying to accomplish.
[5364.31s -> 5366.31s]  Either way, it was nice seeing you
[5366.31s -> 5368.31s]  with Vinny. Take care.
[5368.31s -> 5370.31s]  The disconnecting from
[5370.31s -> 5373.32s]  the game joke. That's too
[5373.32s -> 5376.39s]  bad. That's too
[5376.39s -> 5380.36s]  bad. But
[5380.36s -> 5382.36s]  I would be more upset about this
[5382.36s -> 5384.36s]  if, cause I know that he
[5384.36s -> 5387.24s]  when we talked about doing this he was like
[5387.24s -> 5389.24s]  oh let's do this. This sounds like fun. Like let's give
[5389.24s -> 5391.24s]  it a few days though cause there's internet problems. There's like
[5391.24s -> 5393.24s]  Rockstar servers are kinda fucked up or whatever
[5393.24s -> 5395.42s]  right. I'm just glad that he
[5395.42s -> 5397.42s]  was already streaming something. He was doing
[5397.42s -> 5399.42s]  something. This wasn't like a okay
[5399.42s -> 5401.42s]  here's the stream for today.
[5401.42s -> 5403.42s]  He had already been playing like Ocarina of Time
[5403.42s -> 5405.42s]  and I'm really glad that it wasn't
[5405.42s -> 5407.42s]  just like oh hey let's just
[5407.42s -> 5409.42s]  let's just ruin this stream.
[5409.42s -> 5412.47s]  So. And
[5412.47s -> 5414.47s]  on this end at least that this was
[5414.47s -> 5416.47s]  an in between to tomorrow.
[5416.47s -> 5418.47s]  And we streamed yesterday, streamed tomorrow
[5418.47s -> 5420.47s]  and I'm just glad that this wasn't
[5420.47s -> 5422.47s]  you know oh that's it.
[5422.47s -> 5426.18s]  Red dead connection.
[5426.18s -> 5430.73s]  Yeah. Sorry
[5430.73s -> 5432.73s]  again everybody. I wish
[5432.73s -> 5434.73s]  I could snap my fingers and magically
[5434.73s -> 5436.73s]  have it not happen but
[5436.73s -> 5438.73s]  I'm actually going to do a little bit of research
[5438.73s -> 5440.73s]  because the stuff that I read
[5440.73s -> 5442.73s]  about it there's like workarounds
[5442.73s -> 5444.73s]  and I tried the workarounds
[5444.73s -> 5446.73s]  already. They didn't work.
[5446.73s -> 5449.10s]  But maybe there's some other things to try.
[5449.10s -> 5451.72s]  But thank you Marvish
[5451.72s -> 5453.72s]  Magali. Thank you Hunter Kane for the one dollar. Have some
[5453.72s -> 5456.22s]  bits. Thanks. Mostly lost thanks for
[5456.22s -> 5458.22s]  the one dollar. You should host Vinny or
[5458.22s -> 5460.22s]  Italics. You do know how the host button works right?
[5460.22s -> 5462.97s]  I don't know what
[5462.97s -> 5464.97s]  you mean like they
[5464.97s -> 5467.72s]  appear like I hope
[5467.72s -> 5469.72s]  they appear inside of me.
[5469.72s -> 5477.06s]  What do you mean? Like I have to
[5477.06s -> 5479.06s]  be inside. That's like a that's like a tapeworm.
[5479.06s -> 5484.38s]  I don't think I want that.
[5484.38s -> 5486.38s]  That's how the movie Venom starts.
[5486.38s -> 5491.69s]  I don't think I want that.
[5491.69s -> 5493.69s]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[5493.69s -> 5497.08s]  ha ha. Hey thank you
[5497.08s -> 5499.08s]  D Jack for the one dollar. I rewatched the Zoo Tycoon stream
[5499.08s -> 5501.08s]  and nearly shit myself with the T-Rex not being
[5501.08s -> 5503.08s]  able to find his car joke. Keep bringing
[5503.08s -> 5507.50s]  the chuckles. Thank you D Jack.
[5507.50s -> 5511.14s]  It was a fun stream. Spoilers.
[5511.14s -> 5513.14s]  Oh sorry. Sorry guys.
[5513.14s -> 5516.15s]  Venom is a symbiote. Sorry.
[5516.15s -> 5518.15s]  Sorry for the spoils.
[5518.15s -> 5520.15s]  And Smelly Boy right at the end. When are you going to play
[5520.15s -> 5522.15s]  Metal Gear Rising? Tomorrow.
[5522.15s -> 5524.15s]  No it's a lie. I'm kidding. Not tomorrow.
[5524.15s -> 5526.33s]  Tomorrow we're doing the...
[5526.33s -> 5533.69s]  No. Tomorrow we're doing the movie night.
[5533.69s -> 5539.38s]  How long is the stream going to be
[5539.38s -> 5542.01s]  tomorrow? That's up
[5542.01s -> 5544.01s]  for potential debate because
[5544.01s -> 5546.18s]  after I turn the stream off
[5546.18s -> 5548.18s]  here I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[5548.18s -> 5550.18s]  I'm going to go grab a drink and then sit down
[5550.18s -> 5552.18s]  and really get it hammered out.
[5552.18s -> 5554.81s]  And I don't know.
[5554.81s -> 5556.81s]  I'm going to assume it's going to be
[5556.81s -> 5558.81s]  like less than two or three hours long.
[5558.81s -> 5561.24s]  Because we're just going to be watching a playlist.
[5561.24s -> 5563.24s]  We're watching a huge community
[5563.24s -> 5567.90s]  playlist. So
[5567.90s -> 5571.99s]  I'm going to assume up to three hours.
[5571.99s -> 5575.32s]  It's one minute max. Two minutes max.
[5575.32s -> 5577.32s]  I plan on, I'm just going to tell you
[5577.32s -> 5579.32s]  just a fair warning, I plan on drinking a little bit
[5579.32s -> 5581.94s]  of wine. This is the sun.
[5581.94s -> 5583.94s]  It's been a couple of, it's been like two or three
[5583.94s -> 5586.57s]  weeks since I've had some good wine.
[5586.57s -> 5591.54s]  It's going to be a red blend.
[5591.54s -> 5593.54s]  But that is
[5593.54s -> 5595.54s]  it. Here come the credits
[5595.54s -> 5597.54s]  for the short stream that was
[5597.54s -> 5599.98s]  here. Thank you for
[5599.98s -> 5601.98s]  subscribing and contributing
[5601.98s -> 5603.98s]  everybody. It means a lot.
[5603.98s -> 5607.43s]  I wish it was better circumstances.
[5607.43s -> 5610.50s]  He's going to eat food and forget.
[5610.50s -> 5616.33s]  And there's also
[5616.33s -> 5618.33s]  a very, very real
[5618.33s -> 5621.46s]  possibility where the
[5621.46s -> 5623.77s]  it's broken up into two nights.
[5623.77s -> 5627.40s]  You know what I mean? Because if
[5627.40s -> 5629.40s]  there are, if there's more than four
[5629.40s -> 5631.40s]  or five hours of
[5631.40s -> 5634.02s]  videos to watch, then it might,
[5634.02s -> 5636.02s]  it'll be better probably to break it up into two
[5636.02s -> 5645.11s]  separate occasions. It depends.
[5645.11s -> 5647.11s]  I mean, maybe we'll just do the whole thing. It really depends
[5647.11s -> 5649.11s]  on how long the whole, after going
[5649.11s -> 5651.29s]  through and
[5651.29s -> 5653.29s]  making sure that it's cleaned up
[5653.29s -> 5655.29s]  and some duplicates are removed
[5655.29s -> 5657.29s]  or ones that weren't
[5657.29s -> 5659.29s]  following the rules or ones that just didn't make
[5659.29s -> 5661.29s]  any sense. Once it's cleaned up a little
[5661.29s -> 5674.92s]  bit, we'll find out. I can watch it at
[5674.92s -> 5676.92s]  times two speed.
[5676.92s -> 5681.06s]  Don't
[5681.06s -> 5683.06s]  watch them. What do you mean don't watch them?
[5683.06s -> 5685.88s]  Ones that don't make any sense.
[5685.88s -> 5687.88s]  Here's what I'm talking about. If there's like
[5687.88s -> 5690.25s]  we need to shave time off,
[5690.25s -> 5692.25s]  here's the reason why these all had to
[5692.25s -> 5694.25s]  be screened and had to be
[5694.25s -> 5696.25s]  predetermined if they were
[5696.25s -> 5698.25s]  capable of being on. Because the rules
[5698.25s -> 5700.25s]  that I set forth were original
[5700.25s -> 5702.25s]  content encouraged,
[5702.25s -> 5704.25s]  more than 10 seconds, less than two minutes,
[5704.25s -> 5706.25s]  like give or take
[5706.25s -> 5708.25s]  some people, if you go over by
[5708.25s -> 5710.25s]  five seconds or so, like okay,
[5710.25s -> 5712.25s]  as long as, or ten seconds, whatever,
[5712.25s -> 5714.25s]  if the video was made well,
[5714.25s -> 5716.25s]  we're just trying to see how that works.
[5716.25s -> 5718.25s]  But, there weren't very many
[5718.25s -> 5720.25s]  other rules
[5720.25s -> 5722.25s]  in regards to, well, I mean, obviously there was no
[5722.25s -> 5724.25s]  hateful shit, there was no sexual stuff,
[5724.25s -> 5726.25s]  obviously. But,
[5726.25s -> 5728.25s]  the reason why we have to go through them all
[5728.25s -> 5730.25s]  is because somebody could just put up
[5730.25s -> 5732.25s]  hey, here's my, here's my submission
[5732.25s -> 5734.25s]  and it's a minute and 58 seconds
[5734.25s -> 5736.25s]  of a black screen and then it flashes me
[5736.25s -> 5738.25s]  on the screen for one second.
[5738.25s -> 5740.25s]  That one's not going on, we're not putting
[5740.25s -> 5742.25s]  that one on the video, you know what I mean? That's not going on.
[5742.25s -> 5745.45s]  Like, that shit's not going on.
[5745.45s -> 5747.62s]  That's just a waste of time,
[5747.62s -> 5749.62s]  you know what I mean? Time is of the essence
[5749.62s -> 5755.58s]  tomorrow. And so, there's been
[5755.58s -> 5757.58s]  a few submissions that have
[5757.58s -> 5759.58s]  just been, just absolute,
[5759.58s -> 5761.58s]  just carnage,
[5761.58s -> 5763.58s]  just keyed out, just
[5763.58s -> 5765.58s]  volume at max,
[5765.58s -> 5767.58s]  blasting music, and just
[5767.58s -> 5769.58s]  like, and every one of the
[5769.58s -> 5771.58s]  green screens just like flying around and stuff.
[5771.58s -> 5773.58s]  For like two minutes.
[5773.58s -> 5776.26s]  It's like,
[5776.26s -> 5778.26s]  there's been some wild submissions,
[5778.26s -> 5780.26s]  so we need to make sure that we have
[5780.26s -> 5782.26s]  ones that aren't going to be obviously,
[5782.26s -> 5784.26s]  you know, blow anybody's ears out.
[5784.26s -> 5791.11s]  That sounds amazing.
[5791.11s -> 5793.11s]  And if, yo, I didn't say there was
[5793.11s -> 5795.11s]  anything wrong with it, but for the purposes of
[5795.11s -> 5797.11s]  tomorrow's viewing,
[5797.11s -> 5799.61s]  it needs to be at least fairly
[5799.61s -> 5810.10s]  structured. I've
[5810.10s -> 5812.10s]  I've tried to abstain from watching as many
[5812.10s -> 5814.10s]  of them as I can, but there are a lot of occasions
[5814.10s -> 5816.10s]  where I do have to watch them,
[5816.10s -> 5818.10s]  because I'm not sure, is this one okay?
[5818.10s -> 5820.10s]  Is this one kind of pushing the line
[5820.10s -> 5822.10s]  a little bit, and I have to watch them. I have to watch
[5822.10s -> 5824.10s]  a lot of them, pretty much.
[5824.10s -> 5826.10s]  But, because there's been
[5826.10s -> 5828.10s]  the mod team has been doing an absolutely
[5828.10s -> 5830.10s]  fucking fantastic job
[5830.10s -> 5832.34s]  to keep this
[5832.34s -> 5834.34s]  where I don't see very many
[5834.34s -> 5838.38s]  of them, you know what I mean?
[5838.38s -> 5840.38s]  But they do need to be watched, and I go, alright, I don't know about
[5840.38s -> 5845.94s]  that. Have somebody watch them for you.
[5845.94s -> 5847.94s]  That is essentially
[5847.94s -> 5853.77s]  what the mods have been doing.
[5853.77s -> 5856.01s]  It's been a huge fucking help.
[5856.01s -> 5858.01s]  That they deserve praise, they deserve
[5858.01s -> 5860.01s]  all the love you can give them.
[5860.01s -> 5865.18s]  And they deserve
[5865.18s -> 5869.85s]  compensation.
[5869.85s -> 5874.52s]  Because that's a lot of work. Especially this.
[5874.52s -> 5881.18s]  Yeah, coming, bits coming
[5881.18s -> 5888.66s]  your way.
[5888.66s -> 5890.66s]  Because, I mean, I'll be real here for a minute.
[5890.66s -> 5892.66s]  There's been occasions where
[5892.66s -> 5896.12s]  you know, you just can't do
[5896.12s -> 5898.74s]  it alone, you know what I mean?
[5898.74s -> 5900.74s]  There's been at least three or four streams that
[5900.74s -> 5903.61s]  just
[5903.61s -> 5905.61s]  without the help of at least
[5905.61s -> 5907.61s]  three, four of these mods.
[5907.61s -> 5909.61s]  There's no way that the streams would have even been
[5909.61s -> 5911.61s]  in reality, never would have been in reality, ever.
[5911.61s -> 5915.82s]  So, big thanks.
[5915.82s -> 5922.54s]  In reality.
[5922.54s -> 5925.99s]  And thank you all the subs, everybody
[5925.99s -> 5929.13s]  that just came in. Get excited for tomorrow,
[5929.13s -> 5940.65s]  it's gonna be a lot of fun. And finally,
[5940.65s -> 5942.65s]  right at the very end,
[5942.65s -> 5944.65s]  we had mostly lost
[5944.65s -> 5946.65s]  with the dollar. Also, thanks to you, I'm never gonna be able to drink
[5946.65s -> 5948.65s]  a red blend again without laughing.
[5948.65s -> 5950.65s]  Oh, come on, it's the best. It's the best.
[5950.65s -> 5953.66s]  I should have asked, I should have asked
[5953.66s -> 5956.15s]  a video about that. He would know.
[5956.15s -> 5958.15s]  He would be like, yeah, of course.
[5958.15s -> 5960.90s]  Mr. Picklesworth, thanks for the one dollar.
[5960.90s -> 5962.90s]  Hey, Jerma, how you doing today? I think I got banned from the discord
[5962.90s -> 5964.90s]  because I said, give,
[5964.90s -> 5968.49s]  I give back
[5968.49s -> 5970.49s]  a couple of times in the chat
[5970.49s -> 5972.49s]  when you took away the image posting.
[5972.49s -> 5974.98s]  Sorry, if my messages were spammy.
[5974.98s -> 5977.67s]  Hit up one of the
[5977.67s -> 5979.67s]  mods in a private message.
[5979.67s -> 5981.67s]  They will take care of it. They will
[5981.67s -> 5983.67s]  just, they will take a look and see what happened.
[5983.67s -> 5990.46s]  I hope it's not too late for you to see this.
[5990.46s -> 5995.94s]  No. And just
[5995.94s -> 5997.94s]  also remember something.
[5997.94s -> 5999.94s]  If somebody gets from the discord
[5999.94s -> 6001.94s]  or in this channel,
[6001.94s -> 6003.94s]  if you get like banned,
[6003.94s -> 6006.89s]  for the, all
[6006.89s -> 6008.89s]  bans, like permanent, we're talking like
[6008.89s -> 6011.13s]  bans, are
[6011.13s -> 6013.13s]  discussed. And it's not just like, hey,
[6013.13s -> 6016.58s]  you got banned. And there's usually
[6016.58s -> 6018.58s]  a dialogue you can open up to
[6018.58s -> 6020.58s]  potentially talk about what happened
[6020.58s -> 6022.82s]  or why or
[6022.82s -> 6030.95s]  that does happen. So
[6030.95s -> 6032.95s]  all hands are disgust.
[6032.95s -> 6041.53s]  Can I negotiate
[6041.53s -> 6043.53s]  why I should be banned? You could, yeah.
[6043.53s -> 6046.54s]  You could. If you really
[6046.54s -> 6051.59s]  wanted to. But that's going to be
[6051.59s -> 6053.77s]  it. See you guys tomorrow.
[6053.77s -> 6057.22s]  Four p.m. Pacific. I'm excited.
[6057.22s -> 6059.22s]  You're excited. We're all excited.
[6059.22s -> 6062.62s]  Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[6062.62s -> 6065.82s]  Sorry again
[6065.82s -> 6068.12s]  for Rockstar's servers
[6068.12s -> 6070.92s]  not working. Good night.
[6070.92s -> 6074.04s]  Take care. See you tomorrow.
