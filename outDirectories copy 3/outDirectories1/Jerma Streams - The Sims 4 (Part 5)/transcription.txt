[4.41s -> 12.74s]  I know, I know. I've seen it spamming chat. Listen, I know. I had to take a few important
[12.74s -> 18.66s]  phone calls and they happened at exactly 12 o'clock and then at 1230. So I'm sorry.
[18.66s -> 28.41s]  I'm very nervous because I've heard the voice crack. It's not four, it's not three, it's one.
[29.13s -> 33.45s]  That's pretty good. That's pretty good. That means I can stream for at least five to six
[33.45s -> 43.51s]  hours without running into 730 PM internet turn off issue. That's pretty good. I did say that like
[43.51s -> 52.42s]  between 12 and one, I did say one. I'm even late to being one, but whoa. What's going on?
[53.06s -> 61.85s]  Why is my Twitch dashboard saying that the stream is like dead? Is everything okay?
[69.48s -> 74.36s]  My Twitch dashboard, it has a bright red thing that is telling me that this is not good.
[75.77s -> 84.86s]  That's weird. Why is it showing me that? Okay. Well, whatever. We're going to play some Sims 4
[84.86s -> 91.32s]  again today. Same character, same world that we're in. The only difference today is I did install,
[92.60s -> 98.12s]  I want to say about maybe seven or eight mods. Some of them were wacky, but I don't, I'm going
[98.12s -> 107.64s]  to use them sparingly. I'm just going to make this really clear that everybody that thinks that I'm
[107.64s -> 113.00s]  going to be hanging out in the house and the person in the house is going to tell a bad joke
[113.00s -> 117.40s]  and I'm going to literally run them over with a car. I'm not going to do that. We're going to use
[117.40s -> 130.65s]  these very sparingly. All like the cartoon Tom and Jerry hit somebody in the head with a mallet
[130.65s -> 138.60s]  kind of shit. We're not doing that unless it's going to be very sparingly because I can't start
[138.60s -> 151.67s]  late. I have to start on time. I did. Just do it your way. All right. No, I didn't get any of those
[151.67s -> 158.44s]  mods. Why do you, what do you think for all the people that have been kind of bringing it up over
[158.44s -> 167.66s]  the last 12 to 15 hours or so you can, you can't, I can't do those mods. They're not allowed. They
[167.66s -> 180.30s]  are not allowed on Twitch. They're not allowed. Yeah. If you're a coward, no, if I'd like to keep
[180.30s -> 189.62s]  my channel active, well, I'm going to get banned from Twitch and indefinite ban from Twitch and
[189.62s -> 202.42s]  then write a tweet being like, yeah, at least I wasn't a coward. What, what? No. Oh, people ask.
[202.42s -> 207.38s]  Yeah. I want to mention this too. People asking about the VIP changes. So I, I completely removed
[207.38s -> 215.22s]  VIP as a role. I just, I just dropped it. There's only one VIP on this whole channel anymore.
[217.66s -> 225.86s]  And it's my girlfriend. So VIP is gone. I just got rid of it. I thought maybe, oh, would I give it
[225.86s -> 229.78s]  to like other streamers or game devs? No, just the whole thing is gone. Just get rid of the whole
[229.78s -> 251.58s]  thing. Get rid of it. Nepotism. Good afternoon, Mr. 985. Hey, good afternoon. No, I'm honestly,
[251.58s -> 257.26s]  the whole, the whole role is just going away. VIP, I didn't want it to turn into this, but it kind
[257.26s -> 262.62s]  of turned into sort of a commodity over the years. It started to get some pretty real value behind
[262.62s -> 278.52s]  it, which I really don't like. So I just decided to remove it. It's just gone. Will you be quiet
[278.52s -> 296.97s]  today? No, let me be quiet. Those of you that don't know, I thought about adding new VIPs
[296.97s -> 306.78s]  a while back and it can get a little awkward when people can essentially kind of bring up, hey,
[306.78s -> 313.91s]  why, why did I not get VIP? Why did they get VIP? What, who deserves VIP? What did they do?
[313.91s -> 320.15s]  And it's almost like you have to start to like prove that somebody deserves VIP for some reason.
[320.95s -> 327.32s]  And I just, I just don't want to do that. I'm just not going to do that. So nobody gets VIP
[327.32s -> 342.41s]  anymore. Oh, there's one person that gets to be, whatever that word. It's me. I'm just like passed
[342.41s -> 349.24s]  out after saying it loud. I'm kidding. I'm relaxed. You know, I thought about VIPing Ball Fondler.
[349.24s -> 361.61s]  I thought about it. I thought about him being the only one and then just mute everybody and just let
[361.61s -> 375.54s]  him talk for five minutes and then permanently ban him forever. Paulie just said, you don't have
[375.54s -> 387.29s]  to give me VIP. Well, I did it on my, for my own reason. It's pretty fair. That's really powerful.
[387.29s -> 399.75s]  Don't do that. Do it. I'm not going to do that, but yeah, as we continue to go here, I don't,
[399.75s -> 407.22s]  I don't think VIP kind of is just not something I really want on the channel anymore. Call me a
[407.22s -> 411.94s]  weirdo if you want, but that's just the way it is. I don't like having to pick and choose people
[412.50s -> 418.26s]  and then have people potentially, I'm not saying this has happened, but potentially get angry or
[418.26s -> 422.74s]  annoyed. And then I have to come up with a bunch of reasons why somebody did or didn't get it.
[423.38s -> 439.77s]  Isn't Ball Fondler banned? Oh, well, nevermind. Change your pinned tweet. I will eventually.
[440.49s -> 446.22s]  Oh no, no, no, he's unbanned. He got unbanned during baseball. Hasn't been rebanned yet. Okay.
[446.22s -> 458.25s]  Well, be careful then. What are your thoughts on chemistry? I don't think it's important.
[458.97s -> 466.62s]  It's a, and it helps us kind of understand our world better. Helps us kind of understand
[467.66s -> 479.29s]  how the, you know, things react. It helps us understand our world. Okay. Are you guys ready
[479.29s -> 483.45s]  to play The Sims 4? And again, I'm not just going, people are not, I'm telling you right
[483.45s -> 486.97s]  now, people are just going to be spamming it and I'm telling you mods, take care of this.
[487.61s -> 493.86s]  I don't want to see, you know, like kill them, attack him, attack him, punch him. No,
[493.86s -> 498.02s]  we're playing The Sims 4 and I'm going to be a, one of the mods is actually kind of funny.
[498.02s -> 509.35s]  I don't want to spoil it. Sparingly. All right. You guys ready? You guys even see it? No, I haven't.
[509.35s -> 515.24s]  Okay. I, I don't, I don't know how much, what is it? Autonomy, right? I don't know how much
[515.24s -> 519.08s]  autonomy these mods have. So I'm going to make sure I have a save point in case somebody just
[519.08s -> 525.16s]  gets hit by a car, like in the first five minutes. Also, I did some exercises. I did,
[525.16s -> 528.04s]  I did some very light stretching and breathing exercises for the last,
[528.04s -> 532.44s]  it's why I was late for another 10 minutes because if I laugh really hard, I'm going to get hurt.
[532.44s -> 541.45s]  So I need to be ready. I have to be aware of this. Okay. Are you, are you ready? We're still in,
[541.45s -> 554.34s]  we're in, oh, I think we're in Batuu still, I think. Can you guys hear it? How do I get out of
[554.34s -> 563.05s]  here? This is a weird angle. This is a normal angle. This is an, this, look, this is a normal
[563.05s -> 572.54s]  angle. I'm just chest up in frame on a webcam. I want you to explain how this is weird. I need
[572.54s -> 584.22s]  to know why this is weird. It's chest up angled webcam. This is a scripted angle. You're inside
[584.22s -> 598.82s]  out. YouTuber Andy. I am a YouTuber. I was a YouTuber for six years. The door should be on
[598.82s -> 613.06s]  the other side. What? We've got architects in here now? This is an iPad zoom angle. All right,
[613.06s -> 633.70s]  let's go. Okay. So there is autonomy because this is a Fortnite dance. Okay. We need to,
[633.70s -> 645.32s]  let's leave. We should get out of here. Is it, why am I getting a skill? All that's missing is like
[645.32s -> 659.48s]  a bone on a tripod facing this way. Where's Santa? There are no game sounds. It should be.
[659.93s -> 664.98s]  Can you not hear anything? Oh, I had him off. It's really weird with that, without any music here.
[664.98s -> 678.06s]  This is what I've been hearing. Guys in his own world. My acquaintance was telling me how much
[678.06s -> 688.86s]  they dislike you. Try being a little nicer, becoming disliked as a slippery slope. Okay.
[688.86s -> 700.09s]  You have a suede green screen background. All right. It's, I'm done with, with this area. Can
[700.09s -> 711.64s]  I go home now? Oh, I hope I didn't break anything with the mods. Dance skill acquired. Blorg is
[711.64s -> 716.17s]  busting some moves. He has unlocked some new dance moves and can show off the arm
[716.17s -> 735.43s]  charm dance move on the dance floor. What? What's the, what's the orange T-shirt kid?
[748.17s -> 757.88s]  There is, what do you mean there's no sound? What? This, there is definitely sound.
[757.88s -> 768.01s]  There, I can see it right here. He thinks we can't see the green screen. Oh my God. All right.
[768.01s -> 773.34s]  How do I leave? I don't want to, I want to get out of this vacation. It's already all
[773.34s -> 777.94s]  fucked up. I knew this was going to happen. I just was about to hit this guy with the car.
[778.58s -> 781.54s]  I knew this was going to happen. I'm, I told you this is why I can't,
[784.38s -> 791.86s]  we have to go home right now. It's quiet. The second that I see somebody start doing a Fortnite
[791.86s -> 796.02s]  dance, it's like, it's over. Like I can't just play the Sims now. I knew this was going to happen.
[796.02s -> 811.18s]  How do I get out of here? I want to get out of the vacation. Does anyone know how to leave?
[811.82s -> 827.29s]  By the way, you can't do this for this long. He's probably exhausted. Use the phone. Okay. End
[827.29s -> 840.20s]  vacation. End the vacation, please. Yes. Okay. That was fun. We had a lot of time.
[841.32s -> 848.50s]  We had a lot of fun at the, at, at who? It was cool. Do that until he passes out. All right.
[848.50s -> 855.85s]  Here we are. So welcome back. The Petsitter took good care of Yodel. All right. Cool.
[855.85s -> 880.50s]  I love how twerk for money is there. Sing?
[880.50s -> 896.23s]  Oh, no, this is, this is not a mod. Okay. No, I don't. Oh, hold on. I got to take it.
[896.23s -> 904.42s]  I'm not even using these. These are going to be used very sparingly. You're already in the extreme
[904.42s -> 914.06s]  violence sub menu. No, I was, I, I didn't even look at it. I don't even know what's there.
[914.06s -> 930.71s]  Let me change career paths. I need to change career paths. It's very important. Uh, find a job.
[930.71s -> 954.42s]  I didn't tweet the stream out. God damn it. I'll do it in a minute. Okay. Is it here? Where is it?
[954.42s -> 972.36s]  Did I inst- there it is. I can be a Warcraft War Chief for the Horde. Of course I'm quitting
[972.36s -> 987.00s]  that job. All right. So achieve level one fitness, level two logic. I get to be like a War Chief.
[987.00s -> 999.37s]  All right. Cooking charisma. I thought we were going to start Fortnite dancing.
[999.37s -> 1008.01s]  That's the dream job. Okay. So I need logic. How do I get logic again? I only have 400 bucks.
[1008.01s -> 1015.00s]  Cooking though. We can maybe practice cooking. I guys, I forgot everything that I installed here.
[1015.00s -> 1021.67s]  Um, I know that I installed wear objects as hats. That's one, I guess. There's also like the,
[1021.67s -> 1038.15s]  you can punch people. You can attack people. That one's on. Um, utensil preferences? Bruin herbal
[1038.15s -> 1055.85s]  remedy. Insect repellent. Is this a mod? It's in game. All right. Let me, uh, what time do I have
[1055.85s -> 1060.17s]  to go? I love how it's, uh, okay. I gotta show up Monday morning. Gotta show up for, you know,
[1060.17s -> 1068.42s]  I'm a scout for, uh, for the Horde. All right. So I need charisma. I already have enough. Logic
[1068.42s -> 1076.84s]  level two. Wellness level one. This interior design's awful. It's all right. It's gonna be
[1076.84s -> 1090.84s]  fine. So I need to do cooking. Can you practice cooking or do you just have to cook? Like just
[1090.84s -> 1097.53s]  cook, right? Let's make, um, oh, I learned how to make this. All right. Let's make a single serving
[1097.53s -> 1123.34s]  of this. That sounds good. Why are you coming over? What? And he's got worms? What's happening?
[1127.08s -> 1136.09s]  Oh, it's cause this stupid cube is up here. Okay. All right. That's better.
[1136.57s -> 1147.99s]  Resume. Turn the volume up. How did it turn down? That's what I have to ask.
[1148.71s -> 1160.52s]  How did the volume go get turned down so much? All right. So I need three cooking skill. I can
[1160.52s -> 1168.62s]  do that. A little too much powder. A little too much. How many gallons of milk do you think you
[1168.62s -> 1171.98s]  could chug? I wouldn't do that. That's like kind of awful for you. It's really bad for you.
[1176.78s -> 1191.11s]  This counter. Oh, okay. All right. Very good. Looks good. Looks pretty tasty. Uh,
[1191.91s -> 1202.66s]  I'm not clicking that. It's too early. It's been 10 minutes. I'm up poisoning. Why would I poison
[1202.66s -> 1230.33s]  the food I'm about to eat? I need to save this before something happens. Twerk. What's the crabby?
[1230.33s -> 1235.69s]  Okay. I'm going to honest that he now he's really confident. All right. Uh, I'm going to accidentally
[1235.69s -> 1245.54s]  poison this because it's right above put away. I'm going to click put away, but my brain's going to
[1245.54s -> 1257.21s]  click poison and it's going to, it's going to be bad. Okay. I need to cook again. Should I bake?
[1257.21s -> 1263.66s]  No, that's a different thing, right? All right. How about a, uh, hamburger cake? That's stupid.
[1264.70s -> 1300.95s]  What was that? I didn't click. What are you doing? What is he doing? What is he doing? Free style?
[1300.95s -> 1321.51s]  That was fun. Okay. I don't understand that. I don't know why they even program that. Why do
[1321.51s -> 1326.31s]  they program that into the game? I want you to ask yourself the question. What was the last time
[1327.19s -> 1350.65s]  stop fucking make the food? What was the last time you guys went an inch? Did you put it in a pan?
[1350.65s -> 1354.25s]  When did you, I last time you guys went a half inch away from food you were cooking and went
[1356.70s -> 1363.90s]  no, this is, it happens way too often. It happens way, way too often. And you know what's really
[1363.90s -> 1376.74s]  funny about this? He's going to get to level 10 dancing. Warchief. But do you, when do you stop
[1376.74s -> 1400.95s]  doing that? I think I'm just going to let him go. Warchief material. God. Okay. I kind of do this
[1400.95s -> 1407.38s]  shit though. I've already talked about this. There's been so many times that I've been about
[1407.38s -> 1421.18s]  to eat food or eating food. I'll take a bite and come over and just do one of these. Okay. Same,
[1421.18s -> 1426.74s]  right? Yeah. When was the last time you just, sometimes I don't like sitting and eating.
[1426.74s -> 1433.80s]  Sitting and eating kind of is annoying to me sometimes. I like standing and eating. Is that
[1433.80s -> 1439.54s]  weird? Kind of walking around and taking a bite out of something and just kind of putting it down,
[1439.54s -> 1444.92s]  like doing a couple, a couple of weird like steps like this. Putting my back against the wall,
[1444.92s -> 1450.07s]  being like forward and then take another bite. I don't, I kind of do that. I don't do it that
[1450.07s -> 1453.19s]  often. Okay. Look, people that are like, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't do this every
[1453.19s -> 1459.99s]  single time I eat food. I do this like once every like month. I do it like once a month.
[1461.94s -> 1470.39s]  You're wicked annoying. Okay. If I, if, if I invite friends over and we're going to have dinner,
[1470.39s -> 1475.37s]  I'm not going to be like doing this stuff. But what do you know? That's the only one I'm just
[1475.37s -> 1481.43s]  like, I'm happy because the food's good. Depends on the food. Yeah. I don't say if I eat like a,
[1481.43s -> 1484.63s]  like a gross spaghetti or something and it's like, oh, this is like kind of under cooked
[1484.63s -> 1490.26s]  and tastes awful. I'm not going to be like, oh, why would I do that? It has to be very good.
[1490.26s -> 1506.79s]  How long am I going to wait? Is the food done? Did I even turn the oven on? I don't think the
[1506.79s -> 1535.22s]  oven's on. All right. That's enough. Is it still in there? Oh, it's perfect. Wow. It's excellent
[1535.22s -> 1545.56s]  quality. Who the fuck is this? Who is, who, who is this? Why is this person here?
[1554.97s -> 1556.57s]  You mad that you're, why are you here?
[1556.57s -> 1571.48s]  You're stepping it again.
[1574.20s -> 1588.14s]  What's this? Hey, get out of here. That's just, this person's a fucking vampire or something.
[1588.22s -> 1600.84s]  This person's a werewolf. Oh shit. They're going to turn. Are they turning? I don't know.
[1607.91s -> 1618.38s]  Is this person turning? Why did they growl at me? They knocked on my. Oh my God. Oh my God. Get
[1619.02s -> 1627.00s]  out. I gotta get the weapon. Get out of here. Get out. Get out. Get out. Oh no, no, no, no. I have to.
[1628.20s -> 1649.24s]  Get out of here. This person was going to kill me. This person was going to attack me. How do I get
[1649.24s -> 1659.05s]  this? What do I do? Oh, okay. I got to relax, man. I have to relax. What was the point? Honestly,
[1659.05s -> 1666.04s]  what the fuck was that? This person knocks on my door, steps in shit outside on my porch,
[1666.60s -> 1672.44s]  growls at me, starts to turn into a specter and then starts yelling at my dog. I'm sorry. You're
[1672.44s -> 1676.01s]  going to get fucking Metal Gear Solid. I'm sorry. You're not going to turn into like a vampire and
[1676.01s -> 1679.21s]  start screaming at me in my house. I'm going to bring out the Metal Gear Solid technique.
[1679.93s -> 1702.78s]  I'm sorry. That was fucking scary. Wait, I can demand 47. Yeah, that was scary. It took 27 minutes
[1702.78s -> 1710.23s]  for you to kill somebody. I am sorry. I did. I don't know what these mods activate. For all I know,
[1710.79s -> 1714.87s]  that person could have been here to kill me. I don't know. These mods are out of control. I
[1714.87s -> 1732.54s]  don't know what's going to happen here. What are you doing? Oh, you like the dog. Okay.
[1742.86s -> 1748.54s]  Yeah, also Grump Clump was helped find all these mods. So some of them are really funny. This
[1748.54s -> 1762.31s]  War Chief mod, I can't wait. Excellent. How do I get rid of this? Laugh? I don't know if I want
[1762.31s -> 1780.87s]  to do that. Why is the Grim Reaper still here? Discuss dance techniques. Murderer.
[1792.38s -> 1799.43s]  What are you doing? I am on alert right now because I don't know if he's going to just attack me with
[1799.43s -> 1808.22s]  that side. I need to give my dog- I need to relax after what just happened after being-
[1810.06s -> 1814.78s]  Hey, you want some burger cake? I'm kind of hungry.
[1840.10s -> 1850.74s]  I get rejected? I'm flattered, but I'm not interested in that type of relationship with
[1850.74s -> 1854.74s]  you, but I would be happy if you would like to be friends. Okay. Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing
[1854.74s -> 1863.56s]  from you very soon regardless because the nature of me being attacked. That was weird. Does anyone-
[1863.56s -> 1870.28s]  What was that actually? Was that person a monster with a wizard? What was going on there? Why were
[1870.28s -> 1881.86s]  they growling at me? Did I invite them into the house? And that was a vampire. Okay. So did me
[1881.86s -> 1891.08s]  inviting that person into the house cause me danger? They were just doing vampire stuff.
[1891.08s -> 1895.64s]  Growling at a new neighbor coming into the house. What are you doing? What are you doing?
[1896.52s -> 1929.74s]  Okay. Let's get back to normal here. I didn't even- Stop! What are you doing?
[1932.74s -> 1943.06s]  I am not telling him to do that. Don't you dare. I don't want this to be on the floor.
[1943.06s -> 1948.66s]  It's- You've corrupted- No! I thought I was- I'm gonna get fucking bit by a vampire.
[1951.42s -> 1961.30s]  Wait, I can cook a food for the dog? Cook homestyle pet recipe. What? That's kind of cute.
[1961.30s -> 1980.89s]  How about beef and chicken fish cake? Oh, I don't have any fish. Do I? I don't. Huh?
[1983.61s -> 1994.34s]  What? I knew I shouldn't have fucking installed these goddamn mods. I knew it's been 30 minutes
[1994.34s -> 2008.49s]  and I can't stop. I have to- I can't play The Sims. I can't. I don't- I don't have any fish.
[2008.49s -> 2014.81s]  So just- Don't throw it away. Can I just repurpose this? It's not even out of the package yet.
[2014.81s -> 2026.38s]  And I do- Am I really gonna do this? Are you serious? That was 20 bucks. I have to tweet
[2026.38s -> 2086.90s]  the stream. Give me one second. I'm gonna- I have to tweet the stream. Two seconds. Okay. Tweeting
[2086.90s -> 2111.22s]  it. How does- I always forget to do this. Sims 4 with mods. Come chill. That's all right. It's
[2111.22s -> 2123.45s]  still in my head. It's still getting me. Okay. We are officially tweeted. Oh, by the way,
[2123.45s -> 2131.70s]  I have some good news. I tested negative for COVID this afternoon. So I'm gonna test again
[2131.70s -> 2140.94s]  later tonight. And I hope I'm good to go. There is one problem that I have to go to the doctor about.
[2140.94s -> 2150.46s]  I- My like stomach is kind of messed up, but we'll see. But I'm pretty good to go. Negative.
[2150.46s -> 2156.76s]  That's good at least. I got my sense of taste and smell back. So I'm happy about that. And let's go.
[2159.37s -> 2166.02s]  Okay. So I- What do I need for the Warchief? I need wellness level one. What's wrong? Let's play.
[2166.02s -> 2175.19s]  Let's get a bath and let's play. I have to work today? I have to work in three hours. Oh, shit.
[2175.19s -> 2192.79s]  Put ice where I am going to delete this character if you do that again. Give the dog a bath. What
[2192.79s -> 2198.97s]  are you doing? No. Like, what are you doing? Like, seriously? I don't like the way you were just
[2198.97s -> 2219.51s]  sitting there. Give bath. Let's go. All right. Here we go. Bath time. I kind of smell. I wash my hands.
[2219.51s -> 2227.59s]  What are you doing in the top left corner? Trying to not be in the way of information
[2227.59s -> 2239.70s]  that's important for you to enjoy watching a Sims playthrough. The water is too hot.
[2239.70s -> 2249.45s]  I- I can't adjust the temperature. No, I think he's all right. Is the audio desynced?
[2250.09s -> 2253.61s]  I don't get it. Are people just gaslighting me?
[2253.61s -> 2276.30s]  Okay, cool. All right. So now let's, um, I would do this too after giving Otto a bath. You know
[2276.30s -> 2283.22s]  what I mean? Like, why not? That's an achievement, right? That's like a let's- this is celebratory.
[2283.22s -> 2291.34s]  Where's the dog? I just gave you a bath. Don't come out here and get all dirty.
[2292.65s -> 2303.58s]  You just got a bath and you're all wet. All right. Stop doing the Fortnite thing.
[2305.37s -> 2312.63s]  All right. So let's, uh, work for Blarg starts in an hour. All right. Let's, um,
[2312.63s -> 2324.15s]  here. Come here. Give me a hug. What did I just do? There we go.
[2328.50s -> 2336.71s]  Okay. I do need to take a shower though. Take a quick shower. Yep. I didn't quite get all the
[2336.71s -> 2344.31s]  things I need. When is the work? When do I have to leave for work now? Or in like 30 minutes?
[2344.31s -> 2351.96s]  Just shit my pants. Right when I got new clothes on. I took a shower, put my clothes on, and then
[2351.96s -> 2372.17s]  shit my pants. Am I going to bed? You think you- it's right there. It's literally right here.
[2372.17s -> 2393.46s]  Okay. I gotta go to work. Get up. Time to go to work. When does work start? What? Did I miss work?
[2393.46s -> 2401.78s]  Did I miss- how did I miss work? It said one hour. Oh no, I missed my first day of being a scout for
[2401.78s -> 2427.96s]  the horde. I slept through it. Does that actually mess with hygiene? Or is it just weird and gross?
[2427.96s -> 2434.15s]  Okay. Well, I'm gonna- then I'm spending today working on skills then. I need- oh, I have to
[2434.15s -> 2439.70s]  change this aspiration because I don't want to do this. Whatever. It's fine. He can be a
[2439.70s -> 2447.13s]  war chief Jedi. That's fine. All right. I need logic level two and wellness. What is wellness?
[2448.65s -> 2468.68s]  Wellness? How do I do work? Is it exercise? If I do stretches, does that count? What is this bar
[2468.68s -> 2479.51s]  filling? Over and over it'll tell you. Reading books on wellness, yoga, meditating, and giving
[2479.51s -> 2496.71s]  massages. I didn't flush the toilet when I used it? Ex- what? I need to buy a yoga mat. Okay.
[2496.71s -> 2520.33s]  How much is this? $125? Excuse me? Instructor's yoga mat? How much is this one? What, I can have
[2520.33s -> 2531.77s]  like yoga classes on the beach? Let's go. I need chess for logic. I don't think I have enough money
[2531.77s -> 2562.14s]  for it. Oh, fuck. How much is a yoga instructor? Just let me know what routine interests you and
[2562.14s -> 2572.49s]  we can get started. All right. Um, ask to start yoga class. Brain boosting? What should I do?
[2573.70s -> 2580.15s]  Energy centering? Family? How about brain booster? I'm gonna do a brain boosting yoga routine.
[2580.79s -> 2611.88s]  This dog. Wait, phone. Oh shit, I gotta go to work. Uh oh. Thral is calling me. Where are you?
[2613.06s -> 2633.78s]  You're supposed to be here. 40 minutes ago. Hmm. We're gonna start? Are you gonna start the routine
[2633.78s -> 2654.82s]  or what? Oh, here we go. How much was this? $110? Am I gonna even get one skill point for this?
[2654.82s -> 2683.91s]  Like a mail? I have 78 bucks and I owe $650? Fuck, I can't. God damn it. I need to cut this
[2683.91s -> 2694.28s]  short. It was a hundred. Ah, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
[2694.28s -> 2724.02s]  She went to sleep. What? Okay. I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. Brain boosted.
[2724.02s -> 2730.52s]  I need, I just need a regular yoga mat. Can we do any, can we like do any more
[2731.08s -> 2740.09s]  yoga routines or are you just gonna stand here? By the way, I ghosted Thral. Oh wait,

[2746.82s -> 2759.08s]  Go. Go. Go. Go to work. Go to work. I can still go. Go. I can't go to work.
[2762.98s -> 2783.62s]  I'm gonna take a bubble bath. Bottom right button. I can't. Yeah, it's too late. I can't.
[2783.62s -> 2802.34s]  Am I gonna get fired? I'm not gonna get fired, right? Oh, I did get it. Okay. I got level one
[2802.34s -> 2810.25s]  wellness. So now I need level two logic, which I'm gonna sell a yoga mat. Thanks for coming.
[2816.22s -> 2829.82s]  And I need to buy a, where are you going? Okay. I need to buy a logic chest table.
[2829.82s -> 2841.13s]  I just searched. Okay. Here we go. $450. What can I sell? What can I just get rid of?
[2841.77s -> 2870.25s]  I can do it on a computer. I can? What? I don't know you could do that. Play game. Career.
[2870.25s -> 2885.88s]  Oh no. Right. Is it play game? Play game. Play lick block. It's probably lick block, right?
[2893.70s -> 2910.84s]  Is this doing it? Is this logic? I hate Tetris. I'm just so bad at it.
[2913.75s -> 2920.81s]  So what am I leveling up the gamer skill? It's just video gamer skill. That's probably important
[2920.81s -> 2934.94s]  for being for war chief, right? I need to be pretty good. Wow. I need to research a lot. Wait,
[2934.94s -> 2939.58s]  can I just get a bookshelf? How much is a bookcase? I can do all, I can do cooking. I
[2939.58s -> 2954.90s]  can do logic. Like a bookcase, right? That's how you do it. Here we go. Right? Vintage books.
[2959.50s -> 2980.04s]  This counts, right? There. I don't care. Let's put this here. Read. Which one of these is
[2985.82s -> 2997.93s]  Lord of the Rings? Purchase books. Read something. You have to buy the logic books. What?
[3002.50s -> 3013.40s]  Okay. So I need to show logic. Purchase books and get logic volume one. Is that in here?
[3014.04s -> 3029.38s]  Oh, acting. Okay. I see. It's alphabetical. Logic volume one. $75. God damn it. All right.
[3029.38s -> 3046.62s]  Enough. No more video games. Do your homework. All right. Let's go. When does it work? Okay. I
[3046.62s -> 3053.53s]  got a skill in logic. I need another point. Did I just wait? Did I, do I have like a mod that's
[3053.53s -> 3068.02s]  giving me like hyper skill points? That was immediate. I don't think I do. Do I? You just
[3068.02s -> 3079.00s]  start at level one. Oh, okay. What's wrong? All right. Work is in, oh, I'm supposed to be there
[3079.00s -> 3082.52s]  right now. No, I'm like sitting there. Wait, when do I have to go to work? Okay. So I got,

[3090.17s -> 3111.10s]  Here, let me play. Let's play fetch. Go get it. Get it. I just like a flash of memory was that
[3111.10s -> 3128.01s]  when the vampire stepped outside the house. So I can train the dog more. I think I'm doing
[3128.01s -> 3137.82s]  like a training skill. That's cool. Oh, you're having fun. All right. What level, what level is
[3137.82s -> 3157.67s]  this now? All right. Completed already. I got pretty good at this. The urn is still in your
[3157.67s -> 3164.76s]  inventory. It's always a lot of weird shit by the way. Why is there poop in my pants?
[3165.40s -> 3179.91s]  What is going on? What is this stuff? Oh shit. I can sell all the Star Wars memorabilia.
[3180.47s -> 3195.88s]  I can sell all the Star Wars memorabilia. Wow. I'm going to be just fine. Can I not? What is this
[3195.88s -> 3201.14s]  suit? What is this chair? What is this chair? And why am I not using it instead of this piece of crap?
[3201.86s -> 3208.94s]  You have to place them first. Oh, I'm going to sell all my Star Wars memorabilia. I don't care.
[3209.58s -> 3216.33s]  This is perfect. Okay. What do we got here? Hamburger cake. That's pretty cool. An old coffee,
[3216.97s -> 3231.90s]  two apples. Shit. What is that? Okay. Stop. No more, no more fetch. I know you're getting tired,
[3231.90s -> 3236.26s]  but we have, we got to sell some of our memorabilia. Oh, fine. Just go to bed. We'll do
[3236.26s -> 3262.60s]  this tomorrow morning. Drag and drop the items. What is this? Oh, the Holocron. This is good. I'm
[3262.60s -> 3266.55s]  going to be able to sell this for like a thousand bucks. Look at all this stuff. I'm going to make
[3266.55s -> 3278.22s]  so much money. Kyber crystals. Are you serious? I don't want to sell the ones I like though.
[3278.22s -> 3306.54s]  This BB-8 replica. What is this? Scrap metal? Sell it. All of it. Read. What? Okay. How much is
[3306.54s -> 3315.10s]  this like high fighter replica? A hundred bucks. I want to keep it. Okay. The Holocron is $325.
[3315.10s -> 3332.50s]  Fuck this thing. I, but that's a Luke. Missing out on dreams. It's all right. I don't want to
[3332.50s -> 3341.08s]  get rid of the purple one. I want the red. I want, but this is, um, no, I'm, I'm keeping these.
[3341.08s -> 3367.90s]  Was that a pie? Did my guy get bigger? You have the worst trade in the whole game,
[3367.90s -> 3383.32s]  which is what the, I want to be a Star Wars fan. Okay. So Sith Holocron. Cool. I'm going to,
[3383.32s -> 3389.94s]  I got to, don't put that there. I'm trying to do this. Where did that just go? You idiot. Get
[3389.94s -> 3401.03s]  rid of this. I'll sell a bunch of this shit and then I got to pay my bills. This is not important,
[3401.03s -> 3420.90s]  right? Reddit gold mine. Now I can buy the chess table. They are very important. Oh,
[3420.90s -> 3429.62s]  what about my poster? Only a hundred bucks. Oh, I don't want this anyways. Actually, what is this
[3429.62s -> 3433.19s]  one? I'll keep that one here because does that mean, wait, I'm going to probably going to get
[3433.19s -> 3439.98s]  like a for the horde pose. Wait, I'm going to pretend that's a for the horde. What is this?
[3439.98s -> 3460.10s]  Pile of presents? Or dollars? Comm link? What is this? Can I use it? No, what's the point of
[3460.34s -> 3475.14s]  this? Who's the dog barking at? Oh, uh, I'm going to keep selling shit. What am I ever going to use
[3475.14s -> 3483.29s]  this for? Okay. We got, I'm going to keep the Kyber crystals. Who's buying the shit for $1.
[3483.29s -> 3488.42s]  I'm going to keep the apples because it's, I don't know. It's kind of cool. I'm going to put the Sith
[3488.42s -> 3516.41s]  Holocron out here because it's cool. First order uniform. I'm not selling that. A blaster right.
[3516.41s -> 3530.01s]  Oh, a cool plaque. All right. I got enough money.
[3530.01s -> 3545.82s]  Okay. So now I got to pay my bills. Where's my mailbox? Okay. Here, right here.
[3545.82s -> 3559.67s]  655 bucks. And then I got to make a, uh, logic table. Am I texting?
[3559.67s -> 3582.79s]  Oh, this is what we all were waiting for. It's finally here.
[3585.85s -> 3593.43s]  And I'm not even happy about it. I got all this stuff, but I've got like this $2,000 lightsaber,
[3593.43s -> 3603.98s]  this $5,000 AR training unit, an authentic signed first order costume. And I don't care.
[3605.58s -> 3611.19s]  Isn't this what I want? I thought I wanted this.
[3624.66s -> 3630.50s]  You can now discuss workout techniques. What? Oh, this is not me training to be a Jedi. It's
[3630.50s -> 3649.43s]  just me exercising. I thought I was training to be a Jedi master. That's not what this was.
[3649.43s -> 3664.01s]  Okay. Well, I got money. Jedi aren't real. What's, how do I fix this? Oh yeah. I made it.
[3664.01s -> 3672.38s]  He like hates like scoop and stuff. All right. Empty the trash, fill up the bowl and clean this
[3672.38s -> 3676.94s]  up. Clean up. Cause I got to get to work tomorrow. One more law. I got to read the book, right? What
[3676.94s -> 3683.08s]  time is it? 37 minutes. I have to start working. Why was I out here swinging a lightsaber on like
[3683.08s -> 3722.86s]  a fucking dickhead? Why? Oh my God. Okay. 37 minutes. God damn it. Don't go to bed.
[3724.81s -> 3731.93s]  What are you doing? That was so weird. It's time to go to work. That was weird. He went
[3731.93s -> 3740.81s]  under the cover. I need to be in my work outfit. All right. Go to work. Work starts right now.
[3740.81s -> 3764.81s]  Go to work. What? How do I go to work? How do I go to work? What's happening? It's not there.
[3765.29s -> 3771.19s]  Go to, no, don't eat anymore. Okay. Go to work. It's time for work. I have to go to work. I don't
[3771.19s -> 3790.39s]  want to get fired. How do I, how do I go to work? The mods broken. Oh, the mod seems to be broken.
[3790.39s -> 3800.28s]  Oh, that's unfortunate. So I got to change jobs? Oh no. We can't be a war chief. Yeah. This mod
[3800.28s -> 3808.01s]  hasn't been updated. I don't think in like three years or four years or something. That's funny.
[3808.01s -> 3819.27s]  Although let's try one more day. I'm going to try going one more time. All right. But what if
[3819.59s -> 3870.54s]  calls me? Do I answer? Are we communicating? All right. I need to be ready. What's the issue
[3870.54s -> 3900.30s]  with it right now? I can't go to work. What are you doing? You have to clean this up. The geek con
[3900.30s -> 3909.72s]  isn't, oh, I'm dressed for the occasion right now. I'm going to bring my lightsaber. I'm going to
[3909.72s -> 3915.56s]  bring my holocron. I'm going to, it's good. I'm ready. I've been waiting for this. I am ready to
[3915.56s -> 3933.96s]  go to geek con. I am going to just stand in the middle of this place and just do lightsaber
[3933.96s -> 3941.26s]  practice. And people are going to be like, holy shit, that guy is the man. What are you doing?
[3941.26s -> 3957.67s]  He's supposed to be in your outfit. Are you, what? Put it on. Okay. So this is geek con.
[3967.46s -> 3984.06s]  What was that? They just launched a rocket. Explore space. Uh, yeah, I think so. Where am I?
[4000.36s -> 4013.53s]  He's very angry. Hold on. I got to do this. Yes. No, come on. You're in front of a lot of people.
[4014.49s -> 4044.12s]  You have blown it so bad. So bad. What is this? Like VR stations? Why am I so angry? This is like,
[4044.12s -> 4055.50s]  I've, I want to be here so bad. The geek con challenges have begun. Head to the computers
[4055.50s -> 4060.06s]  to test your programming skills in hackathon or use the motion gaming to test. I don't have any
[4060.06s -> 4072.15s]  gaming skills. Where are they going? Oh, I got to, I got to test my gaming skills. Ultimate gaming
[4072.23s -> 4084.15s]  test. Let's go. Wait, wait, I'll do that later. I can upgrade the ship.
[4094.87s -> 4106.95s]  $500 on this. What, what just happened? That was 500 bucks. That was a shitty ride at a theme park.
[4106.95s -> 4115.91s]  No, I, this is taking role playing to a whole new level here. I'm actually installing better
[4115.91s -> 4128.90s]  rockets on this landing stabilizers. I canceled it. Okay. I'm going to upgrade this thing.
[4128.90s -> 4138.62s]  This guy, this guy shouldn't be here. They, they, they need to put like tape here. You know what I
[4138.62s -> 4146.10s]  mean? Like, otherwise I'm not supposed to be doing this rocket science. I'm leveling up a rocket
[4146.10s -> 4150.92s]  science skill. I'm not leaving. I'm doing this for like the next five minutes. How am I aware?
[4150.92s -> 4165.66s]  Am I going to level up rocket science? Santa, Santa's here. He's joining the hackathon.
[4172.18s -> 4192.04s]  This is so stupid. What's wrong? Stop, dude. Okay. Wait, is Santa going on a trip?
[4196.33s -> 4200.25s]  By the way, I don't think anybody can get on this. If I'm doing this,
[4200.25s -> 4210.94s]  people wait. I, they can't get in here. I'm currently working on it. He is waiting in line
[4210.94s -> 4232.97s]  to do this. I don't work here. Why are people letting me do this? Oh, this is,
[4232.97s -> 4238.55s]  this is celebrity. Santa just got an autograph. I know you want to get on the ship really badly,
[4238.55s -> 4282.20s]  but that's not happening. Okay. How long can I do this for level three rocket science? I'm not
[4282.20s -> 4289.99s]  leaving until I get to level five rocket science. Hackathon has come to an end. First place received
[4289.99s -> 4299.70s]  the, oh, you get a computer. 75% done. I'm doing, I'll install something else. Oh no, no, I'm getting
[4299.70s -> 4318.71s]  on this. I'm going to make sure I'm in the line first. Oh, okay. I did it. I can't. No, no, no.
[4318.71s -> 4328.31s]  I want to go now. It's my turn. I had to explore space. I upgraded this thing.
[4328.31s -> 4351.75s]  What?
[4351.75s -> 4357.51s]  Lorg doesn't remember much, but thinks he may have been abducted. He now stands in a small sterile
[4357.51s -> 4365.18s]  arena. A modely assemblage of hideous beings sits furtively in the bleachers. Slowly a pedestal
[4365.18s -> 4371.14s]  rises from the floor. It contains two items, a ball and a container with two holes, one round
[4371.14s -> 4379.08s]  and one triangular. The room is tense with excitement. I mean, I'm going to, I'm going to
[4379.08s -> 4387.02s]  put it into, I'm going to put it into the round hole. That's what, that's what I would do.
[4396.76s -> 4403.38s]  The festival is going to end before I come back to earth. The round ball definitely slides into
[4403.38s -> 4409.58s]  the round hole and the room erupts into ferocious applause. Lorg instinctively bows graciously as
[4409.58s -> 4415.98s]  the puzzle recedes back to the floor, replaced by a new one. This next rising pedestal has a hat.
[4415.98s -> 4429.96s]  Yes, it's a very fine hat, perhaps a derby. What should Lorg do? Wear the hat. It's over in like
[4429.96s -> 4442.52s]  20 minutes. Am I going to get stuck in outer space? Eureka! The hat goes on the head. More
[4442.52s -> 4447.88s]  cheer is spewed forth from the crowd as Lorg rifles the hat into the stands with a flourish.
[4447.88s -> 4452.04s]  To be caught by one lucky fan, the hatless pedestal sinks and disappears into the ground
[4452.04s -> 4457.48s]  and is shortly replaced again. This latest test pedestal appears to hold a chair, a simple metal
[4457.48s -> 4467.26s]  chair. All right, I think we're going to go, we're going to sit next to the chair because they're
[4467.26s -> 4471.82s]  definitely doing this thing where it's like, oh, put the hat on, put the circle into the circle,
[4471.82s -> 4492.17s]  sit in the, dead, right? I'm going to sit next to the chair. No, you ruined it. What? Lorg is too
[4492.17s -> 4497.93s]  smart for them. That chair is one of those moving platforms. As the crowd applauds Lorg's wisdom
[4497.93s -> 4505.11s]  and foresight, thank you everybody. Please have a seat. The chair sinks down into the dark recesses
[4505.11s -> 4511.58s]  in the floor, replaced by the next challenge. This pedestal is made of solid gold and contains
[4511.58s -> 4530.31s]  valuable looking jewels. I don't think I touched these, but wait, what if it's a shitload of money?
[4530.31s -> 4540.34s]  I could actually just take it. I might, I need the money, but it could be a trick.
[4540.34s -> 4550.74s]  Thrall would want you to take it. Don't be greedy. Greed is good. Don't do it.
[4555.45s -> 4562.68s]  Okay. On one end, this is morality, right? No, I know that you're tempting me with riches. I don't
[4562.68s -> 4567.72s]  want them. It's going to be, this is morality, right? But on the other hand, I could make like
[4567.72s -> 4588.09s]  10 grand. Are they testing morality? Another trick, Lorg thinks as the gems glitter and sparkle.
[4589.05s -> 4592.41s]  Then the alien beings look at each other in confusion. Does he not know the value of what
[4592.41s -> 4604.18s]  is presented? A buzzer unmistakably indicates failure. Bring me back. I want to take the jewels.
[4604.18s -> 4607.14s]  I want to go back. I'm going back to space. Bring it back. I'm going back in.
[4607.14s -> 4611.38s]  I'm going back to space. I'm going back. See you later. It was nice to see everybody. I'm going
[4611.38s -> 4633.54s]  back up there and I'm going to take the jewels this time. I'm going back up. What? Passing the
[4633.54s -> 4640.36s]  planet Yang, Lorg sees a weary looking alien standing amid a huge pile of trash bags and rusty
[4640.36s -> 4647.61s]  futon parts. He's moving to a new pad on the planet Rompeter and his friend who was supposed
[4647.61s -> 4656.73s]  to help just bailed. Lorg's got some extra time. Should he pitch in? There's no no. Sure. You can't,
[4657.53s -> 4672.06s]  no. Is there enough time to get one of these funny hot dogs? What's wrong? Good thing Lorg
[4672.06s -> 4678.95s]  has an expanded cargo bay from being a Jedi. It's a lot of stuff to move. Old concert tees,
[4678.95s -> 4684.20s]  milk tray furniture, but it all fits in pretty easily and they blast off for Rompeter. The alien
[4684.20s -> 4689.32s]  is so grateful he gives Lorg his least dirty futon mattress as thanks. Lorg incinerates it.
[4689.32s -> 4729.19s]  I want a- lost in a nebula. Lorg instruments go haywire and his rocket ship is bathed in purple
[4729.19s -> 4733.99s]  light. Purple and gold dust coats the sky as far as the eye can see which isn't that far. He must
[4733.99s -> 4738.31s]  have drifted into a giant nebula. Lorg can send out a call for help or forge ahead and hope the
[4738.31s -> 4762.82s]  instruments can sort it out. Forge forward. I just got rocket science. Lorg wanders through the cloud
[4762.82s -> 4770.52s]  the dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic. An exquisite dream or luxurious grave. What?
[4770.84s -> 4777.74s]  He is at peace with the beauty of his lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into
[4777.74s -> 4784.39s]  the clear. He's free. He just needs a little more luck. He's got to get home on fumes. Am I going to
[4784.39s -> 4833.38s]  die up here? Oh shit! I made it! Okay, we're good. Okay, I- is the convention's over?
[4834.34s -> 4851.99s]  The convention ended already. I gotta go home. Do you have a bathroom? Where's the dog? I hear a dog.
[4884.06s -> 4891.18s]  This dude- this dude comes back from a bunch of alien travel. He's so exhausted.
[4891.26s -> 4897.50s]  Comes home, sits down in a chair, and just shits his pants. Oh my god.
[4902.47s -> 4911.18s]  This guy is exhausted. He is so tired. Oh, I feel so bad.
[4911.34s -> 4918.55s]  On an adventure. He's asleep.
[4922.55s -> 4929.91s]  Dude, the guy in the first order costume shits his pants. I don't know who we call about this.
[4929.91s -> 4936.63s]  Who do we talk to about this? Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I think the guy in the Sith outfit,
[4936.63s -> 4950.49s]  he's in there sitting down. I think he shits his pants. Oh, do we call security? I'm just in- I'm
[4950.49s -> 4964.87s]  in REM sleep right now. Oh my goodness. What? It's karaoke night? Oh my goodness.
[4973.98s -> 4983.45s]  I'm starting to lose control, I think. What? Honestly, what was that?
[4999.16s -> 5016.79s]  I'm curious how this plays out. Let's just see what happens. I have to be careful taking a sip
[5016.79s -> 5067.08s]  of this. I'm gonna choke on this. Oh, he knows he's in it. He's sitting in it. Use the bathroom.
[5068.38s -> 5072.62s]  Yeah, it's called- dude, you gotta throw- you gotta throw all your clothes in the trash,
[5072.62s -> 5075.42s]  you know what I mean? I hope you brought a backpack with a change of clothes.
[5078.66s -> 5090.33s]  Oh my goodness. What is this? It's really decorated in here. That was nice and comfortable,
[5090.33s -> 5096.74s]  and I did a really cool adventure. I explored space. I'm going back to sleep, though.
[5097.91s -> 5099.91s]  I woke up to change my fucking pants.
[5102.98s -> 5129.88s]  Where am I gonna go back to bed? This guy's- this guy's fucking- why don't I just go home?
[5131.00s -> 5142.25s]  No, you know what? It's time to get up. It's time to get up. It's time to sing karaoke.
[5142.89s -> 5149.67s]  This is so loud. I have to turn it down before it gives me a headache.
[5152.12s -> 5156.02s]  I think I'm- I think it's safe for me to save here.
[5157.64s -> 5167.48s]  What are they all saying? Oh, there's a celebrity behind me.
[5174.06s -> 5178.38s]  Celebrity. That's a- that's an absolute proper celebrity.
[5190.90s -> 5203.27s]  Okay. You have to step back. Can I sing?
[5215.98s -> 5229.99s]  I need to go home. Sing? But should I just sing? Oh, dude, hold on.
[5262.98s -> 5268.90s]  Did you just cut the music? Or is she looking at me? She stopped because I'm doing this.
[5269.54s -> 5283.83s]  I don't know what happened. She's stuck. I think she's just confused what I'm doing.
[5285.75s -> 5298.89s]  I'm incredibly distracting. I want to sing. Why can I not sing? Too uncomfortable.
[5304.97s -> 5307.93s]  No, don't go to bed. I want to talk. I want to hang out.
[5307.93s -> 5313.29s]  No. Look, just eat the apples that are in your mouth. Who cares? Eat. Plant.
[5339.30s -> 5345.27s]  Who, Apple, Andy? What am I doing? What is this? Oh my god.
[5345.27s -> 5383.77s]  Let's go wash this in the sink. No, I want to do that. Can I like wash my hands?
[5389.51s -> 5420.98s]  This is a very strange- this is a strange person. I can talk to the toilet. Special effects?
[5425.43s -> 5433.05s]  Oh, I can turn it off and on. That's kind of- whoa. Okay, I gotta go home. It's over. Time to leave.
[5433.77s -> 5442.87s]  That was a fun geek con. It's time to go to bed. I think- I think somebody else shit their pants.
[5442.87s -> 5452.28s]  I don't think it was me. See you later, everybody. Upgrade their toilet. No, I'm gonna pass out.
[5453.16s -> 5463.45s]  I'm gonna fall asleep on the ground. Send him back to space. I don't think I can do that anymore.
[5464.01s -> 5470.89s]  Look, I got rocket science 4 from that. I can make my own rocket.
[5475.43s -> 5488.68s]  That was an adventure. I was out of control. Oh, I got an achievement. Like the sims 4 for 5 hours.
[5490.04s -> 5496.04s]  Okay, that was an eventful day. I have to go to work in 7 hours, so let's make sure I get some
[5496.04s -> 5507.40s]  sleep and take a shower. That's important, number one. And then we're gonna go to bed.
[5507.48s -> 5524.92s]  How do you upgrade a bed? How does that mean? How could I upgrade the bed with a wrench? Oh.
[5529.82s -> 5541.99s]  There we go. All right, I'll get rid of these. Too many sims. We're good. You got food, right?
[5541.99s -> 5548.30s]  How are you doing? Are you good? You want a treat before I go to bed? Here, have a treat before I
[5548.30s -> 5564.39s]  go to bed. You also need this- this dog needs a bath every day. Every single day. Sleep. Feed him.
[5566.68s -> 5576.26s]  All right, it's time to see if I can go to work. What's wrong, you okay? What's the matter? Oh,
[5576.26s -> 5590.50s]  we're good. Two hours. All right, I need to be up. So get up, have some food. What do you got?
[5590.50s -> 5599.93s]  Leftovers. And let's see if I can go to work. What's this so dirty? It's the same dirty,
[5599.93s -> 5619.05s]  spoiled cake I was eating at that restaurant. Okay, it's 8 a.m. Go to work. Oh, I think it's
[5619.05s -> 5630.66s]  broken. It's broken. You can't go to work. Well, looks like I'm going to be a rocket scientist.
[5630.66s -> 5639.69s]  Sorry, Thrall. It was funny. It was fun. Okay. I can do it on the computer, right?
[5639.69s -> 5652.36s]  Career. Find a job. All right. Astronaut. That seems pretty good, right? Is it astronaut or is
[5652.36s -> 5670.58s]  it rocket scientist? Okay. Oh, wait. Scientist. Which one? Which one is it building rockets?
[5670.58s -> 5680.06s]  Scientist or astronaut? Wait, there's a rocket scientist? So I could do- so do scientist because
[5680.06s -> 5689.82s]  rocket scientist is a scientist. Okay. Oh, I could have just read the tag line here. Okay.
[5692.70s -> 5695.98s]  Scientists who proves they've got a gray- the gray matter to change the world as we know it
[5695.98s -> 5704.18s]  can unlock no emphasis. Like the UFO hunter with a chemistry lab. Okay. An astronaut is
[5705.45s -> 5713.69s]  space ranger and interstellar smuggler. This is important. I think we're going to need to
[5713.69s -> 5731.19s]  have to do this with a poll. Astronaut or rocket scientist? You actually get to go to work as a
[5731.19s -> 5746.95s]  scientist. Interesting. Either scientist or astronaut. Which one? Science. Science. Astronaut.
[5753.02s -> 5764.12s]  Okay. Astronaut or scientist? Astro- how do you spell astronaut? I don't know. Scientist.
[5765.64s -> 5775.22s]  Uh, just one minute. Doesn't matter. Oh, two minutes. It's fine. How do you spell astronaut?
[5775.22s -> 5783.77s]  Yeah, I got it right. Okay. Oh, poll's already active. Oops. Hey, don't influence the vote.
[5783.77s -> 5798.95s]  Don't influence. It's just- just ask the question. Well, you guys are being influenced. Sorry about
[5798.95s -> 5819.50s]  that. Okay. So sims in the scientist career are more likely to be abducted. Okay. Satellite dish
[5820.57s -> 5830.22s]  allows you to contact aliens. Okay. I mean, that's cool. I probably would have- I'm- why am I so
[5830.22s -> 5842.28s]  sweaty? I think I was laughing too hard. All right. I mean, that's the way it is. We're doing- we're
[5842.28s -> 5865.53s]  doing scientist. Scientist. All right. I need to have two breakthroughs. I don't know what that
[5865.53s -> 5883.08s]  means. Two breakthroughs? While gardening, reading, or performing experiments. Read? All right. First
[5883.08s -> 5892.57s]  of all, clean up. This is a mess. And I got to work in lifestyle. That was previously hidden.
[5892.57s -> 5914.30s]  View the lifestyle menu. Wait, what? I got single and loving it. All right. So I start work in two
[5914.30s -> 5921.16s]  days. So I have a lot of time. I just got to get my mood up. I got to get focused and I need to have
[5921.16s -> 5928.78s]  a couple of breakthroughs. So how am I doing right now? I'm pretty good. Let's start to read. Read a
[5930.47s -> 5941.53s]  puzzle book or something, right? I should probably do logic again. Where is it? Where's the logic
[5941.53s -> 5952.82s]  book? Should I purchase like- is there a science book? Wait, rocket science volume one. There it is.
[5959.83s -> 5980.86s]  Bingo. All right. Have a couple- have a couple of breakthroughs. You good? Eureka!
[5981.58s -> 5985.74s]  Lord McDulty had his first breakthrough and wrote down an idea for a momentum conserver.
[5985.74s -> 6008.39s]  Click on the notebook button at the top of the phone to learn more about it. Where? Change phone
[6008.39s -> 6027.45s]  background. Silence phone. Change phone cover. Where is it? What's it above the phone? Wait,
[6027.45s -> 6035.26s]  no ingredients required. Can I just make it? No ingredients required. How do I do this?
[6038.50s -> 6045.18s]  Do I need like a science thing? A science table? It's a perpetual motion machine?
[6054.70s -> 6074.26s]  Wait, are perpetual motion machines impossible? They can't exist, right? They don't exist. But
[6074.26s -> 6080.73s]  don't they make these- I feel like I've seen a perpetual motion machine where it's like a ball
[6080.73s -> 6091.32s]  can just keep moving like over and over again. They can work. It's not perfect. Isn't the dog
[6091.32s -> 6102.81s]  at the mall the thing that goes- a perpetual motion machine? Oh no, it needs power. How do
[6102.81s -> 6115.66s]  you make one? All right, I can't keep fucking talking like that. I just asked you guys how to
[6115.66s -> 6121.02s]  make a perpetual motion machine. Something that like science has never figured out over fucking
[6121.02s -> 6137.00s]  a hundred years of scientific research. How do you guys make one? Only a hundred years? More like
[6137.00s -> 6147.37s]  hundreds? Well, you know what I mean. They're inherently not possible. This dog is- this dog is
[6147.37s -> 6158.18s]  fucking filthy all day. Every day. The dog is filthy. I don't know what to do about this. It's
[6158.18s -> 6168.78s]  every single day. Well, because everything needs power to operate, right? So you don't- you can't.
[6168.78s -> 6173.42s]  Because if you have like a battery-operated perpetual motion machine, the bat- you need to
[6173.42s -> 6185.67s]  replace the batteries. Oh, hold on. I'm focused right now. Um, why can't I read that? Is it in my-
[6186.63s -> 6202.73s]  All right, read it. Battery-operated perpetual motion. COVID messed up his head. Here it is.
[6202.73s -> 6209.00s]  Oh, my voice. Okay, so I got what I needed. Two breakthroughs and I need to be focused. I am
[6209.00s -> 6219.14s]  focused. I have to go to work focused. All right, and that is in a while. I know how to make one,
[6219.14s -> 6237.42s]  but I won't tell you. Why not? That's- yeah, that's rude. Okay, so I'm focused. I've done
[6237.42s -> 6245.14s]  some rocket science. I am going to make sure I am fully fulfilled for tomorrow. What's wrong?
[6245.14s -> 6254.86s]  We got- okay, I'm a little sad and amateur hour. You're bored from this book. Oh, all right,
[6254.86s -> 6269.70s]  let me have a little bit of fun. Just like, look, information on vampires or whatever. This is the
[6269.70s -> 6275.88s]  kind of shit that I would just have auto play at YouTube and just, I don't know, just watch like
[6275.88s -> 6288.86s]  fucking 10 videos about it. Dude, I watched- um, Lord realized that fucking golic and plasma can
[6288.86s -> 6296.49s]  be found in Forgotten Hollow. Oh, all right, there's fucking golic in there. Uh, so.
[6306.04s -> 6321.54s]  This dude has a problem. I couldn't even continue what I was going to say. You can
[6321.54s -> 6338.33s]  purchase the vampire book. Okay, well, you had some fun. Cool. I need to eat. Dude, a flavor enhancer?
[6338.33s -> 6345.80s]  I want to do this stuff. How do I get- I want to read a book about being handy because having- this
[6345.80s -> 6374.18s]  is perfect. Wait, repair. That'll help, right? For the dog's sake, dog deserves to be happy. What?
[6374.18s -> 6383.98s]  No cheating. I'm going to give the dog a bath and then play with the dog. Yes, you like being,
[6383.98s -> 6389.51s]  you like being a handy worker. Okay, cool. All right, come over here. Let's have a bath.
[6392.14s -> 6397.72s]  Come with me. You're going to get a big treat and then we're going to play fetch. What happened?
[6403.13s -> 6415.24s]  What are my dreams? You want to be a debate captain? I want to have a nerdy conversation.
[6415.24s -> 6421.19s]  I want to listen to lullabies. I want to get some sleep and be funny in a crowded place.
[6424.68s -> 6435.38s]  Okay, well, I can get this done. How much is just like a little radio? I need a- okay,
[6435.38s -> 6455.40s]  I need a little end table with a radio. Okay, now I need a radio. Just like a little one. Just a
[6455.40s -> 6475.77s]  little one right like this one. This thing's way too big. A cafe wall speaker? Okay, listen to
[6481.03s -> 6499.26s]  lullabies radio. All right, you doing better? Happy? Look happy? Okay, let's fulfill one of your
[6499.26s -> 6535.34s]  dreams. Why does this guy want to listen to the first 15 seconds of every horror movie trailer?
[6537.50s -> 6557.69s]  It's kind of weird. Are you fulfilled? Not quite. Now you want to listen to retro music. Okay,
[6559.90s -> 6590.73s]  next song on this album. Why would you have this album? What happened? Oh my god. All right,
[6590.73s -> 6619.40s]  where's retro? Retro. Go on, listen. If I keep that, is it bad? This is like, I don't know,
[6619.40s -> 6625.70s]  I tell you guys about like when I used to fall asleep. If a DVD was in the DVD player and it
[6625.70s -> 6634.33s]  would just be on the the 25 second song that was at the menu screen for the DVD and falling asleep
[6634.33s -> 6642.86s]  to that was unbearable. You would hear it cycle over and over again and it would wake you up and
[6642.86s -> 6652.58s]  it would piss you off but you wouldn't get up and turn it off. Don't even mention Shrek. Yeah,
[6652.58s -> 6656.42s]  like you would all of a sudden just hear like, oh the years start coming in, they don't stop coming,
[6656.42s -> 6661.62s]  you're stuck and it's like, shut the fuck up. Shut up. But you're just so tired. You just don't
[6661.62s -> 6667.11s]  care. You don't want to get out of bed. You don't want to, where's the remote, right? I remember
[6668.23s -> 6678.49s]  Punisher DVD. The menu of that DVD is, there's a song and it's like, it's a guy with a with an
[6678.49s -> 6687.16s]  acoustic guitar and it's like, they may come back someday to live once more.
[6690.70s -> 6695.10s]  And it would just go, it would happen. Oh, it was 20 seconds of that song. It would play over and
[6695.10s -> 6701.56s]  over and over and over again. And I would just wake up over and over to like the, they may come
[6701.56s -> 6708.68s]  back someday. I'd be like, please God, please. Please, there's a power outage. Please, I'm praying
[6708.68s -> 6715.82s]  for power outage right now because I don't want to do this. Oh shit. Stop it. Stop it. Stop that.
[6715.82s -> 6735.78s]  $378. Where, where am I? I can repair this. This dog is fucking filthy every day.
[6736.66s -> 6750.92s]  This dog needs a bath every six hours. What? Oh, you need to go. Wait, no, stop, stop.
[6753.50s -> 6778.92s]  Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who is this? Who is this? Why is there,
[6780.36s -> 6785.75s]  where did this, where did this trash come from? I can't believe he pissed on this person.
[6785.75s -> 6791.03s]  I can't believe he pissed on him. You, I can't believe that dog just did this.
[6791.03s -> 6796.04s]  You just might, this person walks through the wall. This person might be a scary person.
[6809.75s -> 6819.26s]  Want some coffee? Did I even fix the toilet? I did. Okay. Don't go in the bathroom.
[6823.26s -> 6825.18s]  This is bad if you go in the bathroom.
[6836.73s -> 6842.01s]  Imagine, my eye is freaking out. Imagine going up to your neighbor's house and introducing yourself
[6842.01s -> 6847.13s]  and when you knock on the door, the dog runs out, greets you and just pisses all over you.
[6850.28s -> 6865.08s]  We need to make some friends. What are you doing? Um, let's like gossip. No, I'm about to go.
[6897.59s -> 6904.78s]  What am I up to here?
[6904.78s -> 6909.26s]  Do you have a question?
[6913.43s -> 6914.55s]  You want to listen to music?
[6916.55s -> 6917.51s]  Goof around. Okay.
[6920.63s -> 6929.77s]  I mean, is that what she asked? Did she ask to slow dance?
[6930.25s -> 6957.11s]  Why was that a selection? Why? I, why was that a selection? Laid back shuffle. I'm this,
[6957.11s -> 6961.83s]  he is going through a lot of different emotions right now. I can't get up because she's in the
[6961.83s -> 6968.73s]  way. I can't stand up from the chair. Yes, I can. Okay. Oh, you want to, let's go. Let's go. Let's
[6968.73s -> 7036.65s]  go. This is what you wanted to do. Okay. You want to dance again? Um, I'm doing it. Are you doing it
[7036.65s -> 7061.58s]  too? Was that me? What are you doing on my computer? Do you want me to? No, come dance.
[7062.38s -> 7067.08s]  She's like, I want to dance. I want to dance to music. I want music. Well, come on over here.
[7067.08s -> 7098.68s]  What do you got? Show me what you got. All right. All right. What about that? Stop doing that one.
[7098.68s -> 7102.60s]  Stop doing that. Stop doing that. That was bad. That was that. That's going to, you're going to
[7102.60s -> 7108.25s]  leave. I don't, I didn't, that's, you don't do that one. How about this one?
[7113.53s -> 7121.88s]  Do you not like this one? I feel like both of my arms are being controlled by two different
[7121.88s -> 7145.80s]  people in Gmod. Oh, she's leaving. Well, that was nice to meet you. I maybe we'll see you again.
[7145.80s -> 7170.55s]  What's your name? Minerva? What's your name? Minerva Charm. Okay. All right. I got to clean up.
[7170.55s -> 7178.92s]  It's kind of disgusting. All right. That was fun. That was fun. Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. All right.
[7178.92s -> 7186.50s]  All right. All right. I got to get to bed. I got to work. I got to work in 10 hours. Turn this off.
[7189.78s -> 7219.51s]  Why would you get out of bed to do that? I was lying in bed with the remote in my hand.
[7221.72s -> 7265.96s]  This is YouTuber music. Wait, I can't get up. Holy shit. Okay. Go to bed. You got food, right? You got
[7265.96s -> 7274.65s]  food. Clean up. Clean up all this, please. Scavenge for parts and then pee like a champion and then
[7274.65s -> 7296.50s]  get in bed. Go on. Hurry up. I got two upgrade parts. Oh, whatever. I got to get up anyway soon.
[7296.50s -> 7325.62s]  What's wrong? Oh my God. This algae growing in the sink. Turn the music off. He changes his mind every
[7325.62s -> 7389.50s]  two seconds. Stop. Just get in the bed. You stop shitting your pants. Oh my God. Okay.
[7393.85s -> 7409.38s]  You shit the bed. This person shit the bed. I got to get up and go to work.
[7417.59s -> 7423.02s]  I don't have time. I just got to get up. Trusty notepad in hand. It's time for
[7423.02s -> 7426.22s]  Blorg to go work at the lab. Maybe today is the day for a major breakthrough.
[7426.22s -> 7443.53s]  Here to join them. Yeah. Let's go. Welcome to future sim labs. You'll be quite busy conducting
[7443.53s -> 7447.61s]  essential experiments, researching new technology, and maybe even interacting with alien life.
[7448.17s -> 7452.57s]  It's your job to leverage potent scientific equipment for the purposes of good.
[7452.57s -> 7457.18s]  We hope. Well, welcome. Okay.
[7464.17s -> 7483.35s]  Hold on. I got to turn it up. A little up. Wait, I'm crying in the bathroom? What?
[7483.35s -> 7490.73s]  What?
[7495.21s -> 7501.77s]  I'm sorry, dude, but you can't just listen to kids music.
[7507.10s -> 7507.66s]  What's wrong?
[7507.66s -> 7513.18s]  What's wrong? I got to like meet my coworker.
[7527.13s -> 7528.81s]  Okay. Let's meet our first coworker.
[7537.64s -> 7540.66s]  I'm new. Good to see you.
[7541.22s -> 7542.26s]  Bruce.
[7545.22s -> 7548.26s]  Complain about work. It's my first day.
[7558.12s -> 7561.96s]  Pretend to fire? Why do I have this authority?
[7567.40s -> 7568.52s]  Why would I have this authority?
[7574.90s -> 7582.86s]  Cleave, Tannif, Pazoo, Plyver, Pneve, Clevite, Banu, Fidoy, Bafala.
[7582.86s -> 7586.38s]  So I walked in my first day. Wait, did I just get fired?
[7607.48s -> 7619.08s]  Ask them to wait. Pursue your dream job. What? Like don't work here anymore?
[7619.16s -> 7633.56s]  Sorry, I don't think I know you this well to have this conversation.
[7634.84s -> 7636.36s]  Okay. So how do I clock into work?
[7644.87s -> 7653.24s]  No, no, no, I am not going to joke about coworkers. I'm not going to tell joke.
[7653.72s -> 7657.72s]  What are you doing? All right.
[7659.72s -> 7662.04s]  You're fucking this whole thing up. You're fucking this whole thing up.
[7662.68s -> 7679.38s]  Is there anybody else that works here? Oh, okay. Another coworker. Mix synthetic food serum.
[7682.30s -> 7701.46s]  I don't think I should be using this. No, don't get out from the seat.
[7701.46s -> 7706.54s]  Just talk. Turn your head around. Oh, you're making the food serum. Okay.
[7709.83s -> 7715.02s]  Can I do that? Okay. I need to get to know a coworker.
[7718.15s -> 7730.42s]  Okay. Get to know. Just friendly, just normal conversations. Hey, how's your day?
[7735.43s -> 7743.11s]  Okay. I think I'm being mocked. I can't tell, but it's all right. Let's talk about work.
[7749.77s -> 7758.09s]  Yeah. Is it a roulette table? Okay. All right. Let's talk about
[7760.81s -> 7770.30s]  mock outfit is the same outfit I am wearing. Wait, where am I? Where am I going?
[7794.14s -> 7812.25s]  I'm about to build a rocket. Build it. Where are you? What are you doing?
[7813.05s -> 7817.62s]  This cool music just played and you walked away from it.
[7827.18s -> 7832.10s]  It doesn't get it. It doesn't know how to do it. Okay. So I'm going to do
[7832.82s -> 7846.58s]  synthesize serum. Okay. I need plants. Where do I get plants? Okay. Brainstorm and invention.
[7847.14s -> 7852.86s]  Brainstorm on invention constructor. Okay. I'm too angry to do anything.
[7856.98s -> 7862.20s]  Oh, you guys can't see that. My camera's blocking it. Try move the cam to the top right.
[7862.20s -> 7865.66s]  But I think that blocks in that there's a lot of information that gets blocked.
[7865.66s -> 7870.95s]  I think a lot of information gets blocked no matter where it goes.
[7870.95s -> 7897.67s]  Put it middle left like here. Is that good right there? No. Middle right like here.
[7899.14s -> 7905.94s]  You'll miss info like right here. Maybe right here is good. What do you think? Right there.
[7906.95s -> 7910.31s]  I think that looks all right. There's not important information that's there.
[7917.32s -> 7929.86s]  Let me the brightness is really high on this right now too. Hold on. That's what's making me red.
[7929.86s -> 7943.91s]  I figured it out. It's I had this weird color corrector on. That's why it's doing that.
[7943.91s -> 7964.71s]  Okay. Well, let's fix this. That's better. We're still in 60 fps. All right. We're good.
[7964.71s -> 7973.18s]  All right. I'll save the game. Now, how? What am I supposed to do about this?
[7973.18s -> 7977.58s]  You have a bug. Please fix it. You got to restart to fix it after you apply the fix.
[7977.58s -> 7997.56s]  What? I have the angry bug. The sim is always mean. It's a bug. I'll do it after work.
[7997.56s -> 8010.84s]  Do I have to just restart the game or how do I fix it? Is there a delay on your camera?
[8010.84s -> 8014.92s]  No, there isn't. I don't know. I got to figure out why people are saying that.
[8014.92s -> 8039.86s]  Here we go. I'm doing work. Go to computer. Put on the command center. Okay. There is a tiny delay.
[8041.98s -> 8056.12s]  I'm going to try something here. Just bear with me for one second while I do this.
[8056.12s -> 8064.28s]  Did that fix it? Ready? Like so right now I should be really delayed. I should be very delayed right
[8064.28s -> 8092.31s]  now. That's correct. Now it shouldn't be. It should be fine now. But is it? That's the question.
[8092.39s -> 8101.26s]  Wrong way. Yeah, I don't understand. It's very weird. I wonder if it's something with the camera.
[8101.26s -> 8130.52s]  Let me try one more thing. Did that fix it? Can you guys hear me? Are we good? Is it better?
[8130.52s -> 8136.02s]  There's no delay. You know, I'm going to watch some clips when this is done and see if I can
[8136.02s -> 8144.39s]  recreate what's going on here. Okay. But anyways, yeah, so I have to fix this. I have to go to
[8144.39s -> 8151.75s]  the MC command center and then go to MC tuner and go to interactions and disable mean interactions.
[8151.75s -> 8183.74s]  Really? I'll fix it after this today. Scary. Mean is fun. Oh, okay. Hold on. Here we go.
[8188.95s -> 8197.26s]  Okay. I can brainstorm now. I'm nervous calling me. Hey vlog, I think
[8197.26s -> 8207.66s]  Britanny Cho is pretty cute. Should I ask her out? I don't know who that is. Sure. Go for it. I
[8207.66s -> 8214.44s]  guess. I don't know who that is. Why do people call? Why do people call you to ask you if they
[8214.44s -> 8219.54s]  should go? I don't get that. I've never met that person before. I don't know who that is. I can't
[8219.54s -> 8237.70s]  give you good advice. Oh, hold on. Brainstorming. Okay. Get to know. Experiment on the chemistry
[8237.70s -> 8249.64s]  lab. You done with that? It's almost, I'm almost done with work and I haven't done anything. I
[8249.64s -> 8258.86s]  don't even have half a bar bubble filled. Oh God. Can I even get one filled? What happened? What
[8258.86s -> 8263.82s]  happened? I broke something. What's going, what's it doing? Oh, he's dancing. All right. Stop that.
[8263.82s -> 8288.62s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop. There's an explosion. Oh my God. Stop. He's taste. Nice work. What'd you
[8288.62s -> 8311.86s]  make? This guy's on drugs. Somebody shit their pants over here. I heard it. Somebody shit over
[8311.86s -> 8325.54s]  here. I heard that. Okay. Stop groove jam. You already had one queued up called vibing.
[8325.54s -> 8337.45s]  Could you please vibe your way into finishing your job? Practice analysis. What do I do that?
[8337.45s -> 8360.06s]  Hurry up. Do it. I can't. I got, hold on. Why is everybody minus twoing? What'd I do? What happened?
[8360.06s -> 8368.60s]  Minus two. Oh, I'm hungry. All right. I need to practice analysis. I would have touched in the
[8368.60s -> 8378.84s]  CEO in a meeting because it said like vibe your way over here. I was at, I would have touched CEO.
[8379.56s -> 8385.40s]  All right. You're done with this. Go over this way. I'm never going to work with this guy again.
[8385.40s -> 8406.31s]  Like he can just go. It's too much. It's too much stress. Okay. Almost done with that. Got it.
[8406.31s -> 8412.07s]  All right. I need to get to know a coworker. Can I, can we, I just need to say hello and
[8412.07s -> 8423.48s]  okay. Let's theorize about aliens. Okay. Work ends soon, but I can get one more of these.
[8426.60s -> 8429.32s]  There's no such thing as aliens. I've seen them.
[8429.80s -> 8433.48s]  Yeah. Okay.
[8436.36s -> 8438.92s]  Right. I'm starting your element collection is really show them off.
[8445.22s -> 8447.94s]  Okay. Let's talk about the aliens.
[8451.94s -> 8452.74s]  Aliens don't exist.
[8460.09s -> 8473.98s]  Selium, this is painful. What I, I have to do these. Otherwise I didn't fulfill my tasks at work.
[8473.98s -> 8493.51s]  What am I doing? There is a cafeteria here and I didn't even know it. Whose food is this?
[8503.27s -> 8518.01s]  Why was there food? I only heard $40. I'm not going. I'm not going to work anymore.
[8518.81s -> 8539.19s]  I'm sending him to work. I'm not doing that anymore. Somebody said that dude. That's what
[8539.19s -> 8560.65s]  a babysitter makes. Come on. Babysitter salary. I'm never going to work and get this Star Wars
[8560.65s -> 8566.49s]  shit out of here. Can I change this? Cause it's stupid. A Star Wars isn't stupid. I like Star Wars
[8566.49s -> 8573.77s]  some of it, but I mean, I don't want it to be my complete aspiration of my life to go to the Disney
[8573.77s -> 8578.97s]  world Star Wars park every day. You know what I mean? Like I don't, I need to change this to be
[8578.97s -> 8585.96s]  like build a rocket. I currently just need to go. All right. I just need to go to Batuu and just
[8585.96s -> 8604.71s]  fulfill this. Unless you change it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Right. Right. Um,
[8604.71s -> 8625.40s]  okay. Knowledge. Computer whiz. Nerd brain. What's like aliens or space craft? No, not vampire. It's
[8625.40s -> 8631.48s]  probably just here. Knowledge. Computer whiz. I think nerd brain. Yeah. Rocket scientist. There
[8631.48s -> 8648.31s]  it is. Let's go. All right. Good. Werewolf? No, no, no, no werewolf. We're good. Okay. So now
[8649.88s -> 8671.38s]  the house is clean, right? I only have $558. What is this? Today is, uh, love day. I mean, that's,
[8671.38s -> 8688.82s]  yeah, I, I, I got, I'm not, I know. Some smells in the fridge. Clean, clean, clean. All right.
[8688.82s -> 8702.22s]  Ladder. Bathroom. That's what I need to do. Eat something. Is there more spoiled food in the fridge?
[8703.88s -> 8715.96s]  I'm going to cook because I need cooking, right? Steak tartare. Oh, I don't know. I just made me
[8715.96s -> 8739.32s]  hungry. I'm gonna make like beef ramen. Clean up. This is a mess. Hence for what? Missing out on
[8739.32s -> 8753.38s]  dreams. Become disliked by Santa. All right. Put the retro music on. Where is it? Retro, retro,
[8753.38s -> 8759.22s]  retro right there. What mods do you have? I, there's also a mod where you can put objects
[8759.22s -> 8765.22s]  as hats and stuff. I kind of don't know how to do it, but I'm, I think I'm satisfied with what we
[8765.22s -> 8776.62s]  got right now. Declare him an enemy. Didn't we go on vacation together though? I feel like, why would
[8776.62s -> 8791.26s]  I want to be, I feel like we're friends, right? Okay. So the dog, dog. Wow. Oh no. He beat the
[8791.26s -> 8796.97s]  shit out of me. That's right. At the end of the vacation, we had a big argument and he, and he
[8796.97s -> 8802.60s]  like punched me, beat the, he beat me up. He literally, he dropped me. He knocked me out
[8802.60s -> 8808.60s]  at the end of the vacation. Why though? Does anyone know why? I don't, I wasn't really paying
[8808.60s -> 8834.38s]  attention. Don't eat. Oh my God. Well, it's just him eating it. Sneeze directly into the food.
[8834.38s -> 8843.75s]  It's just, I'm gonna put it in the microwave, right? All right. That's beef ramen. That's
[8843.75s -> 8858.57s]  gonna be good. It's a quality. Excellent. Okay. All right. I fulfilled that. What's this? Find a
[8858.57s -> 8865.24s]  collectible. Ooh, I can do that. All right. So you're going to eat that and then come out here
[8865.24s -> 8885.10s]  and dig in the sand for something. I keep forgetting this is the default outfit he has. All
[8885.10s -> 8891.77s]  right. Let's see. I'm going to fulfill another dream here and then I got to go to the lounge and
[8891.77s -> 8903.00s]  be funny on the microphone. I can tell jokes. Message in a bottle. There it is. Do it for
[8903.00s -> 8920.09s]  everything. Let's see. Oh, it's love day. Okay. Message in the, uh, message in the sand. Oh,
[8920.09s -> 8940.36s]  just a bunch of bottles. Bottle. Bottle. All right. What do I do with these? Read this message.
[8940.36s -> 8943.48s]  When I was young, I lived in the shadow of a legend, but I decided to tell my own story.
[8943.48s -> 8949.96s]  I explored the world from historic Al Samara to tiny oasis springs. I sailed over a waterfall.
[8949.96s -> 8957.22s]  I kissed a llama. I climbed Mount Komoribi, been madly in love and raised my greatest pride. My
[8957.22s -> 8961.94s]  son, my life is full of memories and it's in its twilight. I sent a wish into the ocean and I fear
[8961.94s -> 8976.49s]  the shadow is surrounding you, but rather step out and shine brightly. Can I sell it or just play it?
[8977.05s -> 8998.31s]  That's an easy 12 grand. All right. It's love day. Social networking. Tech social media timeline.
[9001.24s -> 9009.29s]  Serve ramen to who? Practice program. I'm probably going to need programming.
[9010.49s -> 9028.31s]  Oh, let me guess. Dogs filthy. Slow dance with the dog. I don't think you can.
[9029.11s -> 9049.66s]  I have a fever. I'm sick. Please. You need to get hold on. I don't even know anybody.
[9050.22s -> 9070.65s]  Okay. Now take a shower. All right. We're good now. Two hours. You got to go to work and I've done
[9070.65s -> 9076.34s]  two breakthroughs. I need to be focused. How do I go focus quick? Read a book, right? I have to read
[9076.34s -> 9093.19s]  a book. Read this thing. Get off the computer. Get focused. Am I focused? Am I smelling the book?
[9103.02s -> 9118.74s]  Leave me alone. Am I focused? Come on. Be focused. No. He's a book smeller.
[9120.89s -> 9157.46s]  The bird feeder. There we go. Fill it. Trusty notepad in hand. It's time to...
[9157.46s -> 9182.58s]  No, go. I'm not doing that again. Go alone. I should wait. No, I'm sick. How do I call in sick?
[9182.58s -> 9195.26s]  All right. Calling sick. Call in sick to work. You're sick. No, don't call in fake sick.
[9196.70s -> 9204.12s]  Monsivzadeh. That... whatever. Arsifefroben. Lemino. Quar. Gorbaneh. Oh, Zaphis.
[9208.02s -> 9217.40s]  It's not fake sick. And I don't know why he still wants to serve ramen. What was that?
[9217.40s -> 9224.42s]  Oh, what was that? Did you see that? What was that?
[9236.30s -> 9243.46s]  Made a resolution, but it's the last day. What? Oh, I made a New Year's resolution. What was it?
[9243.46s -> 9273.53s]  How do I see it? Get a significant other. I have 20 hours to complete this. Okay. All right.
[9273.53s -> 9280.12s]  Okay. Wait, is there an event going on? Wait, wait, wait. Don't do that. Put this away.
[9280.12s -> 9288.95s]  Is there... there's an event, right? Is it some kind of thing going on in town?
[9288.95s -> 9296.18s]  Okay. Give flowers. Go on a date. Romantic spirit. Okay. I don't know. I have to, like,
[9296.18s -> 9300.50s]  maybe I should have to see who is available and see if there anyone's... I don't know. Interested?
[9300.50s -> 9322.49s]  I don't know. Am I sleeping in my chair again? All right. Travel. Um, travel. I think I'm just
[9322.49s -> 9341.98s]  gonna... I think I'm just gonna go somewhere. We'll do online dating. Okay. So, there's a
[9341.98s -> 9355.08s]  wedding venue. There's a lounge. A wedding? There's a wedding venue. There's not actually,
[9355.08s -> 9380.46s]  like, a wedding going on, right? No, it's just a venue. There's nobody even here. What? Freestyle
[9380.46s -> 9412.70s]  what? Are you fucking weirdo? There's nobody here. I'm pretending to...
[9419.00s -> 9444.65s]  Is there a wedding today? I'll just wait for it to start. I'm taking... I'm taking the fucking,
[9444.65s -> 9453.13s]  like, the seat of the parents. Will there be a wedding today? There are people here?
[9453.69s -> 9488.57s]  It's... okay. So, I... maybe these people are just checking out the venue? Oh, I thought I was gonna
[9488.57s -> 9494.02s]  use an extinguisher. It's not my wedding. Wait, is this the thing here? Hold on.
[9495.21s -> 9509.78s]  No. Should I plan an event here? What if I just invite a bunch of people here? Can I do that?
[9514.62s -> 9534.01s]  Invite to hang out at current lot. Imagine somebody gets married.
[9540.39s -> 9548.71s]  Okay. Not everyone could make it over. That's Santa. Santa doesn't want to come. And it's like,
[9548.71s -> 9562.14s]  no thanks, man. I don't think so. I got hung up on... This is weird. I'm just... send down the aisle?
[9564.87s -> 9595.77s]  Wha... wait. What's going on? Wait. Send down one sim. I have to greet people. Oh shit. Okay. Hey.
[9598.65s -> 9604.26s]  I already have to apologize. I think I have to apologize for inviting them here.
[9604.84s -> 9630.86s]  This guy hates my guts. Does anybody like me here? Can I call everybody over?
[9630.86s -> 9634.55s]  No. Flaunt wealth.
[9652.12s -> 9658.68s]  That was... they did not like... Oh, they... nobody likes that. Oh, I hate this. Oh my god. All right.
[9658.68s -> 9685.70s]  So set... What? What? So I am going... What did you take a picture of me for?
[9688.42s -> 9695.26s]  Don't take a picture of me. Don't put your finger in my face. Don't put your finger in my face.
[9695.42s -> 9726.89s]  This guy is very odd. What? If I... Hold on. I'm curious. If I send up the aisle,
[9729.22s -> 9738.23s]  send down... So, okay. I am going to escort you down the aisle. For what reason exactly?
[9738.23s -> 9776.42s]  She's Fortnite dancing. Yes. Somebody else is doing it. Somebody else is Fortnite dancing.
[9776.42s -> 9783.13s]  Finally. It took like two... It took like four hours. Somebody's finally Fortnite dancing
[9783.13s -> 9789.75s]  without me telling them to. Why did I get that excited about that? That's weird.
[9789.75s -> 9823.99s]  Did she die?
[9838.82s -> 9845.06s]  What? Who put the music on? Who put the music on? Turn the music off. That's fucking messed up.
[9845.78s -> 9849.86s]  Turn the music off. Turn the music off. Don't put the... Excuse me.
[9850.58s -> 9866.89s]  Oh, no. This is a tragedy. This is a tragedy. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're all just crying.
[9873.78s -> 9879.69s]  I can't press the button. I can't press the button. Somebody else has to press it for me.
[9879.69s -> 9881.69s]  Somebody else has to press this button for me. I can't press it.
[9881.77s -> 9911.45s]  I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Somebody else is doing it. You're going to take the mic?
[9917.96s -> 9928.54s]  Can't believe he's died. There's too many people in the way. He hates acting. The festival of light
[9928.54s -> 9943.02s]  has started. What happened? Acting sad. Everyone's taking a picture of death right now. This is
[9943.02s -> 9953.62s]  strange.
[9989.26s -> 9994.06s]  I'm gonna give you my lightsaber.
[9996.30s -> 9997.26s]  I hope you like it.
[10002.22s -> 10002.70s]  You like it?
[10002.70s -> 10022.54s]  You just took a lightsaber and left. That's going to show up on eBay in exactly two hours.
[10027.21s -> 10035.86s]  Authentic Sith lightsaber. Usually sells for $500, but I'm going to sell it for $220.
[10035.86s -> 10049.30s]  Last updated. Six minutes ago. I hear you love a bargain. If you want, I can... I can't believe
[10049.30s -> 10055.30s]  my nerve is dead. If you want, I can show you where to buy cheap ingredients. All right, sure.
[10055.86s -> 10066.66s]  That's... I... You and me gonna go hang out somewhere? Yeah, let's go. Oh, where are you?
[10067.70s -> 10074.87s]  At home. Really? Sounds like there's a lot of people there. Ah, it's a TV. I'm watching something
[10074.87s -> 10102.38s]  on TV. Do I say... Okay, so... I would not open with this. Guys, don't open with this. Ever.
[10102.38s -> 10111.24s]  Where am I going? Give yourself a pep talk.
[10121.67s -> 10124.47s]  I gotta freshen up a little. No, no, no. We're good. We're good. All right. So,
[10124.47s -> 10136.62s]  wait. No, no, no. No, I didn't leave. I didn't leave. I didn't leave. Let's do... How are you?
[10142.78s -> 10143.26s]  How's your day?
[10143.26s -> 10145.98s]  Barsp. Grenoy. Flippin' heavenly.
[10149.74s -> 10166.58s]  Okay. Wait, were you there? Did you... Did she call me at the wedding hall?
[10177.99s -> 10188.65s]  Okay. Good to know.
[10188.65s -> 10270.70s]  No. What? No. Go down. Oh, God. I don't know. I was just like... I didn't... We didn't even
[10270.70s -> 10277.93s]  know... We didn't even see it. Did I just save the game? Your notification wall is full.
[10278.57s -> 10308.26s]  Where am I? Wait, I did it? Wait, I... How did I do that? Who else? I don't know. I don't know. I
[10309.50s -> 10323.53s]  told you I wanted to use this shit sparingly. Get up. Get up.
[10342.38s -> 10413.32s]  I gave you my lightsaber. I did this. I'm not doing that ever again. I'm not doing it ever again.
[10413.32s -> 10419.30s]  It was the... It was the fact she just didn't... Look at my eye. She didn't come into the place.
[10419.30s -> 10444.25s]  She was just flossing. Everybody get... We get to do it once and now I'm not doing it ever again.
[10444.25s -> 10455.91s]  I'm not doing it ever again. I'm gonna... I still... I have to get up and I'm gonna go
[10455.91s -> 10467.91s]  talk... We're gonna talk things over with Santa. I just... I didn't know what I was gonna do.
[10472.63s -> 10499.93s]  I need to go take a shower. Why am I eating this with my hands? What did I just do?
[10501.93s -> 10529.21s]  Okay. We're good. I hate your Sim. I do too. Okay. I need to take a shower.
[10533.48s -> 10546.76s]  Hitting the leddy. Why am I still holding this bowl? Get up. How do I clean... How do I clean
[10546.76s -> 10566.09s]  myself? Outfits. Outfits. Okay. Change outfit. No. They're all gonna... Oh, I don't... I hate it.
[10566.09s -> 10574.25s]  Can I like go... Like go into the fountain or something? I need to get over here and talk to
[10574.25s -> 10595.34s]  people. I need to... I need to go over here. I... What time is it? Okay. It's... No, it's midnight.

[10623.56s -> 10641.77s]  food? Why? I can't... My energy is fine. Get up. Stop going to sleep in this chair.
[10661.40s -> 10677.26s]  Will you talk to me? No, dude. I need to talk to somebody. We'd have to just chat.
[10685.03s -> 10692.31s]  Okay.
[10708.02s -> 10715.62s]  I'm not poisoning the food. I'm telling you. We are... We've already hurt someone. I'm not doing...
[10715.62s -> 10737.78s]  No. You don't... Oh my god. You don't need to make any more food. That's not necessary. You don't
[10737.78s -> 10746.10s]  need to... This is... You've got like 15 people who have food here. What are you... Why are you
[10746.18s -> 10754.79s]  making this? Oh, I'm clean. You want to go stargazing?
[10767.90s -> 10799.77s]  Oh, hey. How are you? Hey. What's happening?
[10815.72s -> 10826.68s]  Overheating? Why am I overheating? Okay. I'm having a little bit of... I thought this was
[10826.68s -> 10837.67s]  blood. I was like, what? Blood from the car. Okay, we're making a new friend.
[10849.86s -> 10857.06s]  This game is ridiculous. What an unbelievable... It's just... It's just who?
[10885.86s -> 10892.06s]  How did you get in a call at 4 30 in the morning to come do a basketball competition?
[10892.06s -> 10910.38s]  You answered. You're here. Wait, it was you on the bench. Holy shit.
[10918.98s -> 10920.98s]  Is it ever going to not be funny? I don't know.
[10924.10s -> 10947.08s]  You're middle-aged? No, I'm a young adult. Look. What are you doing here?
[10947.08s -> 10954.14s]  Oh, yips. It's five o'clock in the morning.
[10961.50s -> 10964.78s]  All right. Hey, we're having fun. Whoa. Whoa. Settle down.
[10965.66s -> 10974.63s]  We're having a good time? This was a fun little outing.
[10977.11s -> 10987.82s]  See what's happening. All right. That's almost my turn. No one's missed a basket
[10987.82s -> 11001.54s]  the whole time we've been doing this. I've owned businesses. I don't have any money. I need to talk
[11001.62s -> 11033.80s]  to... Poor Jimmy Phipps. Poor Jimmy Phipps. You're making room. Oh, no. Wait. We need to...
[11035.48s -> 11043.80s]  We need to talk. We gotta talk. How's it going?
[11051.13s -> 11052.89s]  Hey, what about my galactic conquest?
[11057.69s -> 11058.49s]  Pretty cool, right?
[11062.81s -> 11078.54s]  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Share photos. I've got some photos, right? Okay. I got some
[11078.54s -> 11082.84s]  cool pictures of the galactic... of the Millennium Falcon ride.
[11097.70s -> 11099.78s]  Can you guys see our cars?
[11123.53s -> 11124.41s]  Let's talk about aliens.
[11128.47s -> 11129.35s]  You think aliens are real?
[11134.65s -> 11136.49s]  I think we've got a new best friend.
[11136.49s -> 11148.71s]  Oh, hey. There's a celebrity right there. Hey, dude. I don't know if you know this celebrity.
[11160.90s -> 11170.06s]  You can't shoot at the same time. Let's talk about the rain.
[11176.33s -> 11179.29s]  Oh, no. Pleasant conversation.
[11184.41s -> 11188.73s]  You're making fun of me? Oh, no, no, no. He was doing like a funny impression.
[11191.85s -> 11209.24s]  What about favorite singers? Oh, goodbye. All right. Well, we know Jimmy now.
[11217.53s -> 11239.86s]  Where am I? Oh, no. I gotta go to bed. I gotta go to bed. Yeah, it's time to go to bed.
[11243.69s -> 11283.32s]  The same spot. I can't. It has to be sparingly. We have to play the game or else it's going to be
[11284.34s -> 11291.74s]  nonstop. I was going to click on random people and like punch them and hit them with cars and
[11291.74s -> 11313.86s]  slap them. No, we have to be sparingly. It has to be sparingly. Go home, your dog. I'm trying.
[11313.86s -> 11328.81s]  I've clicked it like three times. You killed someone 27 minutes into the stream. That was
[11328.81s -> 11335.98s]  different because that was a defense. That was a defense maneuver. A vampire came in my house,
[11336.62s -> 11342.44s]  snarled in my face, yelled at my dog, and then started doing magical powers in my house.
[11349.08s -> 11356.34s]  Went like this, like and then yelled at my dog and then went, did a bunch of magical moves.
[11356.90s -> 11370.36s]  And then I decided I was like, I have to fight. What are you doing here? What are you doing here?
[11375.13s -> 11381.05s]  What are you? What are you looking at my mailbox for while I'm not here?
[11382.17s -> 11383.77s]  What are you looking at? Why are you looking in my mailbox?
[11383.77s -> 11388.82s]  So
[11410.55s -> 11413.99s]  we're getting friends. That's an important thing. You don't hate us.
[11414.63s -> 11415.43s]  Right.
[11435.67s -> 11436.39s]  I got to go.
[11439.59s -> 11443.82s]  I got to go. It's nice talking to you, but I got to go. I gotta go.
[11444.46s -> 11475.77s]  What's going on with this? This bathtub is so gross. Take a mud bath. Okay, I'll do it.
[11475.77s -> 11486.68s]  I've never done this before. Is this cool? Does this like feel good? Or I feel like it would be
[11486.68s -> 11499.80s]  weird, right? I don't. I feel like it'd be slimy and strange. I think it's time to just invite
[11499.80s -> 11514.20s]  Santa over and just just hash this out. I've been wanting to. What's wrong? The pet is afraid of
[11514.20s -> 11522.39s]  the bath because of the mud or because of what I the what what what you don't like the mud bath.
[11526.54s -> 11531.74s]  What just happened? Did I just pass? Get out of the bath. Get out of the bath right now.
[11531.74s -> 11541.46s]  Get out of the bath. Out. Out of the bath now. I fell asleep and I went under the mud.
[11544.74s -> 11559.38s]  Okay. Hey, you're good. Well, when I get up, you're taking a bath tomorrow.
[11561.26s -> 11565.11s]  And I have to go to work again in two days. All right. I got some time.
[11565.11s -> 11570.25s]  We're going to get your bath and then we're going to play fetch outside.
[11572.52s -> 11584.58s]  I think I'm still employed. I hope so. Oh, no. I'm delighted you recommended I spend some time with
[11584.58s -> 11608.74s]  Kazooia. I was amused. I'm hallucinating. What's the matter? All right. Come here. Come here.
[11608.74s -> 11615.16s]  We're going to take care of you right now. Give you a bath. Give you some attention and then we'll
[11615.16s -> 11620.20s]  play some fetch. Actually, no, let's do. I haven't even done this with you. It's raining. Never mind.
[11620.20s -> 11636.47s]  I'm not actually going to eat this like six month old hamburger cake, right? Come over here. Yeah,
[11636.95s -> 11668.26s]  we're good. What are you doing? I almost just took a picture of you. Okay. What's with my frame rate?
[11668.26s -> 11694.36s]  Stop eating old cake. This guy died. It's cake. He eats cake and hot dog buns. Okay. We're going to
[11694.36s -> 11704.33s]  go pet the dog. Oh, having fun with your ball. That's good. Come over there. Let's go. Okay.
[11704.33s -> 11719.91s]  Brush. Yeah. Brush. Brush. Get out of the bathroom. Brush. Been a while. Will you go over here?
[11719.91s -> 11742.95s]  Brush. How do you feel? Much better. All right. Let's do this for a minute here.
[11748.26s -> 11764.86s]  Let's play. Yeah. He eats cake. The only thing I eat. Part of a well-balanced diet.
[11764.86s -> 11786.94s]  Okay. Very nice. Three points in dancing. Four points in rocket science.
[11794.44s -> 11796.36s]  All right. Well, then let's put on kids music.
[11825.91s -> 11827.03s]  Let's just get this out of the way.
[11851.98s -> 11876.46s]  It's 3.30 in the morning. When does Santa get up?
[11921.94s -> 11945.53s]  Come on over Santa. Let's figure this out. Get up. How many servings are in this hamburger cake?
[11945.53s -> 11957.48s]  I don't understand. This is what I've been eating for. It feels like a month listening to retro
[11957.48s -> 11997.18s]  music. It's summer now. Does Santa even exist in the summer? 7 a.m. When does Santa get up?
[11997.18s -> 12016.33s]  Santa's in the North Pole, which is what time zone? What time is it? 8 a.m. Okay. It's 8 a.m.
[12017.34s -> 12030.26s]  Let's go. I want to hash this out. They'd rather not come over. Okay. Dude.
[12030.26s -> 12051.80s]  Dude. What if I find him through FaceTime?
[12051.80s -> 12088.70s]  Oh, that's what you wanted. Okay.
[12088.70s -> 12120.95s]  Okay. So what if I traveled just to this location? Wait, does Santa have to be there?
[12121.59s -> 12156.47s]  This is a rental? Can we just go here? What do you mean rental? Host a party. He didn't show up.
[12156.47s -> 12215.59s]  Holy shit. Where am I? Hurry up. What? Festival of Youth? Wait, Santa might be there. All right. I
[12215.59s -> 12232.46s]  got to get. Okay. What's the like a sorry like an apology flower? What's a sorry flower? Get the
[12232.46s -> 12241.78s]  Christmas rose? Okay. Actually, that's a good idea. I'm going to buy snapdrakens because I think
[12241.78s -> 12261.62s]  they're cool. Okay. What is this? Oh, a painting.
[12261.62s -> 12284.17s]  For free. Who's painted this? I'm not. I'm not actually going to do this. I'm going to replace
[12284.17s -> 12287.45s]  it with a different painting. They're going to come back and be like, what the fuck did I take?
[12288.42s -> 12307.18s]  Why was I like on crack? Can I even paint? Dude, stop. God, this guy's such a weirdo.
[12310.33s -> 12321.48s]  Did you paint? Oh, no. You just want to chat. Okay. Let's talk. Okay. That's fine.
[12321.48s -> 12325.24s]  Okay. Wait, what are we talking about here?
[12332.20s -> 12333.00s]  Okay.
[12353.46s -> 12360.20s]  Oh, what is this painting? Let's chat. Discuss. What did I just say?
[12362.28s -> 12371.19s]  It's induced about a new show. Uh, Steve Friendly. Um, likes and dislikes. Uh, get to know.
[12371.43s -> 12372.23s]  Oh, sure.
[12374.23s -> 12375.11s]  30. Okay.
[12382.90s -> 12383.54s]  What's going on here?
[12394.01s -> 12394.97s]  Don't talk about aliens.
[12397.61s -> 12402.87s]  How about, um, what about dance techniques and stuff? What am I doing? Don't take a nap.
[12403.59s -> 12409.43s]  What's cloud gaze? Cloud gaze.
[12415.08s -> 12416.76s]  Bombaday. Let's go.
[12468.12s -> 12470.52s]  What exactly am I gaining a skill in here?
[12470.52s -> 12502.79s]  Okay. Um, why am I so tired? Oh, that's my house right there. What's this place?
[12502.79s -> 12507.10s]  Well, I'll get some food. How about some egg rolls? That sounds good.
[12533.59s -> 12543.74s]  Okay. Why is this? Why is my torso so wide?
[12549.35s -> 12555.93s]  Okay. Are you going to sit down? Hey, what's up? Don't do that.
[12557.05s -> 12561.45s]  How are you doing? Did you get something? You learned how to make egg rolls.
[12562.09s -> 12565.46s]  How are you? How's it? How are you guys doing?
[12575.02s -> 12576.62s]  We're all enjoying ourselves.
[12588.78s -> 12589.98s]  I'm telling a gross joke.
[12595.26s -> 12596.14s]  So what a new life.
[12603.34s -> 12604.38s]  You don't like fitness.
[12613.34s -> 12621.38s]  How about, um, it has to be sim of honor.
[12621.94s -> 12629.70s]  Wait, you get, can I come to the wedding? There's a wedding. Can I go to the wedding?
[12635.78s -> 12639.06s]  Yes. All right. I'm actually going to get to go. I'm going to get to go to a wedding.
[12639.06s -> 12643.78s]  This is awesome. Perfect. When is the wedding? When's the wedding?
[12648.87s -> 12653.91s]  Congratulations. All right. All right. Perfect.
[12656.23s -> 12689.34s]  When's the wedding? My birthday. When's the wedding? It's not real. It's next year. What?
[12694.84s -> 12704.52s]  Really? Don't forget about, don't forget about me.
[12710.12s -> 12712.84s]  So excited for your engagement. I can't wait for the wedding.
[12712.84s -> 12724.65s]  Do I actually get an invitation? I gotta make sure I'm invited.
[12729.58s -> 12743.40s]  I'm so enthusiastic about this. All right. We got invited. We got invited to the wedding.
[12743.40s -> 12760.70s]  You know, I'm going to, I'm going in there. I feel like I don't even go swimming in my own
[12760.70s -> 12767.30s]  private swimming pool. Wait, this is my house. Where's my house? Oh, it's not even here.
[12767.30s -> 12793.51s]  Where is my house? Where am I? Isn't my house right here somewhere? Oh well. All right. This
[12793.51s -> 12813.69s]  is nice and relaxing. It's trying to, okay. I gotta get out of here. I gotta go home. I can't
[12813.69s -> 12828.50s]  believe I have to wait a year to go to that wedding. Why am I? Oh, here's my house. It's not a real
[12828.50s -> 12841.99s]  wedding. The wedding doesn't exist. What do you mean? There is no wedding. Invite Santa as your
[12841.99s -> 12859.10s]  plus one. All right. Uh, bathroom and then sleep. You got food, right? Yeah. All right. You're going
[12859.10s -> 12876.36s]  to bed too. Let's go. I should wait before I go to bed. Turn that off. Did I miss? Okay. I gotta
[12876.36s -> 12896.62s]  go to work tomorrow. Let's get a full night's sleep. All night sleep. Peaceful. What career?
[12896.62s -> 12913.88s]  I am doing rocket scientist. I need more logic and I need to read three books. It's rebate day.
[12916.89s -> 12921.13s]  All objects purchased in build mode are in a 10% rebate. Buy an object worth at least 500
[12921.77s -> 12940.76s]  to complete this tradition. Why do I care about that? That's what I hear like sprinkly sounds.
[12940.76s -> 12965.21s]  What was that? What is going on? Hey man, over here. Grab yourself a piece of a hamburger cake.
[12965.21s -> 12990.76s]  Still fresh. I'm about to get points in something. What is it? Yep. All right. I gotta just wash
[12991.16s -> 13015.51s]  my teeth and use the bathroom and then I gotta go. I gotta. Yep. All right. Go to work. Just go.
[13015.51s -> 13022.18s]  I don't think I'm ready to get a promotion here. I'm not. I mean, I did the two breakthroughs.
[13022.18s -> 13056.63s]  We'll see. Dog's really happy. That's good. What is he doing? Check the dog's stats. How do I do
[13056.63s -> 13093.61s]  that? You can check its stats. What do I do? What do I do? Do you love with the microwave?
[13096.54s -> 13128.94s]  What's happening? Oh my God. Relax. I don't even. I'm not going to that. Take your dog to the vet.
[13128.94s -> 13135.69s]  Yes. Okay. All right. We're going to go to the humor and high drinks festival and we're going
[13135.69s -> 13169.02s]  to go. We're going to bring a few friends along with us. I'm in my work clothes. Don't do that.
[13169.02s -> 13187.45s]  Don't do that. Don't do that. Furious with someone nearby. Oh, didn't I come here with somebody?
[13187.45s -> 13199.83s]  We gotta figure this out right now. What's your problem? What's your problem? Tell me.
[13205.13s -> 13210.04s]  What's your problem? You punched me in the face at the end of our vacation. Hey,
[13210.04s -> 13213.72s]  this drama isn't my fault. It's not completely. I'm allowed to feel bitter about what's happened
[13213.72s -> 13228.06s]  between us. But why? Look, I'm going to apologize. I don't know what I did. I didn't do anything. I
[13228.70s -> 13248.20s]  attacked me at the end of our vacation. We good? I guess we're vibing. I think we figured it out.
[13248.20s -> 13265.46s]  I think we settled our differences. It seems. Hey, all it takes is an apology and a Fortnite dance
[13265.46s -> 13296.95s]  and you can rebuild some of those bridges. I'm not going to do it. I just want to see what's
[13296.95s -> 13310.95s]  available. Choke on a grilled cheese? What does that mean? Rip his heart out. What?
[13313.11s -> 13328.79s]  I don't care. I have to do it. Wait, he's still alive. I'm just kidding. It was a joke.
[13334.15s -> 13338.65s]  How do I apologize? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where's apologize? What's apologize?
[13338.65s -> 13341.98s]  You can't kill Christmas. Quick. Apologize.
[13360.54s -> 13367.26s]  Here's the thing. No one's going to believe him. Oh, you don't understand. He attacked me
[13367.26s -> 13375.54s]  with a lightsaber. He's a Sith Lord and he slashed me with a lightsaber. What? He has a lightsaber?
[13375.54s -> 13390.84s]  What do you mean? I keep trying to apologize. No, it's not working.
[13390.84s -> 13417.72s]  No, it's okay. I'm just trying to. I gotta find common ground.
[13427.67s -> 13435.03s]  Are we going to find common ground?
[13435.91s -> 13447.11s]  I'll give you a thousand dollars if you just stop. I'll give you a thousand dollars.
[13447.75s -> 13458.50s]  Here, take some money. Here's a thousand bucks. A thousand dollars. Pretty cool. That's a good
[13458.50s -> 13470.44s]  gift. Everyone's like, wow, I can't believe it. Here we go. Okay. Now let's just chill.
[13470.68s -> 13487.99s]  What's he calling? Are you calling? Put that phone down.
[13487.99s -> 13509.40s]  What am I bringing the chips over? What did I just try to bite him?
[13511.77s -> 13522.50s]  I think I just tried to bite him. Did I burp in his face?
[13523.14s -> 13573.62s]  Wait, hold on. What's happening right now? Is somebody getting arrested? Who's getting
[13573.62s -> 13582.81s]  arrested? Did he call the police? I don't understand what happened. What, because I
[13582.81s -> 13592.23s]  took a lightsaber out? Where did I go? I need to read this.
[13606.98s -> 13611.61s]  He can throw his very own lampoon party.
[13611.61s -> 13622.79s]  Did he just, what did he just do?
[13635.13s -> 13642.39s]  You did attack Santa with a lightsaber. Those are like just the things I don't,
[13642.39s -> 13650.76s]  I don't think whatever sentence I've never said. I mean, yes, I did attack Santa with a lightsaber.
[13650.76s -> 13664.78s]  But then I gave him a thousand bucks and we hashed it out and then he called the police.
[13664.78s -> 13693.30s]  Wait, what? Is the person supposed to punch me and steal my money? Who?
[13693.70s -> 13708.22s]  Hey, did you know it was a rebate day?
[13719.69s -> 13727.53s]  All right, time for bed. Wait, I'm almost, how old am I? Okay, I'm almost an adult.
[13727.53s -> 13737.13s]  Who was punching people? They said this person's been punching me and tried to take my money.
[13737.13s -> 13755.70s]  Am I ordering drinks? You slapped Santa. No, but I didn't slap anybody else.
[13756.66s -> 13761.43s]  I said, hey, this sim is slapping me and trying to take my money. That's not Santa didn't say that.
[13768.09s -> 13790.47s]  All right, go home. Somebody was dancing. Your sim was saying that about the other clerk that
[13790.47s -> 13801.64s]  left. She wanted to take your money. Really? All right, we got, we're going to the vet tomorrow
[13801.64s -> 13808.02s]  because I don't know what this means. Do I have to work? Oh, I got to work tomorrow.
[13808.02s -> 13849.69s]  I think this is dirty ass bathtub. I have to put a fire out. Order a pizza. Bitter about Santa.
[13854.57s -> 13864.63s]  Hey, come over here. Let's, I'm going to take you to the vet when I get back from work tomorrow.
[13869.80s -> 13885.11s]  I'm going to take a bath. So I think, honestly, I think the funniest thing that happened today
[13886.06s -> 13893.62s]  was the getting off of the spaceship, shitting my pants and falling asleep in the chair at the
[13893.62s -> 13904.82s]  geek convention. I don't think anything will compare to that. I keep thinking about it.
[13904.82s -> 13910.74s]  It keeps popping up here. Just sitting down, nodding this way and shitting my pants after
[13910.74s -> 13916.22s]  getting off. I have like three, like what would probably amount to like 10 light years worth of
[13916.22s -> 13928.65s]  time traveling. Okay. I can't believe you can tap me. This game is unbelievable. How do I keep
[13928.65s -> 13949.80s]  sleeping on this game? I only have any money. Imagine shitting yourself at Comic-Con. I have
[13949.80s -> 13958.50s]  $58. I gave Santa a thousand dollars for forgiveness and it worked for 10 seconds.
[13958.50s -> 13986.15s]  And then he called the police. All right. Get to bed. There's too much to do. All right. Get up.
[13986.15s -> 13990.86s]  I've got a lucrative opportunity for someone who doesn't ask too many questions. I need you to hold
[13990.86s -> 13998.31s]  onto a stack of money. What? I need you to hold onto a stack of simoleons. I'm planning to launder
[13998.31s -> 14011.13s]  until the trail turns cold. Sure. It may not be legal or moral, but it'll help. That's all I got
[14011.13s -> 14031.38s]  to do. Anybody want a piece of cake? It's the only food I eat. Spend all the money to get a
[14031.38s -> 14036.82s]  huge plasma screen TV. And when she shows up, I don't know what happened. Somebody attacked me for
[14036.82s -> 14074.54s]  it. Time for work. Six minutes. Just go. Okay. Actually it might get promoted. It's possible.
[14074.54s -> 14091.02s]  Although I'm uncomfortable. This has to be a little bit higher, right? Not quite. What's up?
[14091.02s -> 14096.65s]  Just stop calling me for this shit. Hey, Blork. I wanted to know. I'm trying to get to know this
[14096.65s -> 14116.02s]  other sim. Do you think I should? It's like, why? What does this even do for me? All right. We are
[14116.02s -> 14132.97s]  going to go to the vet. How do I go about doing this? I think it's travel, right? Travel? He's
[14132.97s -> 14142.65s]  in a lightsaber mood. Ow. That hurt. The vet's in a different world. Where's the vet? Newcrest?
[14143.29s -> 14171.08s]  This is empty. Uh, where's the vet? Brindleton? Okay. So we need to go to here. Okay. The clinic.
[14171.08s -> 14199.05s]  And let's just go for a checkup. Okay. Hello. It's my pleasure to meet you. How's everybody
[14199.05s -> 14232.44s]  doing? Um, I'd like for someone to check out the dog. Oh, look at this little cat. Hey, hey.
[14233.16s -> 14240.62s]  Oh, um, we'll just do a checkup.
[14259.00s -> 14260.12s]  Drain all blood?
[14281.26s -> 14296.44s]  Where am I going? All right. Let's, where's the, let's go. Let's get the pet examined.
[14298.76s -> 14300.20s]  Come on. Let's check. Let's see how you're doing.
[14309.72s -> 14318.89s]  Get pet examined. Okay. Here we go. How are you doing? Let's check. Let's get a checkup.
[14318.97s -> 14340.62s]  Oh. Okay.
[14357.91s -> 14380.78s]  Okay. We can do this too. This is, this person kind of work. No babies. What? Oh yeah. But I mean.
[14381.50s -> 14404.49s]  Hey. Oh, look. How you doing? You okay?
[14417.05s -> 14418.49s]  Is this a dog or a cat?
[14423.11s -> 14426.63s]  That's a dog. Okay. I thought it was like, wait, is that, is that a cat?
[14426.63s -> 14442.89s]  Cat. Okay. I'm going to go on their computer. I can buy a vet clinic.
[14445.24s -> 14447.24s]  I don't have any money. This is not going to happen.
[14453.02s -> 14469.05s]  All right. So we're done. We're going to head back. Cool. Where's my dog? Hey, come on. We're
[14469.05s -> 14500.12s]  going to go. Let's go. We're going home. Oh, you did such a good job. Whereas come here. You did.
[14500.12s -> 14524.70s]  You had, you did such a good job. I'm going to give you a big treat. Change outfit. I know. I
[14524.70s -> 14535.16s]  know that thing's annoying, but come on inside. Let's go. I don't want any strenuous activity.
[14535.24s -> 14543.54s]  I'm going to clean this bath. How do I clean them? How do I clean this? It's fucking gross.
[14544.18s -> 14559.19s]  Oh, there we go. Okay. Okay. Go to the, no, you don't have to use the bathroom. All right.
[14559.19s -> 14585.70s]  So now I need to eat. Drop it. Oh, no, no, no. I don't have to drop it. You're fine. What's first
[14585.70s -> 14610.26s]  person mode? Tea, right? All right. Let's go. Holy shit. You maniac. Why did you do that?
[14611.26s -> 14635.98s]  Why would you do that? How do I look at the, it's kind of scary. How do I get access to the mouse
[14635.98s -> 14689.29s]  to look at stuff? Escape. Oh, okay. That was weird. Troll forum. You only have work in minutes.
[14699.58s -> 14719.58s]  I'm going to let him do it. Are you having a good time at least? Wait, it's summertime. I'm going
[14719.58s -> 14747.46s]  for a swim. Wait, it's getting dip with who? Hey, hold on. Carpool will be at work here soon. Hold
[14747.46s -> 14783.88s]  just wait a minute. I have to, I have to swim naked in the ocean for five minutes. Get into your
[14783.88s -> 14807.35s]  house. What are you doing? I'm not going to go to work naked. No, you change into work clothes.
[14807.35s -> 14826.46s]  Yeah, you do. All right. Seems pretty happy. I said, dude, no offense, but your house looks
[14826.46s -> 14834.25s]  like a hotel room. Do I still have this angry, anger bug that I never fixed? That's actually
[14834.25s -> 14862.38s]  kind of funny. Yell at coworkers. All right. I haven't been promoted. Okay. Retro music.
[14862.78s -> 14880.20s]  It wants me to put a fire out. How do I start a fire? How do I start a fire? I need to put a fire
[14880.20s -> 14900.71s]  out. All right. What do I want to listen to? Retro music. Right. All right. But Phil, there you go.
[14901.27s -> 14921.69s]  Aren't you happy? And I'm going to order a pizza. I'm going to get a pepperoni. That sounds so good,
[14921.69s -> 14938.26s]  actually. Pepperoni pizza sounds amazing right now. Thin crust. Yep. Thin crust. You can hold it up
[14938.26s -> 14944.97s]  and it goes like this. Like that. Not like this. Like that. And you fold it a little bit at the end
[14944.97s -> 14959.98s]  and you... I... People go, will you fold? I fold sometimes. Not every time, but enough sometimes
[14959.98s -> 14977.69s]  when I do it. And you get that sting, that tang, that umami. When did I say that? I was talking
[14977.69s -> 14981.29s]  about it. I was eating food and I said, there's too much umami in this and I couldn't eat it
[14981.29s -> 14995.64s]  anymore. And I was high. Ollie, are you here? I was eating something and it was too umami and I
[14995.64s -> 15001.67s]  couldn't eat it anymore. I was like, this is like umami overload. And I just, I couldn't eat it
[15001.67s -> 15011.99s]  anymore. It was like too delicious. It was like overload. I forget what it was. It was... Wait,
[15011.99s -> 15024.36s]  really? It was blue cheese sauce that you put all over a garlic pizza. I think that's right.
[15029.74s -> 15045.72s]  And it was just... I couldn't take it. It was fucking delicious. It was a no red sauce pizza.
[15046.28s -> 15056.94s]  What was it? It was... Okay. It was a buffalo chicken pizza that I put a bunch of blue cheese
[15056.94s -> 15068.31s]  sauce on and it was overloading me. It was a buffalo chicken pizza covered in blue cheese.
[15068.31s -> 15074.79s]  And the type of sauce on the pizza and they had the way that it was hitting me right here to a
[15074.79s -> 15079.11s]  point where I couldn't eat it anymore. It was actually sensory overload. You were also really
[15079.11s -> 15089.10s]  high. Yeah. I mean, I was little. Again, like, you know, recreational marijuana is legal in Las Vegas.
[15089.10s -> 15098.39s]  Don't overdo it. You know, if you're of age and you, you know, something that you feel like doing,
[15098.39s -> 15102.31s]  just be safe about it and don't do it all the time. Do it, you know, sometimes. If you don't,
[15102.31s -> 15111.42s]  don't be pressured to fucking do anything like that. Same thing with alcohol. Do it the same way.
[15111.42s -> 15120.95s]  Where's my pizza? What? You didn't show up to... Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where's
[15120.95s -> 15141.83s]  my pizza? Why would I be enemies with this person? I ordered a pizza and made... What are you doing?
[15141.83s -> 15149.50s]  I microwaved a pastry and I ordered... That's what you ate instead. That's the person that
[15149.50s -> 15169.00s]  wanted to take your money. Really? Interesting. I don't have this person on my social list.
[15173.00s -> 15183.16s]  What happened with Santa? Well, I'll give you a quick TLDR in case you don't want to watch the
[15183.16s -> 15189.14s]  VOD or watch these streams. Santa and I, we had a big Christmas party. Yes, this is yesterday's
[15189.14s -> 15194.34s]  stream. Had a big Christmas party. A bunch of people came over. We had a bunch of fun. We sang
[15194.34s -> 15199.96s]  a bunch of Christmas songs. Santa showed up and I thought Santa was trying to shoot me with a gun
[15199.96s -> 15211.59s]  and I freaked out about it. Then I got mad at him. We ended up having a... We hashed it out
[15211.59s -> 15217.03s]  and we went on vacation to Star Wars Land. Everything was perfectly fine. Everything was
[15217.03s -> 15221.83s]  very normal. This was not a problem. It was like we're at Star Wars Land. We're having a good time.
[15221.83s -> 15228.73s]  We split up. I became part of the First Order, which is like PogChamp. Santa did some... Dressed
[15228.73s -> 15233.37s]  up as a stormtrooper and was just kind of eating the restaurants and stuff. It was cool. It was
[15233.37s -> 15240.81s]  fine. At the very end of the trip before leaving, Santa attacked me. I don't know why. I actually
[15240.81s -> 15244.49s]  don't have any idea why. I don't... Can somebody... Actually, this is like not a joke or we're not
[15244.49s -> 15253.50s]  fucking around. Why did Santa attack me at the end of the vacation? Then we became enemies.
[15253.50s -> 15260.30s]  You checked his ID and it was fake, so he fought you. You tried to turn him into the First Order.
[15260.30s -> 15267.78s]  All right, but we're at Star Wars Land, dude. Really? They give us badges to what do you want
[15267.78s -> 15272.17s]  to do. Oh, I want to pretend to be in the First Order. I want to be in the Rebel Alliance. You
[15272.17s -> 15279.22s]  don't take it that seriously. It's like, dude, we like played a game of Among Us and I caught
[15279.22s -> 15287.91s]  you as the imposter and you stopped talking to me on Discord. Like, come on. So, eventually,
[15287.91s -> 15293.03s]  it got to the point where, you know, I wanted to hash it out at this party that we went to
[15293.93s -> 15299.13s]  and just said, kind of, fuck it. He was pissing me off and he said a bunch of mean shit about me,
[15299.13s -> 15309.91s]  so I took out my lightsaber and I fucking slashed him. Why am I microwaving food?
[15312.33s -> 15329.03s]  Oh no. Okay, so I'm eating too many pieces of cake and microwaved food. This is what I get
[15329.03s -> 15342.54s]  for eating all that cake every day. What do you want me to do? Okay, watch TV. Yep, turn on TV.
[15342.54s -> 15351.29s]  Watch, um, I don't know, whatever. Watch the kids network. You want to hear the kids music.
[15351.29s -> 15371.21s]  And now I'm flirt with Bako. Okay, how do I get a hold of Bako? Okay, that was fulfilled. Listen to
[15371.21s -> 15400.76s]  kids music. You want to watch kids TV and kids music. Go dance to it. The games are on now.
[15400.76s -> 15432.46s]  I'm doing it. That actually scared the shit out of me. How many hours do I have to listen to this
[15432.46s -> 15449.43s]  before he's happy about it? Who's outside? Is there somebody outside? Somebody said this looks
[15449.43s -> 15460.76s]  like a hotel room. What's your favorite stoner? Well, let's not use the term stoner. Partake
[15460.76s -> 15470.55s]  sparingly. Uh, I have a really, really embarrassing confession to tell everybody here. Even when I
[15470.55s -> 15474.87s]  talked a ton of shit about Takis and I was like, this, these things are disgusting. They just taste
[15474.87s -> 15485.54s]  like acid and all the music sped up. I heard like, I was like, why am I getting stabbed? Um,
[15485.54s -> 15498.30s]  but anyways, yeah. So Takis, I, I feel like there's this weird thing where I ate one one time
[15498.30s -> 15504.66s]  and I had never really eaten them before. I said, these are gross. I don't like these. I'm never
[15504.66s -> 15514.04s]  going to buy these again. I said that for real. I don't like these. I'm never buying these again.
[15514.04s -> 15522.09s]  Maybe six months later, I just saw them in the grocery store and did this weird, like ironic,
[15522.65s -> 15531.54s]  I'm going to buy them because it's ironic and funny. So I bought a bag of them and I eat them
[15531.54s -> 15554.66s]  all the time now. What happened? So I don't know why. Your pizza is in the mailbox? Elderly dog.
[15565.11s -> 15573.10s]  Why? This is ridiculous. I would be pissed about it too. You put my pizza in the mailbox.
[15573.98s -> 15587.40s]  You like prankster. That's some prankster shit. You know what I mean? Is it still good? It's still
[15587.40s -> 15635.30s]  good. He's going to leave it there. Oh shit. Hey bills, make sure you turn on the kids music.
[15635.30s -> 15685.18s]  Wait, he's going back? What? Hold on. You went back to get another slice. This is like a puppet
[15685.18s -> 15714.68s]  combo game. What's wrong? Just go to work. You strange, strange man. Does my breath stink?
[15714.68s -> 15735.67s]  Look at all the puke faces. That's a lot of vomit faces. Okay. I don't think I'm ever going to get
[15735.67s -> 15780.34s]  promoted. Let's just get into that. Discuss fears. Listen to lullabies. You got it. Volume's on
[15780.34s -> 15796.55s]  really high. I feel like this is a Mr. Beast video. Playing this music really loud and you
[15796.55s -> 15826.04s]  have to try to sleep the whole night through it or something. Sorry. Sorry. You left the circle
[15826.04s -> 15865.67s]  where the bed was. You don't get the $100,000. NPR music? What? How is this NPR music? He fell
[15865.67s -> 15887.38s]  asleep in the chair. All right. Did I listen to the lullabies? Enough. In case he eats it.
[15887.46s -> 15910.12s]  I'm just going to poison this piece and leave. It already is poisoned. I just...
[15910.12s -> 15927.46s]  Oh, I can't eat it. Oh, grab a poisoned serving. Throw it away. Oh, wait. The dog won't eat it,
[15927.46s -> 15951.78s]  right? Get rid of it. Turn this off. What time does it work? I actually have excellent performance
[15951.78s -> 15965.90s]  right now. I actually might get promoted one more day to see if I can do this. I'm hungry,
[15965.90s -> 15974.20s]  though. There's so many things that smell in here. The house is filling with gas.
[15974.20s -> 15997.03s]  How are you doing? Need to go out? This is still full, right? Yep. Clean the hell up.
[15997.03s -> 16001.43s]  Ira made... Dude, I have 1500 bucks to my name. I'm going to lose all that money.
[16010.81s -> 16016.12s]  Brush and then give a big treat. And then I'm going to make a big treat, too,
[16016.12s -> 16050.87s]  by microwaving a microwave dinner. Where are you going? Oh, she's so slow. She's perfect.
[16050.87s -> 16077.22s]  A big treat. Coming to a weird realization. The dog eats better than I do.
[16077.22s -> 16124.20s]  Not enthusiastic about it anymore. He's just doing it because I told him to.
[16125.66s -> 16140.84s]  He doesn't even want to do this. Oh, that hurt. Somebody said this is really depressing.
[16147.27s -> 16163.18s]  Microwaving a dinner and flossing is actually kind of sad. That's sad. This is actually depressing.
[16163.18s -> 16178.49s]  He won't even eat it. The nonchalant, not caring loss. I got my microwave dinner. That was so sad.
[16182.95s -> 16199.46s]  It's like he was so enthusiastic months and months ago about doing the floss when he has a delicious
[16199.46s -> 16204.26s]  meal. It's almost like he's doing it because he feels like he has to now. Because he wants to.
[16204.26s -> 16208.34s]  It's just like, I feel like I have to. This is what I do, man. I make my dinner and I do floss,
[16209.22s -> 16222.18s]  I guess. That was so fucking funny. It was so awful. He's clearly had enough. Yeah. I could
[16222.18s -> 16238.44s]  probably eat the dog food and be healthier. I already was single and loving it. That already
[16238.44s -> 16246.14s]  was unlocked. All right. It's time to go to work in excellent condition. Need to go to the bathroom,
[16246.70s -> 16280.73s]  brush my teeth, and we'll go. What the hell is this? Trash fruit? Harvest trash fruit.
[16280.73s -> 16302.90s]  Where did that come from? Let's take care of it. I mean, it's here. It exudes a constant stream
[16302.90s -> 16317.34s]  of smelly odors. Where did this, did somebody plant this? All right. I'm in good. I need to,
[16317.34s -> 16325.03s]  let me read a book. I'm going to read the, ah, nevermind. All right. I'm confident. I'm
[16325.03s -> 16339.26s]  doing pretty well right now. No. Oh, my dream of waking up and listening to Twinkle Twinkle Little
[16339.26s -> 16349.96s]  Star every single day. Sorry. That dream's fucking weird. It's my dream to listen to Twinkle Twinkle
[16349.96s -> 16360.15s]  Little Star every single day of my life. That's weird. That's a weird dream. Every day of his
[16360.15s -> 16367.22s]  life. Every single day. I'm never going to get promoted. Doesn't like being around other Sims.
[16367.22s -> 16379.77s]  How am I ever going to be, get promoted? Okay. Level up the hand. I can do that. Can we upgrade
[16379.77s -> 16403.96s]  the, can I upgrade anything? I can't. I am going to do, what should I do? So I just try to just
[16403.96s -> 16411.27s]  go completely focused on making sure he's healthy and get it. You need to get a table. Buy a business.
[16411.27s -> 16428.58s]  I have $1,700. I didn't, he's still eating microwaved food and just desserts every day.
[16429.40s -> 16436.25s]  No wonder he's so fucked up. No wonder he's so, he's got something wrong. I need to get,
[16436.89s -> 16452.31s]  clean out the fridge. It's time. It's time. Get rid of everything. Get rid of all this food in here.
[16452.31s -> 16460.62s]  Dump out all the leftovers. Get them out. Good. Get the microwave pastry. You put 10 in there.
[16460.62s -> 16464.46s]  You microwave 10 pastries and put all 10 in. Get it out and don't eat it and throw it away.
[16464.46s -> 16474.92s]  That's enough. Put that, put it down. No, put it down. You know, just eat it. Just eat it.
[16475.88s -> 16478.68s]  Just eat it. Eat it. That's the last of it. It's not, you're not getting any more of that.
[16507.37s -> 16508.57s]  Passionless job.
[16508.65s -> 16518.49s]  Job. I think he hates his job, but his aspirations are to be a nerd.
[16522.12s -> 16526.76s]  His aspirations are to be a nerd, yet he doesn't like his job, but he's, that's, he's in the,
[16526.76s -> 16547.54s]  one of the biggest nerd jobs ever. Isn't this his aspirations? Right? You're in the biggest nerd job
[16547.54s -> 16557.69s]  ever. True. But, uh, mine does not require you to be intelligent. So there's a big difference.
[16561.06s -> 16594.82s]  In fact, it's the complete opposite, I would say. Whoa. Where did that come from? Go swimming?
[16602.89s -> 16606.01s]  All right. Stop, stop, stop that. Enough, enough, enough. No more eating,
[16606.57s -> 16618.68s]  lick, drinking, drinking. Stop drinking out of the toilet. Get out of the toilet. Enough. Stop that.
[16618.68s -> 16638.90s]  I didn't mean to say that. Oh my God. Oh my God. This is so stupid.
[16643.45s -> 16669.37s]  I just don't give a fuck. Oh my God. This is so dumb. Swimming, uh, front to inside.
[16670.09s -> 16684.36s]  Hold on. Just do the, do the back float, man. Back float, back float, back float, back float,
[16684.36s -> 16701.51s]  back float, back float, back float, back float. What the hell? He's not dead. He's fine.
[16702.71s -> 16739.62s]  He's not dead. This is fucked. It's almost my birthday. Building some confidence here.
[16740.18s -> 16765.93s]  I'm good. This is something like, like Wolf of Wall Street shit. Do this before you just buy a
[16765.93s -> 16770.41s]  bunch of options, man. And then yeah, you go lie naked in the fucking water and earn a thunderstorm.
[16783.69s -> 16807.46s]  He looks like a lost whale. I'm good. I am showing off my moves. What? Lork has felt the cool night sea
[16807.46s -> 16815.53s]  against his skin as he pushed through the luminous waves, revitalizing and refreshing.
[16815.53s -> 16850.33s]  Don't look revitalized or refreshed. That's my favorite one. All right. I'm telling you,
[16851.19s -> 16858.54s]  I kind of, I kind of get this. I feel like I would be, I would get so dirt. I would want to go right
[16858.54s -> 16865.37s]  into the shower, right? Like cleaning something really gross. I would want to be just in underwear
[16865.37s -> 16869.83s]  and just, just only underwear and then get right in the shower. I feel like I would get
[16869.91s -> 16879.00s]  all of my clothes and stuff. They just right now go into the shower right now,
[16879.00s -> 16908.49s]  turn, have the shower running, like getting, getting in there. I'm going to go to lifestyle
[16908.49s -> 16941.96s]  coaching. You're like, we probably could use it. You didn't put any clothes on. Oh, I can
[16943.16s -> 16954.31s]  remove this. Should I get rid of this or should I keep it?
[16954.31s -> 17009.54s]  Come on, sing it, sing it. Okay. This rock. I found a rock outside my house. How much do you think
[17009.54s -> 17023.91s]  it's worth? No, he's not calling the rock. He's calling the council of
[17033.16s -> 17056.26s]  Barani. No, I called the geo council. How long is this conversation? Cool. Go pick it up.
[17064.70s -> 17100.01s]  Pick it up. Wait, I can play and I can shower in the rain. Go here. Wait, what's, why is that
[17100.01s -> 17127.40s]  the contextual thing to do? No, you go inside. You go inside. You go inside. Go inside. I don't
[17127.40s -> 17144.68s]  know what you're out here. Go inside. Do I have to work? When do I have to go to work?
[17145.94s -> 17149.30s]  Oh, I got all the time in the world. All right. So what do I, what do I, it's 10 AM.
[17151.46s -> 17158.55s]  Oh my God. I was just literally standing over there. There's another rock out there. Call the
[17158.55s -> 17175.96s]  council.
[17194.97s -> 17210.70s]  All right, we're good. So now what? Try to calm down. Oh, playing in the rain.
[17210.70s -> 17220.38s]  All right. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. That's enough of that. Check your buy mode.
[17220.38s -> 17236.38s]  See if there's anything fun. Oh, good idea. Outdoor stuff. What's like, where are the fun
[17236.38s -> 17250.07s]  things to do? Maybe I invite people over. Outdoor activities. Ooh. Old Timmy's wash tub. Oh,
[17250.07s -> 17285.56s]  there's a fireplace. Okay. I need to put that out. Bees. Whoa. I'm curious. Oh, I'm out of money.
[17285.56s -> 17326.42s]  All right. Let's try this. What do I do? I don't think that was a good idea. I can be a beekeeper.
[17326.42s -> 17357.11s]  I'm quitting my job and being a beekeeper. I can't light this because I'm afraid of fire.
[17357.11s -> 17382.06s]  This was, this would give me like science points. I think this is logic or science, right? Using a
[17382.06s -> 17404.22s]  telescope during the day. Yeah, that's kind of dumb. Oh, I'm still wet. There it is. Logic level
[17404.22s -> 17409.77s]  two. I need level three and I'm focused. I'll get it right here. I'm going to get a snack and come
[17409.77s -> 17425.29s]  back and do it again. Festival of snow. Ooh. Wait, I'll do that in a minute because I need to eat
[17425.29s -> 17436.15s]  first. Actually, there'll be food there. I'm going to sleep for like an hour or two. Go sleep for an
[17436.15s -> 17449.64s]  hour. Quick question. Bob Pancakes and I were planning to spend some casual, you, you just made
[17449.64s -> 17469.38s]  that person's name up. Bob Pancakes? That's a spam phone call. Ah, I want to, there's so much going
[17469.38s -> 17500.97s]  on. I want to do the snow festival. All right. I'll go. I'll go. Is it still under storming?
[17514.76s -> 17595.67s]  Wait, I can get married? Is this my chance? Meet people. I gotta keep my eye on this person.
[17600.02s -> 17607.11s]  Why do you have a knife? Why do you have a knife? Why do you have knives? I have to investigate.
[17611.03s -> 17621.46s]  Why do they all have knives? I need to order something and get some food to me.
[17634.10s -> 17644.42s]  And I need to, we gotta talk. Do they all have knives? What happened to me? You just took my,
[17644.42s -> 17655.48s]  I paid for that. I just paid for that. I just paid for this. This was $50.
[17672.14s -> 17684.86s]  I want 50 bucks. I got $250 from this person. He didn't even know.
[17685.66s -> 17701.70s]  Wait, hold on. Can I, how many times can I do that? How am I hacking him? Hack him?
[17702.66s -> 17704.58s]  Is this Watch Dogs? What am I, how?
[17719.26s -> 17728.41s]  Okay. Give me, I want that. I'm going to throw away in front of you. No, I just cleaned up. It
[17728.41s -> 17735.56s]  was, he finished it. I just, I just look like a fucking, oh my God. I just cleaned up that
[17735.56s -> 17741.16s]  person. I was trying to throw it away in front of him. All right. I'm sick of this guy. No,
[17741.16s -> 17749.80s]  no, we're going to let it slide. We're going to let it slide. I have to make some relationships
[17749.80s -> 17759.56s]  here. I'm just going to friendly introduction. They're all carrying knives.
[17760.20s -> 17767.11s]  I'm just trying to meet people. Okay.
[17776.79s -> 17783.21s]  Let's just, I'm just going to talk here. Mention flirty festival vibe.
[17784.25s -> 17788.25s]  Describe flirty dream. Joke about getting together. Throw petals. I'm just going to
[17788.25s -> 17793.96s]  throw petals in here. It's just going to be like, oh, it's the festival, right?
[17799.62s -> 17806.36s]  Okay. I would like to order a puffer fish, please. And hopefully somebody doesn't take
[17806.36s -> 17818.65s]  it from me. If they do, they get slapped. Thank you. Wait a minute.
[17838.82s -> 17840.18s]  I'm thinking about it.
[17840.18s -> 17848.20s]  This guy right here.
[17858.82s -> 17872.34s]  So I have, so, okay. More choices. Animalistic murders. Okay. So enable disabled non-deadly.
[17872.42s -> 17881.38s]  So they already can do the non-deadly stuff if they feel like it, but not just killing people.
[17886.98s -> 17890.78s]  Yeah. What the fuck?

[18342.23s -> 18347.03s]  fucking that guy's immune to everything. I tried to poison that guy and he was completely immune
[18347.03s -> 18352.34s]  and then I tried to crush his head with my butt cheeks and it didn't work and he read what he
[18352.34s -> 18364.06s]  said. This man right here tried to sexually harass me. This is not even the same guy.
[18365.70s -> 18379.53s]  This is a different guy. What did I do to this guy? What? I don't know what happened there.
[18385.78s -> 18404.82s]  That was fucking crazy. He witnessed it. Dude, that full kick. I almost need to like watch that

[18501.03s -> 18529.67s]  points. He's the guy with the points. Oh Jesus. I don't even know what I was doing there. I was
[18529.67s -> 18551.74s]  trying to kill the guy. There should be an emote. We'll work on it. Whatever. I'm still here.

[18638.33s -> 18645.34s]  again. We're not doing that one ever again. We're not going to do that one again and I'm going to
[18645.34s -> 18657.27s]  just quickly. I'm going to reload the game because that was very strange and I was imagining I was
[18657.27s -> 18663.29s]  going to jump and just do like a Mario ground pound on his head. That is not what just happened.
[18663.29s -> 18667.86s]  So we're going to go ahead and we're going to go back and I'm just going to go manage the world.
[18669.21s -> 18692.71s]  We saved it. Just go back and leave this space here. Somebody said what the fuck dude. I thought
[18692.71s -> 18697.51s]  it was a Mario ground pound. I thought it was like a butt pound. I didn't think it was like a squisher
[18697.51s -> 18711.48s]  ahead with my butt cheeks to over. I'm sorry about that. We're going to keep on moving. We're going
[18711.48s -> 18717.62s]  to keep. This is what happens when I save. I'm not saving anymore. It was a ground. It was a ground
[18717.62s -> 18722.10s]  pound. It was a yeah just like a you know what I mean like that. That's what I thought. I thought
[18722.10s -> 18735.99s]  it was a and that's not what it was. So we're going to just reload that game that we were just in.
[18735.99s -> 18747.51s]  That was pretty good Yoshi. It says booty face pound. Yeah but I don't know. I don't know what
[18747.51s -> 18773.06s]  it was going to do that. Wait where am I going? Where do I even live? Oh here. The spa is now

[21806.95s -> 21813.06s]  somebody thought this is a shitty party. I just went to one of those party rental websites and

[21822.98s -> 21836.66s]  How much was? Don't give him any money. You already paid. You already. He's.

[21858.50s -> 21869.80s]  I can't believe how shitty this guy really is. All right who's making my cake?
[21880.10s -> 21902.22s]  Ah can you make my cake? Do I? I'll do it. Santa are you just eating sugar butter and eggs?
[21908.65s -> 21916.65s]  You people are moron. You're stupid. This is not worth a thousand dollars.
[21926.10s -> 21932.28s]  Can I finish the cake? Why are we? How many cakes are we making?
[21938.98s -> 21954.26s]  Oh all right. Cake is here. We've got a cake. All right. Add birthday cake candles

[22004.84s -> 22012.89s]  Put it away. Put it away. Put the cake away. Oh no he's gonna get a slice. This is the immune guy.
[22012.89s -> 22023.50s]  This is the immune guy. Put the cake away. That's the immune guy. I didn't even invite this guy.
[22041.85s -> 22043.53s]  Oh no he doesn't have a good look.
[22059.91s -> 22070.76s]  That shit has skulls coming out of it. There were skulls coming out of it.
[22091.18s -> 22094.22s]  This guy's superhuman. He's superhuman.
[22094.22s -> 22107.46s]  He's superhuman. He just kind of. He's fine.
[22133.94s -> 22149.29s]  This party sucks. Oh no is he dead? What happened to him? Nobody's looking.
[22154.30s -> 22182.42s]  Is the DJ here? Is the DJ here? Is the DJ? I hired a DJ.
[22190.41s -> 22191.21s]  Santa's hungry.
[22191.21s -> 22258.52s]  He's like he didn't even die.
[22264.33s -> 22270.98s]  Look at all these bonuses. Oh a pinch of salt and laughter. Cooking memories.
[22271.62s -> 22277.99s]  It made a new good friend. Ah new friends. Shades of short and fried.
[22278.79s -> 22296.12s]  This guy. I'm kicking this guy out.
[22301.40s -> 22311.78s]  No we haven't. You can't leave. We haven't even started our bowling.
[22313.40s -> 22325.40s]  No no. Wait the only. The DJ is the only person that's gonna bowl with me.
[22325.40s -> 22329.70s]  Nobody even danced. Good thing I didn't pay for this.
[22355.54s -> 22364.58s]  We're supposed to be bowling already.
[22370.04s -> 22392.81s]  Do it. Do it. Holy shit dude. Wow. That's it. And it's your turn. It's your turn.
[22392.81s -> 22403.98s]  Thanks for coming to the party. I appreciate the um all the effort.
[22404.62s -> 22409.53s]  Appreciate that. The tunes you play are pretty uh pretty hype.
[22410.65s -> 22416.89s]  Oh man. You know what? Nobody. Nobody can know that I did that fucking poorly.
[22417.45s -> 22422.28s]  You can't tell anybody. Nobody can know how bad that was. I'm sorry.
[22423.16s -> 22425.32s]  Nobody can know. Nobody can know how bad that was.
[22438.87s -> 22502.89s]  This is a force choke. Get out of the tub. Get out of the. Get out of the tub.
[22502.89s -> 22510.14s]  Oh my god. Get. I'm gonna delete this thing. That was a nice bowl.
[22539.94s -> 22540.66s]  What's going on?
[22579.19s -> 22583.43s]  RKO. Why all the rain is causing. She.
[22585.96s -> 22669.75s]  She got burnt by the electronic equipment in the rain. Get up. Get out of. Stop.
[22698.73s -> 22717.37s]  All right. Let me try. All right. It's over. I saved it right before this. Right before I poisoned
[22717.37s -> 22722.95s]  that guy at the party. And I just wanted to see what we get. We get a test for things. Right.
[22722.95s -> 22746.79s]  I need to see what this does. Where is it? Bro. You're baking a cake. Oh I have my birthday cake.
[22747.51s -> 22769.19s]  Wait it's poisoned. Don't eat it. Adulthood. Fulfilling dreams. Planning for retirement.
[22769.27s -> 22775.40s]  Perfect time to start wrapping up those lifelong goals. Oh happy birthday.
[22784.58s -> 22802.44s]  I'll see you later. I'll see you in a couple days.
[22802.44s -> 22820.71s]  I saved it before that. When we come back I'll just do the party. Suffocate what? For money?
[22820.71s -> 22827.77s]  Wait. I have taken it as a hostage.
[22852.73s -> 22862.70s]  Clear up reputation on social media. Suffocate with a diaper. I'm not.
[22864.46s -> 22881.61s]  Hold on to that one. What am I making? Please we need the diaper. You're gonna have to wait
[22881.61s -> 22895.77s]  for that one. I think it's ready. I think you can put it in the oven. What is he doing?
[22898.06s -> 22906.95s]  It's a weed man.
[22918.26s -> 22952.46s]  Is he being electrocuted by this? This is so dangerous.
[22965.85s -> 22993.78s]  Make a wish. What? Why did I age up again? Why did I age up twice? What just happened?
[23006.47s -> 23012.25s]  Oh it's because I'm eating the cake. All right well I got it saved.
[23012.25s -> 23027.00s]  All right. That's a perfect ending. So we're gonna rewind the clock a little bit next time.
[23027.00s -> 23030.60s]  Complete the party. We're not gonna poison anybody. I mean that was pretty wild.
[23032.39s -> 23041.51s]  Next time you'll see me I will be live on Friday. I'll see you guys on Friday. We'll play a couple
[23041.51s -> 23054.90s]  things on Friday. Maybe. I don't know. I think I'm gonna play multi-versus. I think Warner Brothers
[23054.90s -> 23060.81s]  isn't going to sponsor it which is just sick. They've added a ton of shit so we'll probably
[23060.81s -> 23069.69s]  play that for a couple of hours and we'll do something else too. I tell you I definitely
[23069.69s -> 23078.41s]  cannot play the Sims mods during that stream. I don't think so but we'll stream for like five
[23078.41s -> 23084.52s]  or six hours on Friday. We'll start with something and then move to it at the end of the stream.
[23084.52s -> 23100.34s]  In fact there's like four new characters. So I'll see you Friday starting at early early
[23100.34s -> 23110.20s]  right because I have to because wait what time is it it is exactly 7 30 and I just I just dropped
[23110.20s -> 23117.62s]  I just dropped frames right now. I just saw it. So perfect timing. So I'll be starting somewhere
[23117.62s -> 23129.35s]  probably around like same area from 1 o'clock 1 o'clock Pacific. Thanks for watching. That's
[23129.35s -> 23135.86s]  kind of that was a crazy one. Playing this game with mods is always an adventure. I'm glad we got
[23135.86s -> 23141.74s]  to do I'm glad I was alive for more than six hours. I'm happy the internet was fine but we're
[23141.74s -> 23146.65s]  gonna have to stick to the schedule because otherwise I will not be able to do it. I won't
[23146.65s -> 23155.22s]  be able to stream otherwise. So here's your new semi-permanent schedule like starting at 1 p.m.
[23155.22s -> 23174.94s]  and stopping whenever within within six hours. So see you Friday. Thanks for watching and here are
[23174.94s -> 23188.38s]  the credits. See you guys later. Take care of yourselves. What should we do on Friday? I'm
[23188.38s -> 23206.33s]  trying to think. Frog Detective? Actually that's that might not be a that might not be a bad idea.
[23206.33s -> 23225.83s]  I feel like Frog Detective can be done in two three hours right? Maybe. Or Breath of the Wild.
[23225.83s -> 23235.14s]  Breath of the Wild is easy just to jump into. Thanks a lot for the subs. There was a lot of subs
[23235.14s -> 23247.78s]  that came in. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Again I want to make sure I make it clear again. I
[23247.78s -> 23257.27s]  don't shout subs out anymore. I stopped doing that a couple years ago and I've given the reasons a
[23257.27s -> 23284.92s]  few times but I really do appreciate it nonetheless. Thank you so much. It means a lot. Play NeonWay?
[23284.92s -> 23299.50s]  What's the reason? I'll go over it in in 30 seconds. So I wanted to remove I wanted to remove
[23299.50s -> 23307.46s]  any incentive to giving money to the stream essentially. And shouting out and thanking subs
[23307.46s -> 23313.62s]  especially ones where it's a lot. I just don't want to incentivize people to just
[23313.62s -> 23319.34s]  dump tons and tons of subs and money into the stream and kind of almost this is not what people
[23319.34s -> 23326.10s]  are doing right? But effectively I'm gonna say something about it right? People have been
[23326.10s -> 23332.09s]  insanely generous to the stream over the years. I wish I could say more than thank you. But I
[23332.09s -> 23338.44s]  stopped reading donation messages. I stopped doing notifications. If you want to sub to the stream
[23338.44s -> 23347.13s]  I appreciate it. If you don't, you don't have to. I'd rather it be that way and we just kind of hang out
[23347.13s -> 23364.76s]  than do it otherwise. Time's up. Okay there you go. And people do still give a lot of subs and
[23364.76s -> 23368.04s]  I wish there was more I could say than just thank you. That's an insane amount of money to
[23368.04s -> 23378.42s]  give anybody. But I have such attention problems you guys already know it. Another reason too which
[23378.42s -> 23385.22s]  is not as big of a reason but reading sub names and taking my eyes off. Look at how much I can't
[23385.22s -> 23397.70s]  pay attention already. It adds another layer of me losing kind of focus on what I'm looking at.
[23397.70s -> 23407.62s]  And I already have those problems. I said you had the biggest nerd job but I meant it in a loving
[23407.62s -> 23419.50s]  way. No I know I know. We fuck around a lot here don't worry. I get it. But yeah I'll see you guys
[23419.50s -> 23427.59s]  on Friday. Have a great night. Take care of yourselves and have a wonderful rest of your
[23427.59s -> 23434.02s]  evening. See you guys on Friday. Take care. Call your mother. See you soon.
