[1.14s -> 9.86s]  You la. You lose. You laugh. You fuckin lose. You la. You lose. You laugh. You fuckin lose.
[10.42s -> 16.97s]  Ey, what's up. You really late? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll talk about it,
[16.97s -> 53.50s]  I'll explain what's going on here. Let me make a tweet, give me a sec. Okay. You laugh. You lose.
[53.50s -> 57.58s]  You laugh. You fuckin lose. You laugh. You lose. You laugh. You fuckin lose.
[58.38s -> 61.62s]  Sorry, something wrong with me. Hi
[62.50s -> 68.42s]  So you're probably looking for Monster Rancher 2. Sorry that that's not here today. I
[69.02s -> 71.28s]  Saw that house flipper had a major
[71.96s -> 77.90s]  update added a bunch of stuff in a while it's been a year I think since I've played it and
[78.88s -> 86.20s]  As you all know if you're been a watcher of the stream for a long time a house flipper DLC automatically turns the stream on
[86.88s -> 88.26s]  so
[88.26s -> 90.02s]  That's just what's gonna happen
[90.02s -> 98.34s]  But we can play it. It's called luxury DLC. I guess it's huge houses
[98.34s -> 100.34s]  I don't know how long is it gonna take me but
[100.46s -> 107.46s]  It's advertised to be some of the biggest houses. They've ever put in the game. I don't know
[107.98s -> 114.81s]  He hates Monster Rancher. What's your opinion on Alaska's beautiful landscape? Oh, well
[115.49s -> 122.13s]  Flawed watchers skip don't skip any of my content ever
[122.89s -> 127.22s]  Let's be busy. You know got something to do
[127.78s -> 131.50s]  Let me turn my fan on back here
[132.62s -> 136.22s]  By the way, I went through the VOD some of the clips and timestamps
[136.90s -> 141.29s]  Yeah, I've when I saw people randomly writing about my sweaty armpits. I
[143.42s -> 145.42s]  Didn't I was like, what are they? Why are they saying that?
[145.74s -> 147.98s]  That was some of the worst that I've ever seen
[148.82s -> 159.85s]  Somebody threw water at me. There's a you look what you say you laugh you lose. That was toxic
[162.20s -> 165.78s]  Humor is so subjective. I'm surprised that even five of you are here
[166.34s -> 172.05s]  It's one of those things where people just don't think certain things are funny
[172.05s -> 175.81s]  they think certain things are annoying or stupid and some people think things are
[177.05s -> 181.05s]  Dumb some people think those dumb things are funny. Some people think the funny thing is
[182.21s -> 185.64s]  childish
[185.64s -> 190.51s]  Vodwatchers skip everything you wouldn't open up a VOD if you were gonna skip everything
[191.07s -> 195.46s]  What you should say is VOD why I'm not gonna say that because people do it as a joke
[196.02s -> 203.41s]  Wait, all right. Let me let's talk about we're gonna do a content update here. It's content update part of the stream
[204.09s -> 205.90s]  first of all
[205.90s -> 207.90s]  Can you even say hi? I?
[209.86s -> 214.70s]  Invited you over for dinner and you you push the door open you did a little light knock
[214.70s -> 216.86s]  I open the door the door pushes with your hand
[217.46s -> 221.92s]  Where's Monster Rancher? How about like how are my two kids?
[222.48s -> 234.20s]  Yeah, you know Jason and Darcy, you're not gonna talk about my twins. You know, they're they're six
[234.76s -> 239.96s]  so
[240.20s -> 249.74s]  Monster Rancher, how could you say something like that? It's one of the best games ever made you have two kids
[249.74s -> 251.74s]  I thought that that was common knowledge
[252.10s -> 256.64s]  This is surprising to a lot of you somehow
[257.08s -> 261.82s]  Interesting. Okay, so let's do a content update
[262.50s -> 268.91s]  You haven't been paying attention. Wait, how do you you don't think what?
[269.71s -> 271.82s]  How do you not know this?
[271.82s -> 275.55s]  alright, so
[275.55s -> 282.97s]  Content update I got some stuff to talk to you about today. We play house slipper DLC luxury DLC. I'm in a weird mood today
[283.61s -> 287.59s]  It's a full moon one of those big orange moons
[288.39s -> 295.14s]  So we're gonna play that in a couple of days. I'm gonna do a Christmas Eve stream
[295.66s -> 304.72s]  That's right. The first time in a long time. I will be live on Christmas Eve and that stream is going to be a
[305.82s -> 311.76s]  compilation of itch EO games and I get a bunch of them if you have any of your favorites
[312.22s -> 314.98s]  Stuff that you've never played because I've never done that before
[315.62s -> 320.58s]  We're talking the weird creepy scary ones to the funny ones the weird ones
[320.58s -> 322.62s]  I'm gonna put together a little compilation and play them
[322.94s -> 325.30s]  so if you have
[325.30s -> 329.74s]  Recommendations put them in the recommended channel because I'm gonna go through that and I'm gonna just get a bunch of them
[330.18s -> 336.50s]  But make sure but the same rules apply to that recommended channel. Don't just go in there and just put bullshit in it
[337.06s -> 346.99s]  That's Christmas Eve a few days later after the holidays on the 27th. I hope you're writing these now
[347.43s -> 350.40s]  We're going to play organ trader
[351.16s -> 353.17s]  space
[353.17s -> 355.05s]  stocks game
[355.05s -> 360.45s]  It's got a long title. I'm gonna play the or that's been recommended so many times people just want to play it so bad
[360.53s -> 363.05s]  It's a game where you trade alien organs
[363.77s -> 366.22s]  And it's like a stock market simulator
[366.86s -> 375.26s]  People said I it I've got like 30 recommend as just about it and they're like you need to fucking play this game Jeremy
[375.26s -> 382.74s]  Please so we're gonna do that on the 27th and then on the 31st. I'm still hopeful
[384.06s -> 391.89s]  There will be the New Year's Eve stream with the awards and the rumble pretty cool sounds fun
[392.37s -> 397.81s]  You will have that poll to be able to start voting the nominees this year. There were so many
[398.45s -> 400.45s]  It's a process to narrow this all down
[400.97s -> 409.83s]  So once we do that and that's done with on Christmas Eve. I am hoping that after my stream
[409.83s -> 414.77s]  I will be able to tweet out or talk about on Christmas Eve
[414.97s -> 421.53s]  Go vote because the poll is ready and then obviously on New Year's we'll do the rumble and then
[424.97s -> 429.16s]  We're going back to VR the first couple weeks of January
[429.96s -> 433.33s]  Maybe the second or third week of January somewhere in there
[433.33s -> 438.71s]  I'm gonna set the whole VR head set up again, and we're gonna do a couple weeks of VR missed a lot of stuff
[438.71s -> 443.91s]  I know don't get concerned. I know a lot of people just went. Oh, but but what about I'm gonna be fine
[444.39s -> 446.63s]  I'm gonna do some seated VR
[447.43s -> 452.80s]  upstanding VR sprinkled in I promise I won't puke and
[455.43s -> 460.45s]  Then I don't have a hard date for you, but I want you all to be aware of it
[460.97s -> 468.63s]  There's a big stream coming at the end of January that last week of January keep your eye keep your eyes peeled
[468.99s -> 475.48s]  For me to announce a hard date. It is not baseball by the way, and then
[477.27s -> 479.55s]  Baseball is gonna be probably somewhere in March
[479.83s -> 488.52s]  But there is a big stream that I've not talked about that's at that same level. It's gonna be the end of January
[488.52s -> 499.45s]  I can't wait getting any hints. I can't fucking wait for that stream. So there's your
[500.49s -> 512.82s]  Content plan the next month or two and sprinkled in there sprinkled in there be a few more announcements
[513.70s -> 515.10s]  sprinkled in there
[515.10s -> 533.90s]  Still owe us a catboy stream you more concerned about the catboy costume not being put on or more concerned about like the
[534.50s -> 542.82s]  1.7 billion dollars I still owe you you got to pick priorities here. All right, let's play house flipper
[542.98s -> 545.42s]  Yeah, I just want to give it kind of an update on how things are gonna go
[545.94s -> 549.98s]  I'm very excited especially for this stream in January. I think it's gonna be fucking hilarious
[549.98s -> 557.52s]  I hope it is it sounds like it could be fun. I think it's gonna be funny
[557.92s -> 561.62s]  We'll see though because it's not for me to decide
[562.26s -> 566.98s]  Yeah, I might think that but that's for you to decide. So well, I hope that ends up being the case
[567.50s -> 576.28s]  All right, let's go house flipper. The DLC is here make a debt payment program
[577.24s -> 586.50s]  There you go. So if you have never played house flipper go get it right now
[586.50s -> 591.47s]  I had to kind of redo some stuff. You notice I have a half a million dollars
[591.59s -> 599.11s]  That's because I cheated as I haven't opened this game in a year and to do a lot of the luxury stuff
[599.11s -> 602.03s]  I think you need a lot of money. I also missing a tool
[602.07s -> 607.30s]  I don't know what it is. So I know you'd like to make this DLC fun
[607.30s -> 614.42s]  I believe you need to have some money because we did this one, but I don't have this saved
[614.62s -> 624.08s]  You can't even hear anything. There we go. You sound weird today
[629.10s -> 631.58s]  Okay, all right luxury flipper here we go
[631.58s -> 635.76s]  So apparently how this works is we have to do like jobs for luxury clients
[635.94s -> 643.91s]  It looks like the Sims and then I think I don't know. I think we can buy real estate out here
[644.23s -> 648.50s]  You sound fucked up. I was
[649.22s -> 652.92s]  Listen
[652.92s -> 656.76s]  Wiggle your treble in your bass on your computer. When's the last time you did that?
[656.92s -> 659.36s]  Why does everybody blame me for me sounding weird?
[659.64s -> 664.30s]  Have you ever changed the dial on the bass on your on your equalizer?
[664.70s -> 670.08s]  You might be like negative eight bass right now and be like everything sounds like shit
[670.08s -> 680.18s]  How come the whole world sounds like shit? All right, so this is the first client you sound the same. I know I'm just giving that person shit
[680.30s -> 683.92s]  I
[683.92s -> 690.85s]  Changed the bass on your vocal cords. Okay. I mean, you know what? I've never tried
[691.13s -> 695.33s]  Let me see how low I can actually get without making like a funny joke voice
[696.73s -> 699.87s]  Hey, hey, hey
[700.31s -> 704.36s]  Hey, hey
[704.36s -> 713.52s]  Hey, everybody. How are you? Hey everybody. How are you doing? I'm doing really good. How are you? That's not I mean
[713.52s -> 719.43s]  That's kind of weird sounding it kind of got jokey there at the end. Yeah. Hey, hey
[720.11s -> 727.56s]  How do you do a low voice without being jokey it's impossible
[727.96s -> 734.11s]  Okay, I'm on a boat Jimmy took advantage of his father's absence and threw a huge party on the family's yacht
[734.23s -> 738.11s]  He had a great time with his friends which can be proved by the equally great mess
[738.11s -> 746.55s]  They left behind now the young social butterfly needs someone willing to clean it up before his father's return. Fortunately a world's a world tour
[746.95s -> 758.84s]  He's currently on will go for another week or so. We have to clean somebody's boat. Okay
[759.16s -> 763.27s]  Did these these freak me out by the way, I would never want to live on something like this
[763.35s -> 767.48s]  See the windows down there. Don't you feel like if like your PC was down there
[767.48s -> 771.06s]  You're just playing like fortnight and all of a sudden. Thank you. What if like water got in?
[773.30s -> 775.30s]  His voice acting
[782.80s -> 786.32s]  I feel like you'd open up the fucking window and a big wave would crash
[786.96s -> 791.48s]  And hit the window go in the window and like fry your computer and like electrocute you
[799.21s -> 801.84s]  Why is this voice actor
[804.41s -> 807.93s]  Am I timed
[810.89s -> 818.66s]  How much time do I have all pizza on the bed you must you must be 20 pizza on the bed
[821.12s -> 823.12s]  Why would anyone ever do that
[824.44s -> 830.10s]  I don't want to get in trouble. I know you can save my skin
[830.10s -> 834.46s]  I have kind of a messy desk and even back when I was like 18 19 20 21
[835.18s -> 841.04s]  Yeah, I had a kind of a messy room, but I would never put a cooked pizza out of the box in my bed
[841.66s -> 857.76s]  Who would do something like that? All right, dude, you got to do this. I have a thousand dollars. It's like a new area
[857.76s -> 868.62s]  Oh, I thought I could drive around. Okay, so I have to clean this boat. By the way, I have like the Santa pack
[868.98s -> 876.50s]  It was free. I think I don't know if that's accurate. All right, which I just clean the boat was a damage
[876.96s -> 886.40s]  Okay, why don't you take out containers a bunch of a bunch of the baby trays like to separate baby food
[886.72s -> 894.44s]  These are all fine bed between two pizzas is a calzone
[898.79s -> 901.93s]  Nobody does this and if you do no
[902.39s -> 906.57s]  Nobody has a party like this if I went to a party and it looked like wait
[906.81s -> 909.35s]  You can now change the stairs in some houses
[909.71s -> 922.76s]  What do you mean wrong? Would you sit at this fucking table? There's bird shit all over here. Somehow. I don't even know how
[923.04s -> 929.57s]  I'm not gonna sit at this table. I'm okay
[929.57s -> 933.71s]  Maybe I would come to this party, but I would be standing and I'm gonna wear
[934.11s -> 938.93s]  Those little booties that like the calm cast guy puts on his shoes before he comes in your house
[939.07s -> 959.49s]  I'm literally gonna wear those. All right, let's clean it up. It's done. Oh, it's Santa to calm cast guy
[959.75s -> 970.39s]  All right looks fine. Can I get the stain? All right, I got the stain
[971.40s -> 976.76s]  It's probably gonna take like 10 minutes. Not even I love this game
[976.76s -> 990.09s]  I I want to talk to like a psychologist because it has to be a reason it has to be I
[990.41s -> 993.23s]  Don't like doing this shit in real life. I hate it
[993.41s -> 1005.46s]  Why do I think this is cool doing this in this pretend world? It doesn't matter thousand dollar budget
[1005.74s -> 1022.44s]  Does anybody and anybody like in chat kind of a psychologist? Let's get okay. I'll trash first just close
[1022.88s -> 1026.91s]  It's a good stream idea
[1027.23s -> 1032.13s]  No, I
[1032.17s -> 1036.33s]  Don't know. Ooh
[1039.96s -> 1042.80s]  Psychologists here. It's because I missed it the chat went too fast
[1043.00s -> 1053.93s]  You could have just like maybe internalize a lot of things, but it will it would just be real life
[1054.45s -> 1067.71s]  Those cans I love it. So relaxing. It's broken. All right, this shit's broken. All right, sell the electric cooker
[1067.71s -> 1075.18s]  Oh, I don't sell this too. Well, they want a glass mini fridge. Oh
[1075.78s -> 1085.76s]  Okay with the plates get these out of here sell the boat
[1087.05s -> 1092.54s]  I
[1092.54s -> 1100.47s]  Okay, do you can you do an open house on a boat do they do that?
[1100.47s -> 1114.93s]  I feel like that would be so interesting. No, it's a boat. But you know what I mean, though
[1114.93s -> 1123.10s]  I would just go to the boat open house because I've never really been on a boat before
[1123.46s -> 1128.13s]  Well, hold on. That's not true. I've been on a boat before I've been on
[1128.73s -> 1134.60s]  Okay, there's like the Boston Harbor cruise thing count
[1134.68s -> 1144.68s]  Does that count with like the tourist thing where you go go do the harbor cruise?
[1144.72s -> 1153.63s]  I guess it's it's like a 30 40 minute thing. I think it's huge though. It's not like this and I die
[1153.71s -> 1163.54s]  All right. This is almost done. That looks great. Get that dirt off that seat
[1163.54s -> 1171.58s]  What did you did? Did you partake in the Boston Tea Party? I don't know
[1172.27s -> 1178.30s]  Yeah, you dude. No, but like our collective like probably fucking how many people here?
[1179.76s -> 1186.34s]  13,000 people right now. I bet you're like if we mushed up like 5,000 of our DNA
[1186.34s -> 1198.74s]  It probably was like our great-great-great uncle or something. Can I sleep on this way to use?
[1198.90s -> 1210.80s]  Ah, this is kind of nice. You don't need a psychologist to realize that you are zonked
[1210.84s -> 1222.24s]  You're not gonna go to a psychologist and ask the psychologist if I'm high what a waste of time
[1222.60s -> 1235.93s]  All right, that looks good. There's some piece of dirt right here. Whatever it is. Whoa, you can open this see
[1235.93s -> 1240.97s]  I don't want windows. No, I don't like this if there's a high wave or something
[1240.97s -> 1243.33s]  It's gonna just crash in and ruin your fucking like
[1243.97s -> 1248.66s]  Mario Party session you're having I don't think I'd want to do that
[1248.98s -> 1253.50s]  Is it weird that I would want my whole boat to have no windows?
[1253.98s -> 1266.20s]  Whatever like wood or concrete or something. I wouldn't want any windows that you want a submarine
[1266.20s -> 1271.76s]  I think a submarine would be better. I want the whole thing in enclosed
[1271.76s -> 1281.09s]  I want an enclosed space. Look at all this shit. Did they eat up here for like three months?
[1281.09s -> 1298.16s]  I feel like they were shitting in these bags submarine Andy. Okay, I will
[1298.60s -> 1305.41s]  This is cool, right? This is cool, but it's like that only cool thing
[1305.41s -> 1319.91s]  I think about when I think about like a boat. I like I like the water. They're not paying me to redecorate. That's good
[1320.07s -> 1344.53s]  You're a fucking landlubber. What did you say? Say that again? You're a landlubber. Somebody said landlubber
[1344.65s -> 1361.59s]  Why is it called landlubber? Is that because it's landlubber? Is it actually what that is?
[1361.99s -> 1372.31s]  Because sailors wait, what what did I think it was? I don't landlubber
[1372.71s -> 1380.03s]  What was it? I don't know. I didn't think it was landlubber
[1380.03s -> 1384.03s]  I thought it meant like like dweller like land dweller like a lubber
[1384.39s -> 1393.73s]  They done to my father's anchor my friends must have played with it at the party and now it's ruined
[1393.73s -> 1401.68s]  Is this me but I have to renovate this thing you have some tools for that, right?
[1401.84s -> 1405.90s]  No, you're gonna bring this like a clog Smith. I can't do this
[1406.18s -> 1414.78s]  What here's a segment of the furniture to work on first of a renovation is always cleaning the surface of the furniture
[1415.04s -> 1421.25s]  Every material requires a specific tool. This is wood. Oh shit. Oh
[1427.80s -> 1432.60s]  Cool I like this it must be cleaned on every side. Why don't you do it?
[1433.20s -> 1438.80s]  Dad cannot notice any trace of those damages or I'm a goner
[1438.88s -> 1444.56s]  Is dad gonna notice that I have sanded this down to all the way where the stain is gone
[1444.56s -> 1452.38s]  I'm sure he's gonna notice like the the four or five centimeters thinner that this just got
[1452.90s -> 1471.41s]  Hold right mouse button to move the camera. I thought these things were made out of steel not wood wouldn't this thing just float
[1471.89s -> 1483.95s]  What good is a wooden anchor? Am I crazy? What does this made? Is this not made of wood? Oh, this is a decoration
[1483.95s -> 1489.64s]  Okay, I thought this is the anchor. I was like, what the fuck are you doing with this?
[1489.64s -> 1499.35s]  It's not gonna stop like a forty thousand pound boat. They didn't know here
[1504.88s -> 1509.28s]  Okay, first cue. Ooh

[1568.79s -> 1580.98s]  All right, spin it. It still works though. It could be whatever. It's a baby toy
[1585.27s -> 1594.89s]  It is a baby toy that looks good flip it this feels nice though
[1594.89s -> 1601.70s]  I could smell this paint you shouldn't be doing that. But you know what I mean that like fresh it just was painted smell
[1602.10s -> 1610.86s]  Did I miss anything this part? What is this? All right
[1610.86s -> 1614.30s]  This is like the part of the flute like the wood piece you put in your mouth
[1614.82s -> 1618.79s]  Because we could saliva and like soggy and dirty. It's one of the reasons why I never played an instrument

[1712.26s -> 1726.18s]  I want to put it somewhere else like on the bar right in front of the bar and go here stupid
[1726.74s -> 1738.31s]  Replace comment on the bug you swallow. Does it taste better? I said that eight years ago. I said eight
[1738.31s -> 1745.49s]  Yeah, I didn't just didn't just happen last weekend. I don't even remember what you're talking about

[1750.73s -> 1767.74s]  You started about a tweet from like 2012. I think looks good there, but you remembered no
[1767.74s -> 1772.42s]  I didn't you know reason why I remembered is because I got ratioed last week from a tweet. I made in 2012
[1772.86s -> 1786.06s]  Okay, now what? Oh, we're gonna buy the mini fridge. Okay glass mini fridge. Let's do this one a

[1794.98s -> 1801.02s]  Is it weird that every time I just see a mini fridge all I can think about is Red Bull
[1801.54s -> 1816.21s]  The only thing I can think of is an oven. Oh, let's look. I don't care. It's not my house. It gives a shit
[1816.57s -> 1829.04s]  Okay, remove trash. Where's the trash? Oh, this job has to be a hundred percent
[1829.56s -> 1841.01s]  Alright, when do I get to have my mansion? Just try to get like I just want like seagulls to come in her and shit

[1892.40s -> 1894.08s]  Alright, that looks fine
[1894.08s -> 1908.43s]  Close this up. I don't think I've ever met anyone with more plastic bags than you get a canvas bag
[1908.75s -> 1910.99s]  It's way easier. You can put way more shit in it
[1911.27s -> 1917.30s]  You get one of those canvas bags that has like the kind of flat bottom
[1917.82s -> 1920.07s]  Instead of look here's that you want to here you go
[1920.07s -> 1926.26s]  You guys want here's a tactic ready for a tip when you go to the grocery store and you get like
[1926.78s -> 1931.70s]  12 plastic bags that you have to do like a fucking Olympic sport to take into your house
[1932.06s -> 1939.47s]  If you're strong enough to get you know what I'm saying like one bag on pinky one bag on ring finger one bag on middle finger
[1939.47s -> 1942.11s]  One bag on index finger if you can do that
[1942.63s -> 1944.98s]  Just get a canvas bag with the flat bottom
[1944.98s -> 1950.79s]  You can put all four bags worth of shit in that one bag and you can just carry that
[1951.80s -> 1959.98s]  I'm telling you don't you start doing that you don't have to do that weird awkward trip anywhere where
[1960.58s -> 1977.01s]  Some of the bags are heavier and you one of them is too heavy on the pinky and everything nice painting
[1977.29s -> 2002.97s]  Wait, this doesn't look right to me. I'm rearranging this. It's better make the bed. That was easy
[2003.53s -> 2012.50s]  Watch that watch they're gonna be a Bible in one of these. It's a broken mirror. I'm stuck
[2017.30s -> 2036.80s]  Fuck I stuck. All right, whatever who cares. Where's this broken mirror in here? What's broken? This is a mirror. What is this?
[2036.94s -> 2049.94s]  That's weird. I don't like that. Where's this broken mirror? So Oh sell it but it's not broken
[2050.10s -> 2063.43s]  You guys see I don't see a broken mirror. There's not even a mirror. This is like

[2109.02s -> 2116.70s]  Was that what was that?

[2135.79s -> 2151.08s]  Not one single slice has been eaten. All right, we're gonna get some voice acting here. He's gonna be like thanks, man
[2151.08s -> 2161.14s]  I mean if you got a home gym, you're an automatic asshole. I'm gonna have to say it. I'm sorry
[2170.61s -> 2172.61s]  I'm kidding. God

[2210.87s -> 2215.38s]  Let me put this out on the dock so people can watch me work out
[2215.42s -> 2230.61s]  Wasn't that you ten years ago? I didn't have a room in my house
[2230.61s -> 2236.80s]  That was my exercise room. My exercise room was my bedroom. My bedroom was my office
[2236.84s -> 2244.26s]  My office was my gaming den and my gaming dent was where I hung out with my friends and where I hung out with my friends
[2244.26s -> 2265.59s]  It was all the same room. It was very efficient that room fucking stinks. By the way, it smells in that room
[2265.59s -> 2273.38s]  I had to clean it once a week. All right, okay. I gotta stop like making stories up. All right, it's
[2273.98s -> 2277.66s]  Stupid why would I want you guys to think that I'm like disgusting? I don't know
[2277.70s -> 2283.82s]  It's some type of weird defense mechanism where if I tell you I'm gross and weird then like you can't do it
[2283.82s -> 2299.62s]  You can't say it has to be I what am I missing? Oh, these are is this dirty. Is that part of the art?
[2299.66s -> 2314.62s]  All right, this is clean. So what's left? There's nothing left

[2452.54s -> 2454.90s]  I would bring up stuff that I that I had cleaned in the house
[2455.10s -> 2464.10s]  Because in those they do really weird shit in those movies. They'll like power wash the barrels
[2464.34s -> 2473.03s]  I haven't done that in a long time. Oh you power wash the fucking barrels

[2506.61s -> 2509.55s]  And I hope you didn't see it
[2510.07s -> 2512.55s]  There's a literal booger on my hand
[2512.99s -> 2517.22s]  I don't even know how it got there, but it's there and I it may have been on camera
[2517.22s -> 2523.16s]  That's why I have no idea why what happened where somebody just tell me so son
[2523.66s -> 2539.18s]  Where's that last piece of dirt that you're trying to hide from me? It's on the table. Yeah, I'd be like, honey
[2539.18s -> 2540.26s]  You know what?
[2540.26s -> 2545.02s]  The house is so clean. I remember cleaning this house before we left. Let's eat off the floor today

[2595.64s -> 2600.41s]  Oh
[2600.41s -> 2605.27s]  Here I'm not watching the stream right now
[2605.27s -> 2614.05s]  You hold on do something funny so then somebody can clip it so I can see it nothing. Yeah, what changed?
[2614.93s -> 2616.93s]  It's still is a
[2617.41s -> 2627.06s]  The Sun went higher during the day. That's all that changed. This is my ass
[2630.34s -> 2632.76s]  Alright to be fair. I had to load a new save
[2633.42s -> 2639.83s]  Morning a mole has dug its way
[2639.83s -> 2647.60s]  I don't whatever complete each job to unlock new houses for purchase so I can buy the boat now
[2647.96s -> 2664.52s]  Let me see. How much is the boat?
[2666.08s -> 2667.08s]  $563,000
[2667.08s -> 2681.41s]  What why would I ever want that I could buy like a double cheeseburger at McDonald's for 563 years straight
[2681.85s -> 2687.36s]  Times wait, that's wrong. I get I've said that rung
[2687.36s -> 2691.00s]  I could buy a McDouble for McDonald's every single day for
[2691.80s -> 2699.56s]  563 hundred years or something like that. I don't know math is not my strong suit. Alright, what's the next one?
[2699.80s -> 2702.75s]  I'm not buying that. I don't want that fucking dumb thing
[2704.44s -> 2709.84s]  Okay, doesn't everybody say that owns a boat. It's just it's just a hole that you throw money into
[2711.08s -> 2718.43s]  If that's what people say about a boat and then people say oh when you own a home
[2718.93s -> 2724.92s]  I'll be aware when you own a home. You got all kinds of maintenance. You got to do a boat and a home combined
[2726.14s -> 2728.02s]  seems
[2728.02s -> 2736.60s]  Like a lot of money to just put in and throw away at that point
[2736.60s -> 2740.89s]  This should be like just a mechanic that lives in the house with you. Okay a new chapter
[2741.29s -> 2746.89s]  Moonrise Bay welcomes Hiroshi and Yuna with open arms this young couple of computer engineers
[2747.21s -> 2750.45s]  Who both got jobs in town had been looking for a place to make their own
[2750.73s -> 2755.84s]  Help came from friends in the area who offered to sell them their unprofitable printing studio
[2756.04s -> 2760.95s]  Now the newcomers just need a little more help with changing into a living space. All right, let me help you
[2761.19s -> 2774.90s]  I'll never forget when you pushed me off that cruise ship in 98 as a joke

[2804.20s -> 2806.20s]  They're big fans of this game
[2808.56s -> 2814.00s]  More about it when you're done with the cleaning. Wait, so I have to clean and then I have to do a new chapter
[2814.52s -> 2824.39s]  What button do I press? I?
[2824.39s -> 2832.21s]  Get out of here. Oh, just walk. I'm at the wrong. Oh wait

[2849.23s -> 2863.31s]  Okay, you got a pretty good view change that window out. How much do I get for this? Oh my oh wait
[2863.31s -> 2866.71s]  My budget's $26,000. Never mind. I said three
[2870.83s -> 2881.86s]  They're paying they're paying. All right, I was jump the gun on that one. I apologize. I kind of want to dispose of this
[2881.86s -> 2882.14s]  All right
[2882.14s -> 2887.36s]  Do I hold on a minute are they gonna be mad that I'm gonna wipe the paint off?
[2887.80s -> 2895.12s]  Where's that like a don't touch that that adds to like the aesthetic of the apartment, right?
[2895.12s -> 2897.12s]  I feel like that could be like a point of contention
[2897.48s -> 2903.09s]  Who wants pain? I don't know like it's look look at all look though
[2903.09s -> 2908.76s]  It's like look at all the paint on the ground stuff. No, I don't know
[2915.57s -> 2922.42s]  What's this stuff? Why they're just gigantic filters here like water filters these pool filters. What are these?
[2922.42s -> 2936.96s]  All right, let me let me get the shit out of the way. Do you see the new fortnight item shop? I have
[2937.52s -> 2947.94s]  Never opened a fortnight. I don't I've not got that far something always comes up. That's more important
[2947.94s -> 2957.93s]  Isn't this all kind of trash liar? I mean, I've opened the
[2958.89s -> 2970.16s]  EXE file I've never actually gone into a game. I never looked at the store. This is kind of a this is a mess
[2978.05s -> 2980.45s]  This looks like when I close my eyes and put my hands on my eyes
[2980.97s -> 2990.97s]  Stream fortnight for 500k off the debt. The only way I will ever stream fortnight is if I do the fortnight joke
[2991.33s -> 2994.96s]  I'll tell it to you again because I
[2996.59s -> 3004.64s]  Just in case it ever happened. I'm gonna be in like a backwards hat with big sunglasses on in like a
[3005.20s -> 3008.62s]  Like a tank top. I'm gonna be in like a
[3009.38s -> 3014.94s]  Lit up room and in the room. I'm just gonna be sitting there with a vape pen
[3015.22s -> 3021.75s]  Like a big vapor and I'm just gonna vape and play fortnight and I'm gonna have I don't know
[3021.75s -> 3022.91s]  I don't know why I think this is kind of funny
[3022.91s -> 3026.51s]  But I'm gonna make my like I'm gonna put my voice changer on just like a tiny bit
[3026.59s -> 3032.48s]  And just like talk shit to people while I play and slowly over time
[3032.48s -> 3035.76s]  The whole room is gonna like in the face cam is gonna be like face cam at the bottom
[3036.57s -> 3042.37s]  Slowly over time you're gonna notice that it's just like you you can it's starting to get way too foggy in there
[3042.37s -> 3046.01s]  And it's gonna get to a point where you can't see me anymore
[3046.13s -> 3055.15s]  I'm covered in fucking fog and then you're gonna start to hear like the fire alarm and the stream is gonna end
[3055.39s -> 3058.88s]  When like a fireman breaks down the drywall behind me
[3058.88s -> 3068.04s]  I have I've talked about that making that joke for like four years and I've just never done it
[3068.04s -> 3075.04s]  You could probably go back to timestamps of me talking about this from like
[3075.68s -> 3090.70s]  2015 2016 actually this is kind of cool a little like why is there a break room in the apartment?
[3090.70s -> 3100.79s]  Well, cuz it's a I'm just selling all this stuff, right? Yeah, cuz it used to be a

[3262.07s -> 3269.24s]  I'm gonna get roaring applause and then uninstall the game and never open it again. Then after that
[3269.72s -> 3274.72s]  There's a big stream, which you will not have any information on because I'm not gonna give you anything
[3275.60s -> 3282.16s]  Somewhere in like the third or fourth week January. I'll give you a hard date on that when I get it. There's a lot going on

[3312.42s -> 3322.07s]  I just have an entire place. Oh jeez. What about this? All this stuff is it could be repurposed though
[3322.39s -> 3343.95s]  You could like spin this around connect the two pieces and make it a bed. It's called house flipper. I know what it's called
[3343.95s -> 3354.28s]  Oh, yeah, you're condescending little comment. I could never be like that with you guys
[3354.28s -> 3359.21s]  I really don't think I I don't think I could ever actually be like that
[3359.29s -> 3382.56s]  That like kind of makes me feel like bad and like odd I'm stuck in the window more stuff this all
[3384.76s -> 3395.50s]  What I make last time after like they'll do in a little bit of
[3396.18s -> 3399.90s]  Tutorial stuff. I did this saw house, right? I have no idea what I'm gonna do now
[3400.74s -> 3408.15s]  at some point it's gonna be like just improv yell out a few words and
[3408.99s -> 3411.42s]  a place
[3411.46s -> 3418.63s]  And an actor huh?
[3418.95s -> 3420.92s]  snow
[3420.92s -> 3423.12s]  Sheldon from Breaking Bad and
[3427.53s -> 3429.84s]  Doctor's office, okay
[3430.24s -> 3442.70s]  I'll break a big bang theory. All right, so new stairs. I don't know what they like
[3443.34s -> 3464.48s]  Whatever really quick question. Do you think Sheldon would be a meth user?
[3465.34s -> 3471.95s]  Character in Breaking Mad or a meth creator. That's a tricky one. It could go either way
[3471.95s -> 3493.36s]  I have to actually clean this user easy. No, this would scare this shit out of me
[3493.40s -> 3516.82s]  Do you have an idea what this sounds like? It's like that's like loud and scary at your door. Okay. Now we need to do
[3517.42s -> 3523.72s]  Okay, it's time to get some decoration in here sell object. What else?
[3524.72s -> 3543.41s]  But it's so cute hurt in the corner. Thank you. We should have sell the toilet
[3543.41s -> 3546.67s]  Oh, we're not this is not a custom job. I
[3552.21s -> 3564.82s]  What's the point of having a window this window has one purpose and that's to jump up here open it like this
[3565.10s -> 3572.28s]  Crouch lift and fart out of here because you don't want anyone in the house to know you did it this serves no other
[3572.76s -> 3574.12s]  purpose
[3574.12s -> 3592.83s]  It doesn't do anything else. That reminds me the windows that no, I don't why I need to open the whole window
[3593.35s -> 3606.72s]  It's not enough. You can't run away and fart somewhere in this house. It's just a big open room
[3607.04s -> 3615.28s]  There's not even a bathroom. Oh, there is never mind. What no you I don't know. I don't want to know
[3615.60s -> 3624.10s]  Now I'm going like this I'm opening this and I'm gonna stand up here brace my legs here push up and I'm gonna like
[3624.26s -> 3631.69s]  Bart out this corner. I'm gonna count to ten because don't ever count to three or four. It's not enough
[3632.01s -> 3636.00s]  I'm gonna close it and be like, hey, so what's uh, what's going on up here, man?
[3636.36s -> 3650.39s]  Yeah, I'm checking out downstairs pretty it's a pretty slick place. You got here. Wait. Why can't you do that with a regular window?
[3657.28s -> 3658.76s]  because
[3658.76s -> 3663.92s]  No, my point was it's this is the only thing you can do with this window
[3664.48s -> 3667.50s]  Doesn't do anything
[3667.50s -> 3676.24s]  You just sounded 50 years old there for a second. All right, stop distracting me. I've got things to do
[3676.80s -> 3685.92s]  Cell object. All right. We need to modify the walls. We're gonna paint the walls
[3685.92s -> 3709.82s]  I want what they want the walls painted white easy. That's it. Wait, that's all the paint you want on the walls. What?
[3712.40s -> 3718.44s]  That's very weird. Okay. Oh
[3720.13s -> 3726.19s]  All right, what do they want? They want this covered where's this even gonna go?
[3726.47s -> 3731.60s]  All right, if we're gonna go with the they got wood then let's just make it all wood
[3731.92s -> 3745.16s]  I'm so bad at this shit. We're sure this even go
[3745.68s -> 3774.42s]  Okay, standing set. This is where I should put this. This is a weird house. Okay Hubbard
[3774.42s -> 3779.19s]  I don't this I don't care about this is not my house. I don't care
[3787.10s -> 3802.20s]  Why can I ask me against a wall? I have like right here filing cabinet. I don't know. Well, this is the oven
[3802.20s -> 3805.80s]  All right, wouldn't isn't the kitchen supposed to be upstairs?
[3814.03s -> 3824.38s]  The oven right next to the door like this somebody opening up the door. It's just bang. There you are
[3824.38s -> 3839.54s]  I'm in straight to cooking. I actually don't hate it. None of this matters
[3839.54s -> 3842.94s]  We're just trying to blow through this so I can get to the big house so I can get I can actually make my dream house
[3843.34s -> 3847.05s]  It's gonna be a long one today guys. This is not gonna be like a three hour stream
[3847.05s -> 3858.43s]  There's gonna be a long one. Hope you're ready. What a dumb fridge. It looks like a school locker
[3859.03s -> 3874.68s]  What is that? Yeah, I don't care about any of this person shit who?
[3875.20s -> 3882.24s]  It's they can decorate it there you can they can do it their own way
[3882.24s -> 3887.20s]  I'm just putting the stuff they want in the house. This is tutorial Andy shit. I'm out of here

[3910.52s -> 3920.05s]  Oh, you want a nice moss wall it?
[3920.73s -> 3945.90s]  Whatever. All right. I'll put it up here two of these right this house sucks. I don't care how bad this sucks
[3945.90s -> 3951.88s]  I have to how many times I have to make it clear. This is not my house
[3951.88s -> 3992.36s]  I care nothing about it. Why would you look at all this? I don't wouldn't sliding door another wooden sliding door
[3992.52s -> 3997.48s]  Explain it two more times
[3997.48s -> 4010.27s]  You get it. All right, we need
[4012.09s -> 4025.70s]  Another one of these the ambient piano music. Yeah, it's nice. It's quite nice. It's quite nice. Okay double bed teddy
[4025.92s -> 4049.26s]  Where should I put the bed right here? Oh, come on. I can't it's just this just enough room for a bed
[4049.34s -> 4076.76s]  Where's the bed go up here? I feel like lying in this bed. That's fine lay floor tiles light oak mosaic
[4076.76s -> 4098.31s]  And that was already on the ground. This is uglier. He's a kitchen tiles
[4100.70s -> 4102.98s]  I'm just going by what the customer wants me to do
[4102.98s -> 4115.42s]  I I'm not what the customers said to do you and I might think this looks really weird
[4115.66s -> 4124.59s]  Somebody just said I have no confidence. This is not my house
[4124.59s -> 4128.63s]  I'm trying to speedrun this we get to go by the big house so that I can actually do what I want to do
[4128.63s -> 4130.87s]  I want to take down walls. I want to have like a dining room
[4130.87s -> 4133.35s]  I want to have a
[4133.39s -> 4135.39s]  showcase room I want to have a
[4135.79s -> 4140.33s]  Room where I like a game show room like a showcase like prices, right?
[4140.33s -> 4153.16s]  I said that's done up there think of someone else for once in your life people that are moving into this house
[4153.16s -> 4155.83s]  I'm not real. They're
[4155.83s -> 4161.14s]  Imaginated people that the developers made to teach you some of the new things that are in the new update
[4161.14s -> 4166.02s]  I don't care about these imaginary people all I care about is myself in my real imaginary world
[4166.02s -> 4182.50s]  Which is my fake house that I'm about to build because it's me making it got a little heated there. Oh TV
[4188.47s -> 4192.80s]  I put it up there. I can't put it. Oh, it has to be sitting on something
[4192.80s -> 4206.55s]  Oh like this kind of reminds me of the first house everybody makes in the sims
[4206.67s -> 4213.34s]  This big open square and the TV is far away from everything else
[4213.34s -> 4220.27s]  And there's just a big table in the middle and nobody knows shit about how to design cabinets
[4220.27s -> 4232.47s]  So everybody's house looks like this in the sims you guys can all sit there and criticize my choice of cabinets
[4232.73s -> 4255.79s]  Well, we all scroll over that we just scroll by it. What is this? Oh wardrobe? Okay, do these this is a fridge
[4256.15s -> 4267.94s]  No, let's get out. This is the wrong spot. Why is it so dark in here? Oh
[4274.39s -> 4279.73s]  This stuff is cool, but I really don't think I only have enough clothes to fit in the first three
[4280.09s -> 4293.18s]  Then not nothing else will ever be used. Oh get the paint bestie aided a mirror. Oh paint with white cool
[4293.18s -> 4302.51s]  It's dark and hey, how do I go get the paint?
[4303.43s -> 4317.32s]  Bestie is there no light switch to turn these lights on you're now manually breathing. You can't get me with that one
[4317.72s -> 4346.45s]  So dark turn. Oh, there we go shit was already white in here. Oh waste of money waste of money, but it's whiter
[4346.77s -> 4358.44s]  Now you're gonna tell me it's gonna brighten up the room. I don't want to be in a room
[4358.44s -> 4361.74s]  That's this bright white people will see how yellow my teeth are
[4361.74s -> 4375.80s]  Hey for all my friends of that that shave when you get the shaving cream on your face and you go
[4376.08s -> 4379.52s]  My teeth are fucking green. What is going on?
[4379.76s -> 4391.09s]  Y'all know that you look in the mirror you smile
[4391.13s -> 4409.03s]  Why am I teeth like fucking green and gray and shit? I'm telling you it's weird
[4409.03s -> 4432.12s]  I take good care of my teeth, please nobody shaves
[4432.44s -> 4445.44s]  What do you mean nobody shaves here you and what's it? What are you implying? You implying something? What's that supposed to mean?
[4445.44s -> 4467.38s]  I don't care. Oh, wow
[4467.38s -> 4495.32s]  It's important. Yeah, what a makeover. What's the next? Can I buy it now? I can't buy it
[4495.32s -> 4505.55s]  I can only why can I only buy this houseboat? All right. I think this is what we're gonna get a big house
[4505.59s -> 4516.69s]  There's one here. I was the contractors. There's another one somewhere. Well, what's this one business-as-usual?
[4518.00s -> 4521.72s]  Businessman with extraordinary taste wants to have an apartment close to his company headquarters
[4521.96s -> 4528.48s]  Therefore he purchased this one previously owned by a party-loving editor-in-chief of a famous angling magazine
[4529.99s -> 4532.99s]  Coincidentally, it turned out a very special girl officer works nearby
[4533.31s -> 4536.03s]  Christopher already has a list of ideas when it comes to necessary changes
[4536.03s -> 4545.06s]  All right bare minimum bare minimum where we gone the Walker family trusted the wrong people when it came to working on their new home
[4545.50s -> 4553.40s]  Okay, Benjamin a very gentle man didn't manage to keep them in check and his wife Naomi had to step in when she'd gotten back
[4553.40s -> 4557.00s]  From her business trip. She was astonished by the state of the house at this point
[4557.00s -> 4572.07s]  They need a true professional who'll be islanded this one. What happened? What did you would you hire the Tasmanian devil?
[4585.82s -> 4590.78s]  You don't understand he's just purple guy and he's got a big mouth
[4591.78s -> 4596.22s]  His mouth of this mouth is the size of his whole body and he spins and he was holding a hammer
[4596.22s -> 4599.90s]  Could you check if it's still fine? I hid in the bathroom for four hours
[4601.50s -> 4610.05s]  The kitchen it's such a mess all around it also looks like they finished nothing upstairs
[4610.61s -> 4612.78s]  Those will be our personal room
[4613.18s -> 4615.82s]  purple the Tasmanian devil's purple
[4622.59s -> 4626.19s]  Yeah, what what do you mean he's not purple what are you talking about?
[4628.38s -> 4631.50s]  Push the sofa off the ramp. Wait, who did I do this?
[4631.50s -> 4637.39s]  I think me and this guy work for the same company cuz I feel like I did that shit to people when I played this before
[4637.99s -> 4639.98s]  He's brown
[4639.98s -> 4644.95s]  No, the Tasmanian devil is not. What are you talking about?
[4647.18s -> 4664.82s]  Tasmanian devil. Oh, I'm thinking about his there's I'm thinking about his little fucking son. They're a little dizzy from Tiny Toons
[4665.26s -> 4667.26s]  Yeah, I'm thinking about his son
[4667.42s -> 4669.42s]  Yeah
[4669.42s -> 4674.02s]  Whatever wrong animal cares he's literally he's not alright
[4674.02s -> 4677.46s]  I'm gonna I have to shut everybody up cuz I need to put dizzy devil on stream right now
[4677.82s -> 4692.84s]  Is he devil is Tasmanian Tasmanian devil's bastard son or something? I have no idea. What do you mean fake? It's not fake
[4693.16s -> 4705.70s]  I'll show you right now. This is dizzy devil. No, I didn't come up with this in a dream
[4705.70s -> 4707.70s]  This is a character in Tiny Toons
[4708.18s -> 4717.72s]  See, that's who came through their house. This must this means the Tasmanian devil has had sex. Yes
[4717.96s -> 4728.36s]  So if two Tasmanian devil characters have it they did this
[4728.92s -> 4733.46s]  Scream at each other and run around the house and they spin around. How does that happen?
[4733.70s -> 4753.88s]  That's a question of not thought of new topic. Please. Please twitch ban him
[4754.08s -> 4760.10s]  He's the worst thing we talked about on the stream is this is how in quotes
[4760.10s -> 4764.98s]  How does the Tasmanian devil have sex? That's where you draw the line
[4765.46s -> 4774.16s]  The last time I played this game I put a sex swing upstairs. Give me a break
[4774.32s -> 4790.61s]  All right, so they like trash the place. This place is kind of swanky. I like it. Imagine the sounds he would make
[4790.61s -> 4796.61s]  I don't think they would be very different
[4798.48s -> 4802.00s]  It would be different
[4802.20s -> 4826.31s]  Would it be I'm curious
[4826.87s -> 4831.80s]  What does he sound like?
[4833.60s -> 4860.11s]  Hold on he's always home of loose
[4866.54s -> 4870.27s]  Okay, so that's what the Tasmanian devil just sounds like
[4872.43s -> 4882.12s]  So I'm gonna assume it would be a little slower it was a little bit slower it sounds something like this
[4916.07s -> 4923.38s]  Interesting he sounds like the drive-through guy from yesterday
[4931.67s -> 4938.26s]  Oh
[4938.26s -> 4944.60s]  Somebody said clear your history. It's just the Tasmanian devil screaming
[4945.04s -> 4957.97s]  All right for those folks at home if you want go ahead and do your own little fun little project
[4958.73s -> 4963.18s]  just what you do is you take you take what we just did and
[4964.19s -> 4969.99s]  You have you make two of those tracks and then you make pitch one of them up or pitch one of them down doesn't matter
[4970.51s -> 4973.59s]  There I'm not gonna do it here
[4974.11s -> 4991.93s]  Okay, let's let's continue what we're doing do the tutorial I was about to Tasmanian devil
[4991.93s -> 4995.96s]  I was about to scream Tasmanian devil on you. I was gonna drop that on the stream
[4995.96s -> 5005.57s]  I was about to drop right on the stream a full-on Tasmanian devil, but I've talked about it before and I'm not gonna
[5006.86s -> 5011.62s]  Yeah, no, we've done this routine before no, we'll not that last one exactly. But this one
[5012.10s -> 5015.98s]  You cannot do a Tasmanian devil impression
[5016.50s -> 5023.50s]  Unless you go 100% all-in as hard as you can you can't half-ass a Tasmanian devil
[5023.50s -> 5036.94s]  You go all-in or don't do it at all. I'm not doing it. No do it. You got to go all-in do it
[5037.08s -> 5041.26s]  No, I can't I don't have the confidence that I can go all-in right now
[5041.26s -> 5053.10s]  I really don't think I have the confidence to do it right this minute. All right, let's modify. Let's hold on so much trash everywhere
[5053.54s -> 5066.76s]  This is really pretty do it. We need to sample it. You're not sampling shit
[5067.16s -> 5068.80s]  by the way
[5068.80s -> 5081.68s]  Buddy, I mean enough to clean the windows anymore. I will just do the bathroom first. We're here
[5082.28s -> 5083.76s]  It's clean
[5083.76s -> 5087.24s]  Alright, they want to remove trash. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine
[5087.76s -> 5099.86s]  Alright, they want to do wall tiles at these wall tiles. What are these? Oh, I like this. This is smoky
[5100.22s -> 5103.42s]  I'm not your buddy. Alright pal
[5109.22s -> 5110.58s]  Okay, pal
[5110.62s -> 5134.29s]  Settle down. Hey friendo sans no
[5134.57s -> 5140.42s]  Wait, do you you actually have the clip you already? Alright, so how long ago is this?
[5140.62s -> 5145.46s]  This clip that you're about to hear was from like a year or two ago
[5145.46s -> 5150.98s]  A lot of you guys might not have heard it. This is me trying to do the Tasmanian devil going all-in
[5155.56s -> 5160.07s]  You can't do it and and I laughed at the end
[5164.58s -> 5174.15s]  Yeah, it's impossible I did it again after that I did you have a
[5174.81s -> 5183.30s]  Documented evidence of me doing it again. Why did I do it twice? What I have to do?
[5183.62s -> 5192.54s]  Alright snowy marble and oh they want both. Oh, I see what you're trying to do here. That one wasn't good
[5192.54s -> 5209.93s]  That was not the real attempt. What was that? That was it's inside the window. I
[5210.74s -> 5214.96s]  Thought I don't know why I just thought somebody shot me the gun. I don't know why it was weird
[5215.60s -> 5225.93s]  Big stream in January. Alright, there you go. There you go. You got it. It was two years ago. Wait, hold on
[5226.17s -> 5230.84s]  Are these different streams?
[5231.96s -> 5237.08s]  Wait, did I do this on two separate streams like more than like six months apart? I
[5249.64s -> 5262.53s]  Can't do it again, you need to slow this down. No, I hold on. Should I try it again?
[5262.93s -> 5272.77s]  Hold on. I have to let me hold on a bit. If I cheat I could probably get it. Let me let me cheat
[5273.98s -> 5276.99s]  I'll cheat. I'll see if I can get it
[5277.75s -> 5283.80s]  This other in the world of voice work. They they do this stuff. Okay, third time's a charm. Here we go
[5286.13s -> 5288.50s]  I
[5294.59s -> 5298.32s]  Not doing it with a face cam, are you kidding me? No
[5300.14s -> 5308.74s]  Mute this mute this because I want to be able to have this as a I don't want you to have any sound in the background
[5321.32s -> 5323.32s]  Okay, I'm gonna pass out
[5324.18s -> 5329.34s]  All right. I'm okay. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm okay. How did that one sound?
[5329.82s -> 5331.34s]  That one's not okay
[5331.34s -> 5345.53s]  Was that one better than the other ones? I hear it. What do you mean fecal funny?
[5345.53s -> 5349.21s]  That's the Tasmanian devil sticks his tongue out at the end and goes with his tongue
[5349.65s -> 5363.33s]  Was that better than the last one was it unironically good? I know are you kidding me? No mute this
[5363.69s -> 5368.17s]  Mute this because I want to be able to have this as a I don't want you to have any sound in the background
[5368.49s -> 5375.19s]  Well, I have sound
[5377.19s -> 5381.86s]  No, I don't think that was really I don't think that was good. I don't think that was good
[5381.86s -> 5383.86s]  That was even close
[5384.10s -> 5393.95s]  Just the guy from Star Wars. That was the frog guy from Star Wars. That was not the Tasmanian devil
[5396.26s -> 5402.40s]  I was just shaking my face. That was not even close not even close
[5405.28s -> 5407.28s]  That's not even fucking close
[5409.08s -> 5412.20s]  Yeah from the Phantom Menace
[5413.60s -> 5423.51s]  Because listen to the other one the other one is so much better because the Tasmanian devil has a very distinct he goes like
[5426.71s -> 5432.00s]  Right and it's all over the place
[5433.28s -> 5450.71s]  See like the pitch changes and stuff. This is just me shaking my face and screaming play them together. It will be perfect
[5450.71s -> 5454.57s]  Oh my god, you're right. It actually would be I gotta get this cute up
[5458.64s -> 5464.40s]  Okay, I'm done. We're not doing this anymore
[5464.92s -> 5474.70s]  No, I'm not gonna you want to go all in you're arguing with yourself, okay, I
[5476.27s -> 5481.71s]  Do dizzy this time? Wait dizzy is different. Hold on. I'm curious. Don't leave. Please don't leave
[5484.81s -> 5501.80s]  Maybe I could do dizzy better. No, is he devil? Oh
[5516.08s -> 5521.32s]  Yeah, I can't go all the way
[5530.00s -> 5540.67s]  Is he devil sound I need to find a good one
[5540.71s -> 5554.75s]  Oh, why is there no audio of dizzy devil, but there's a million of Tasmanian devil dizzy devil
[5555.59s -> 5556.59s]  tornado
[5556.59s -> 5561.58s]  All there is it's like a wiki page
[5563.32s -> 5568.50s]  and just take the guy that all there is that I can find in like the video section is the
[5569.44s -> 5579.56s]  Tasmanian devil dizzy devil tornado and then the guy that does this with the tornado behind him this thing that like
[5580.08s -> 5584.49s]  You know what? I'm talking about. That's the only thing I can find
[5585.01s -> 5613.56s]  All right, I'm done. That was fun. I like cracked my back doing that. I like feels good. We're stream 2021
[5613.56s -> 5618.66s]  Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here
[5618.66s -> 5642.63s]  Get out of here and ban them. Let's put the bathroom in. All right, we need to put a
[5644.36s -> 5647.76s]  Delicate bathtub. Ooh
[5649.12s -> 5670.84s]  No, don't do it. There's already too many of those this thing's huge what this thing's weird. Very nice. Very nice
[5671.08s -> 5683.72s]  There's the walls you lunatic. No, I don't care. I'm just trying to unlock stuff. We're just getting for only 60%
[5683.72s -> 5689.23s]  That's it. It's banned people
[5690.16s -> 5693.43s]  Well, you don't have to okay
[5693.87s -> 5695.75s]  compact
[5695.75s -> 5703.72s]  What was that compact WC enu? Oh, it's a toilet. I might as well have it match
[5716.69s -> 5729.20s]  Mountable shower. How about this one? How am I supposed to put this? I might do this. Oh, okay
[5729.20s -> 5751.50s]  Let's get out of the way right in the corner. Oh, I would love to mount a shower here. I do this wrong
[5751.54s -> 5786.28s]  Oh put it together. Very nice. There might do a teehee for us. I already did. Ah, I'm good
[5786.48s -> 5811.86s]  Actually, I like the sounds this make sounds really nice. It'll like ring ring ring. This is on easy mode
[5811.86s -> 5813.86s]  You can actually put this on hard and I think it takes a lot longer
[5814.18s -> 5833.14s]  Cool. All right. Now they want a mirror a mirror and Lamont here
[5833.66s -> 5850.33s]  Mirror Lamont, I think a good beach finish. Sounds good. I want a TV. That's a pretty that would be like that'd be awesome
[5850.33s -> 5854.41s]  Just had a TV right here to me. Oh, there's mirrors, right?
[5854.41s -> 5874.75s]  So yeah, I wouldn't want this is not where I want that. What would the purpose of a mirror right here be still watch?
[5875.91s -> 5895.68s]  Yourself, where's the sink gonna go right here sink that not a sink. We're not doing a double sink
[5895.68s -> 5944.20s]  Are we he's wrong off-center? It's not my house. Okay, and this fit this mirror is not big enough
[5944.20s -> 5948.98s]  All right. Now we need to lay floor tiles
[5949.82s -> 5955.05s]  These ones sounds good. This is actually looking really nice
[5956.80s -> 5972.64s]  What happened it's the same
[5973.16s -> 5982.88s]  Minecraft power. This is a Minecraft bathroom. I do this wrong lay wall tiles
[5983.04s -> 6000.20s]  They don't want these on the ground. These are floor tiles. Did I do the wrong thing or is it just this ugly? No
[6000.20s -> 6021.27s]  It is like this. I don't know looks exactly the same five nights at Freddy's flashlight
[6021.29s -> 6042.36s]  It actually is how do you come up with that? That's so clever. It's just the unity light
[6045.99s -> 6047.99s]  Isn't five nights at Freddy's made in
[6049.94s -> 6054.84s]  Out of stone or something. It's not even made in regular game engine
[6054.84s -> 6072.82s]  I thought the original five nights at Freddy's was made in some weird game maker. Wasn't it? It's not made in unity
[6072.82s -> 6084.64s]  It was made in fusion. Yeah, this how this bathroom gives me anxiety. I don't like it
[6086.69s -> 6099.83s]  Hey, I'm bumpy. Hey, I'm bumping you know, I don't gotta live here. Hey, that's not I don't what all right bathrooms done
[6100.63s -> 6129.54s]  Wait hangar a little towel rack. I I want one of these I don't want like three of them Christmas is coming. That's right
[6129.54s -> 6133.83s]  I
[6168.73s -> 6182.85s]  Go you scared the shit out of me. Yep. Well the paper. Okay what this is that?
[6182.85s -> 6189.74s]  I was wondering what this was like a coat rack. I thought this was like a fireplace thing. This is for toilet paper
[6189.78s -> 6191.18s]  I'm gonna knock this over
[6191.18s -> 6196.97s]  You are going to reach for this and knock this over and get pissed cuz then the toilet paper hits the ground
[6197.29s -> 6202.73s]  Why that takes up so much space?
[6202.73s -> 6224.10s]  There's a backpack this looked like a backpack from here. The counter is not big enough
[6224.10s -> 6245.32s]  I just I just had to blink a few times did that freak anybody else out to that was weird like opening it with the door
[6245.32s -> 6252.20s]  Moving because I still had it selected. That was kind of odd looking wasn't it? All right, this
[6252.70s -> 6254.70s]  This room is done. I don't need to do any more
[6255.26s -> 6272.02s]  Just got to get to the progress and that's it this out of here the door isn't lined up idiot
[6280.17s -> 6282.17s]  The door is not lined up
[6282.49s -> 6316.66s]  Oh, no, I get no I don't get much more joy in life and watching a stadium full of 15,000 people
[6320.10s -> 6325.00s]  Think that something's wrong with me. All right
[6325.92s -> 6347.07s]  This looks nice sure cuz I'm not like this over this one. Why is it?
[6350.39s -> 6375.35s]  Hello, this must be inspiration bubbles. Why I don't get it. I guess looks all right. He's sitting on the stage. Wait, hold on
[6375.35s -> 6378.95s]  He's sitting on the stage with his PC set up with a spotlight on top of them
[6378.95s -> 6385.50s]  Oh 15,000 people just watch and throw popcorn at him. I think the more accurate thing would be
[6386.74s -> 6389.82s]  Half of you are on your phones
[6389.86s -> 6399.50s]  Watching someone else. I don't know why I sometimes I feel like you you're like the big grudging
[6399.50s -> 6405.02s]  You're like the begrudging husband that went to the show and you got to catch the game
[6406.38s -> 6409.94s]  You just like have me open the tab and you're doing something else
[6410.14s -> 6434.20s]  You got like the Golden Knights game on like in on your lap while you're at the show really cool. Okay, who's a wall finish?
[6434.52s -> 6447.69s]  Hmm, but this one not my house who cares remember likes hockey. No, I just pretend to to lift and uber drivers
[6448.05s -> 6474.71s]  Hey, I need more of these. Oh a big leather chair right here

[6498.70s -> 6507.90s]  Name one team in the English Premier League. I wouldn't be able to tell you and it's gonna matter
[6507.90s -> 6524.60s]  How many like teeth you pulled out? I wouldn't be able to die. I don't know. This looks nice
[6524.60s -> 6536.18s]  I'm gonna really like I'm a happy mood right now. Hope you guys are doing good. It's like the holiday season
[6536.18s -> 6545.92s]  I'm trying I'm just I'm in the crowd. I'm in the Christmas spirit. How are you? How are you actually you doing?
[6545.92s -> 6568.42s]  All right, hopefully you're doing okay
[6568.46s -> 6573.90s]  Alright, it's a room that you turn in and there's like the Resident Evil character that just sits there and watches you and has a few
[6573.90s -> 6592.24s]  Pieces of dialogue for you. Okay, this one's pretty good. Just gotta get to 65%
[6592.76s -> 6607.38s]  Chat and Jerma, I guess I just got the new Xbox hog. Nice. All right. Nice new Xbox in the chat
[6607.38s -> 6617.08s]  We got somebody with a new Xbox. All right, where there's got to be something
[6617.08s -> 6621.59s]  That's really awful to get a bunch of points here or the garage or something, right? Oh, yeah
[6621.59s -> 6641.58s]  Like this is what's bringing my score down. No good. Congratulations broken glass get it
[6650.07s -> 6653.78s]  I was like a great news my
[6653.82s -> 6667.09s]  Sandwich is toasted and it's buttery. It's flaky. Good melted cheese perfectly, dude. Perfect cheese melt
[6667.09s -> 6671.49s]  That's pogs. Let's see pogs and chaplains for perfect melted cheddar cheese on this turkey and cheese sandwich

[6685.05s -> 6701.26s]  Yeah, that's fine getting there upstairs. I haven't done anything. I've done a lot of things upstairs

[6773.79s -> 6789.94s]  I know there's a huge one over the huge one. All right, if I get the huge house
[6789.94s -> 6812.74s]  I'm just gonna make a gigantic comedy theater. I'm gonna it's gonna be a theater. Okay install panels
[6812.94s -> 6830.13s]  Okay, wait put the wrong thing in her shit. Oh, well, uh, it's fine
[6830.21s -> 6848.46s]  He's the kind of aisles you see on the floor where when you're doing the tour or if you're looking around and you see
[6848.46s -> 6850.70s]  Wow, these are beautiful. Wow. Look, I love that tile
[6851.02s -> 6864.54s]  You were you're gonna replace that the second you move in it's actually gonna be first on the list. That it
[6865.54s -> 6894.01s]  So panel I need to install new panels with a yonky splonky now. No, thanks put on some other music
[6895.43s -> 6914.79s]  Do you have anything to recommend? I think this is pleasant. It's pleasant. What's your best half-life to impersonation?
[6917.43s -> 6922.94s]  That my computer just crashed
[6923.06s -> 6940.66s]  Alright, this is not the impression hour. I'm gonna play the game. I'm just that I'm just the kid at lunch
[6940.66s -> 6948.97s]  I forgot I've talked about it about I'm this time the kid at lunch. Hey, Jeremy do do it. Can you do an owl?
[6951.45s -> 6957.03s]  And everybody laughs now do a wolf
[6958.15s -> 6961.57s]  And then I get detention I get in trouble
[6962.41s -> 6968.79s]  You don't get in trouble. I'm the one that has to take the the blow there. I have to hold the burden
[6974.79s -> 7001.07s]  Because mrs. Stephenson is going over the test results. I have to stay after kind of burnt. That's good enough
[7001.07s -> 7032.18s]  I'm not gonna fit a fridge in here. I'm just doing for the points. Trust me. I'm just trying to unlock
[7032.46s -> 7036.68s]  I'm gonna get to the point where I unlock the house that I want to use and
[7037.08s -> 7067.33s]  I'm gonna streams gonna be over. How close am I what's the next big game? You're looking forward to probably Elden Ring
[7067.39s -> 7080.79s]  That's the easy answer. I'm scared though, cuz that's every single person says that and
[7083.15s -> 7089.23s]  The more that people collectively in their brain internalize how excited they are about a thing that comes out
[7089.47s -> 7092.82s]  It usually increases the chance that it's gonna be bad
[7093.22s -> 7102.05s]  The universe does this weird thing the more that people care about something before it releases the worst they decide to make it
[7102.45s -> 7108.14s]  No, I'm not trying to get too excited about it
[7121.86s -> 7128.45s]  Cyberpunk yeah, although who knows this might be a no man's sky
[7129.89s -> 7131.25s]  scenario and
[7131.25s -> 7147.26s]  Two years from now cyberpunk is an amazing game. It could be do you believe in ghosts?
[7147.70s -> 7151.95s]  Um, I believe in radiators
[7151.95s -> 7157.62s]  Faulty hot water heaters add radio signals and
[7159.90s -> 7167.72s]  Wind that's strong enough to make the windows move around but that answers your question
[7168.04s -> 7192.46s]  All right, you want a vial damn right side shower and do that. I don't know about ghosts
[7192.46s -> 7213.16s]  No, I don't know about ghosts too. Too many people have died
[7213.48s -> 7221.24s]  All you would hear was the noise you hear at a baseball game
[7221.60s -> 7234.23s]  If there are people like our ghosts and they're just walking around just like kind of floating around they would be like
[7234.79s -> 7239.26s]  70 billion ghosts
[7239.30s -> 7266.31s]  70 billion ghosts just all talking over each other. I get rid of these you believe in the Power Rangers
[7266.47s -> 7275.26s]  Yes, I do because the Power Rangers are real even though there are a fictional group of characters
[7275.26s -> 7278.34s]  They're actually in the costumes and they're actually pretending to fight stuff
[7278.34s -> 7290.79s]  I've had an experience with a Power Ranger before right? I've seen a Power Ranger. I've never had an experience with a ghost and
[7292.68s -> 7316.28s]  I'm just realizing what I'm doing here. Okay, look Ben. That's about your experience with a Power Ranger. I don't like
[7317.24s -> 7319.76s]  I'm watching the show buying the toys
[7320.28s -> 7346.88s]  Going to Power Ranger con and buying tickets for every panel. See if ghosts had a comic con panels
[7346.88s -> 7355.93s]  I would probably believe more your theory of Power Rangers aren't real but ghosts aren't either then or something
[7355.93s -> 7376.48s]  I don't know. Do you believe in aliens that one's tougher because on one hand?
[7376.48s -> 7381.63s]  Yes, I do
[7381.63s -> 7387.60s]  Do I think that there is somewhere some a galaxy or something that has sentient life? Probably
[7387.60s -> 7389.84s]  I mean if we exist then other people could exist too
[7389.84s -> 7398.94s]  I follow by the we exist therefore theory if it happened once it can happen again
[7398.94s -> 7428.94s]  I don't know exactly how accurate that is, but you never know. I'm speedrunning trust me
[7428.98s -> 7438.14s]  But you don't want these down here. Yeah, you do. Okay
[7438.22s -> 7455.97s]  I'm just trying to get to the big big house as fast as I can. I want to do my own work
[7455.97s -> 7463.15s]  I don't want to work or someone else to do. I know I want to do my own work. It's close
[7463.15s -> 7463.71s]  All right
[7463.71s -> 7487.86s]  What room has not even been touched yet right here some work is the universe where you work a nine-to-five and you aren't insane
[7487.86s -> 7534.25s]  What do you think I'm insane you are? Yeah, say that to me in real life and I'll run bro. I'm running almost there
[7543.08s -> 7547.79s]  Now you said to me. I'm the coward
[7547.79s -> 7563.00s]  I I'm the guy and then beauty the beast that hides behind Gaston. I actually don't hate this room
[7563.00s -> 7574.94s]  Even though it sucks. Oh my god. Look at how depressing this is for me. Just hold on. Whoa, just think one day
[7574.94s -> 7579.91s]  Germa won't be popular. He'll just be another old guy in the supermarket
[7579.95s -> 7586.38s]  We might not even recognize him in the future. Holy shit Wow
[7591.34s -> 7606.34s]  That is that's a sad I just got like a weird image of me pushing a super like a cart
[7606.38s -> 7616.61s]  We get old just kind of looking at the sails and stuff and being like well
[7616.61s -> 7629.58s]  that's that's all those grapes are on sale and then I get to the counter and I'm just like
[7630.82s -> 7648.32s]  And my teeth like both my dentures fell out excuse me, we're almost there
[7648.32s -> 7651.64s]  I bet you the big house is next and I can't wait
[7655.17s -> 7664.68s]  What about in? All right. Yeah, I'll do this. She's got a paint after painting these walls. It should be good
[7664.88s -> 7679.37s]  Don't stop this is wicked sad. I know I'm this is sad and sad music playing too
[7679.37s -> 7692.52s]  Don't you see me holding the grapes which stringy hair with this music and on the front of the package
[7692.52s -> 7699.17s]  It's some motto. It's like and look at me. I guarantee these are freshest grapes
[7699.17s -> 7704.78s]  You'll ever see that's me holding and I smile a little bit and I look at me. Yeah. Yeah
[7719.45s -> 7732.17s]  Alright, this is actually kind of sad. I'm not gonna do this anymore. This is sad. No more of this. I'm crying
[7732.17s -> 7760.81s]  Don't cry almost at that threshold. Come on Gwyn. Let's see it. Come on. We'll be that old in 25 years
[7761.17s -> 7767.39s]  Yeah, 24 years is a long time. That's a long time
[7767.39s -> 7777.80s]  Think about years of your life and how much of it you've lived but how much of it have you actually lived how much
[7777.80s -> 7783.78s]  Have you truly been a sentient person that had decision-making skills?
[7783.78s -> 7792.96s]  I think under 10 years old you don't even know like you don't even really know you're a person under 5
[7793.24s -> 7799.86s]  Right, you don't really start making like actual kind of memories that you hold on to till you're over 5 to 10 years old
[7799.86s -> 7803.36s]  So your first 10 years you barely even have lived it
[7803.36s -> 7815.56s]  So I think about going from like 10 did like 15 10 to 20 15 to 30 and then like 30 to like 80
[7815.76s -> 7834.71s]  You've got a very long time of being like a sentient person and forget about all the other times sleeping
[7834.71s -> 7847.31s]  Yeah, but you need that you need that to live at what point do you stop being sentient?
[7847.31s -> 7856.86s]  I mean like what brain activity right continues?
[7858.16s -> 7868.64s]  What's the theory there? It kind of freaks me out. It's like your brain still has electrical impulse like activity after you you pass away
[7868.64s -> 7875.57s]  Doesn't it? So what it happens there because your brain slows down. Do you like live for like a
[7876.09s -> 7882.10s]  Hundred million years or something like in your slowed down slow low electrical impulse brain
[7882.10s -> 7902.49s]  So nobody knows that only lasts a couple hours. Well, that only lasts a couple hours to you
[7903.56s -> 7912.15s]  What does that feel like because think about it when you dream you only dream for like five seconds, right?
[7912.33s -> 7922.23s]  But sometimes those dreams feel like you're there for an hour or two. Oh, that's the freaks me out to a point
[7922.23s -> 7926.12s]  Well, like I kind of like the second that I'm dead
[7926.91s -> 7930.19s]  Smash my head with a cinder block crush my head with a cinder block
[7930.19s -> 7934.25s]  I don't want to like live for an eternity in my own weird like electrical impulse brain thing
[7938.16s -> 7940.28s]  Because like what if they do what if they're too cool?
[7940.28s -> 7947.80s]  What if okay in the ten seconds that it takes with like uncle Gary to come up with the cinder block and just crush my head
[7947.80s -> 7954.20s]  I may have lived for a hundred thousand years already in my slowed down electrical impulse kind of
[7954.52s -> 7970.26s]  Passing brain not to mention uncle Gary the people in there, you know, I've only told uncle Gary
[7970.26s -> 7972.22s]  I told this to me uncle Gary
[7972.22s -> 7977.34s]  Make sure would I die make sure I die the second that I have flatline you smash my head with a cinder block Gary
[7977.42s -> 7988.84s]  What are the doctors like? What are you doing? Put that down. That's another hundred thousand years. Yeah, I gotta do this
[7988.94s -> 7998.80s]  What if Gary doesn't finish the job?
[7998.80s -> 8010.98s]  I might live for 500 million years and I'll be sitting there after year number a million
[8010.98s -> 8016.57s]  I'm gonna be like, I don't I don't know what happened. Gary didn't fucking finish the job apparently
[8016.61s -> 8025.36s]  Well, Gary picks up the cinder block and like throws it and then it hits me like the groin
[8025.36s -> 8056.34s]  And it didn't even get the job done and they like they throw them out. Just enjoy eternity. It's a weird thought though
[8056.34s -> 8069.02s]  It really is everywhere at the end of time. I'm so close to being completed here
[8069.06s -> 8079.16s]  What what does house flipper do this to you do just paint the walls because okay, I go off
[8079.16s -> 8081.84s]  I pop the fuck off and I play house flipper. You know why?
[8082.44s -> 8084.76s]  Because it's one of the only times when my brain
[8085.24s -> 8090.20s]  Gets to this is just a background thing going on and it is occupying
[8090.44s -> 8094.08s]  It's occupying the part of my brain, right?
[8094.08s -> 8100.44s]  it's almost like my like the crazy part of my brain now can come out because the part that's that's keeping the
[8100.84s -> 8104.52s]  crazy Gary in there is now being occupied painting walls and
[8104.84s -> 8124.26s]  That's usually the defense please. Oh, right. I did. That's all right
[8135.28s -> 8138.32s]  Just can you imagine?
[8138.32s -> 8140.84s]  Okay, and here it there he drove there he goes
[8140.84s -> 8147.36s]  He's passed and like somebody's picks up a cinder block from behind like the table and it's just like holy shit, bro
[8151.66s -> 8162.15s]  Images insane. Oh, you don't understand. He told me he didn't want to stay stuck in a DMT flooded brain chemical dream
[8162.15s -> 8164.15s]  I had to
[8164.25s -> 8171.13s]  Look, I have it in writing. I sign it with like a blue Crayola crayon
[8171.77s -> 8193.32s]  Alright, what do you got? Just opened up another job. Is it in big house? Oh, come on. Where is it?
[8193.52s -> 8202.59s]  What is this crayon?
[8203.07s -> 8245.40s]  Dnr it's supposed to be three jobs here. Why can't I move? I'm an idiot. Where are these other missions the arrows?
[8245.64s -> 8253.16s]  Yeah, but I I see this one. I see this one this one here. So where's three is one two
[8253.16s -> 8284.42s]  I did that one one two a warehouse for memories. Oh, look at some of these. This is cool

[8359.00s -> 8360.32s]  There's like a thousand clips
[8360.32s -> 8367.86s]  The helicopter is waiting and its engines are still hot. This place looks unacceptable
[8368.50s -> 8374.35s]  You need to clean it thoroughly for furnishings pick something stylish top class

[10235.35s -> 10259.75s]  Don't care. Whatever. This just has the old Turtles vibe to it
[10259.95s -> 10275.38s]  I'm gonna set the end of this and then maybe I'll get to the actual big house

[10487.68s -> 10490.68s]  11 plus years of the same name. I

[10569.88s -> 10584.48s]  Yeah, this looks this is dreary and dark and no no no this big courtyard. Oh, I don't wait
[10584.48s -> 10589.98s]  This is the ticket office. Okay ticket office and then here's the main theater over here

[10608.36s -> 10616.03s]  I'm not gonna fast food restaurant man. All right. This is the ticket office clean this place up
[10616.03s -> 10675.14s]  Oh shit, is you playing phasmophobia now making a cinnamon twist relax. You don't even have you don't have my vision

[10749.07s -> 10761.82s]  Oh the game just kind of did not like it
[10762.50s -> 10776.90s]  It's okay. What did I get? I skilled up. I definitely want mowing speed regulated mowing speed
[10778.70s -> 10787.28s]  Whoops. Oh music. Yeah
[10787.60s -> 10813.27s]  Yep, only forty thousand dollars. How am I gonna buy anything old and some theme? It's a big house
[10813.27s -> 10831.50s]  I don't need to mow the back. No one's going back here. Oh shit. I just ran over a bunch of moles
[10835.21s -> 10843.60s]  That's not good. Oops. I'll lay out because I'm not
[10846.74s -> 10872.75s]  About the mischief makers OST bring it up. That's right. There is when the song goes
[10874.03s -> 10885.54s]  I need to remake this game. They've remade such dog shit in the past. Like why would you don't remake mischief makers?
[10885.98s -> 10908.67s]  Why because it sucks? No, it does not have you played it. You've probably never played it. It's already perfect
[10908.99s -> 10915.74s]  Well, it rerelease it give us some updated input commands and graphics and stuff would just update it
[10927.28s -> 10939.10s]  I'm almost done with the front at least treasure is basically dead
[10940.91s -> 10942.19s]  That's sad
[10942.19s -> 10967.85s]  You ever been to another country? I have not well just Canada count. I don't I don't count Canada. I just don't here comes
[10968.37s -> 10986.03s]  Here it comes. I'm to New Zealand. I'm not just gonna go to New Zealand. Just for no reason
[10986.79s -> 10992.17s]  New Zealand I'm sure is a beautiful place
[10992.85s -> 11007.22s]  That's too far for me to go. All right front yard looks pretty good. I
[11007.94s -> 11023.63s]  Would say so get out of your hobbit hole. Oh, it's warm and this grape jam Gandalf
[11023.63s -> 11034.93s]  I just want my books and my grape jam and my comfortable chair Gandalf. That's true
[11035.45s -> 11058.65s]  Now it's a little loud. Let me fix that. I got you need to come to your senses
[11059.23s -> 11062.49s]  This tree can stay
[11062.49s -> 11076.90s]  Come to Riven dare isn't that like Jughead Jones? All right, we're mode
[11077.66s -> 11104.66s]  Clean. No, we're not. Let's be perfect. You missed an inch wide strip. Who cares?
[11104.66s -> 11111.91s]  I've got a lot of internal work inside the castle to do the outside. I don't really care about
[11111.91s -> 11123.41s]  I just don't want to be look gross. You tell me right here. All right, you know the sledgehammer
[11123.41s -> 11134.61s]  I need to take down so what can you go upstairs into a theater? It was an Edgar Allan Poe or something
[11134.65s -> 11146.41s]  All right, what's up here if I take this wall down much outdoor space here to all this shit
[11146.41s -> 11157.70s]  Oh Gandalf my books. You don't need these anymore
[11160.87s -> 11162.11s]  Gandalf
[11162.11s -> 11165.95s]  All right, old people
[11165.95s -> 11169.73s]  You'll be dead in a few years. Oh
[11182.90s -> 11184.54s]  oh
[11184.54s -> 11211.30s]  Cigarette stains. This is we're gonna turn this around just you wait and see if you come up the stairs here
[11211.30s -> 11238.87s]  What is the whole of the steps we're selling that's not inviting we don't talk about how Gandalf was 80% sure that Bilbo was
[11238.87s -> 11240.23s]  dead on that journey
[11240.23s -> 11257.51s]  Didn't get enough just like smoke a bunch of crack and think that it was a good idea to send a hobbit into Mount
[11257.51s -> 11262.70s]  Doom it just worked somehow like lightning strikes once in a million chance, right?
[11262.70s -> 11270.35s]  I think Gandalf just got lucky. It's remarkable that that worked out
[11270.71s -> 11289.62s]  They even make a point to show Gandalf smoke a bunch of crack like smoke a pipe on camera
[11289.66s -> 11307.30s]  50 times and he sits back and it's like eyes like roll forward and he's just like, oh that scared me
[11307.30s -> 11315.13s]  I was like, oh yawn yawn. What's going this music sucks yawn
[11315.87s -> 11354.89s]  Here comes. All right. I'm I'm taking I think I'm gonna take this wall. Maybe not
[11354.89s -> 11363.80s]  I'm gonna play this game one day on stream. I
[11364.69s -> 11366.69s]  Will I've done it?
[11372.29s -> 11374.97s]  Paging paging everybody that works on the switch
[11376.09s -> 11380.29s]  N64 library put this on there
[11380.29s -> 11399.94s]  I don't have any more pogs left in my body to pretend to be excited about paper Mario. I put something else on there
[11400.40s -> 11411.23s]  It's a great game. It's a great game
[11411.39s -> 11422.80s]  It is it could be one of the greater games that was released on the console. I'm aware of that
[11423.38s -> 11435.73s]  You know what else I'm aware of corporate greed. That's right. Oh, I thought this is meat on here
[11436.35s -> 11443.94s]  Just it's gonna be the concession hall
[11447.99s -> 11450.94s]  You gave into that greed
[11453.32s -> 11470.28s]  Don't say that
[11470.60s -> 11500.69s]  Yeah, this is good shit. What soundtrack is this is mischief makers
[11501.37s -> 11520.75s]  Give it a listen. Go play the game if you can. This is ugly. No get rid of that. What's down here?
[11520.75s -> 11532.78s]  I'm not a person down here, right? Oh
[11538.47s -> 11540.47s]  What did that just make me feel so weird?
[11540.83s -> 11544.77s]  Why is it? Why is it in those weird? I don't like that
[11545.37s -> 11584.17s]  You're to all this this whole wall done get rid of the whole thing. Oh, here's my favorite song take this down to
[11584.65s -> 11587.28s]  And I not go outside
[11588.12s -> 11602.20s]  It's gonna be somebody buried in the wall probably
[11602.92s -> 11624.44s]  Let us keep the horror. It's here on the screen right now all the characters in the game too when you attack them they go
[11626.95s -> 11657.48s]  Okay, it looks good sell everything please help what what's wrong nobody said, please help what am I helping?
[11657.48s -> 11675.68s]  What did you do? What happened? He's not making money doing this, you know, it's statistically possible that somebody may have died right now
[11676.08s -> 11702.74s]  Don't tell me that maybe this could be the theater. I need a big open space
[11703.06s -> 11725.04s]  This is the wall to the outside of the property. You have many viewers
[11725.68s -> 11743.47s]  Thanks, is that a compliment or you mean? I mean if you want to talk about statistics
[11743.47s -> 11750.10s]  I would say if there's like a zero point zero zero zero one percent chance that somebody watching
[11750.62s -> 11757.36s]  You know, it could fall into that category. How many people are actually taking going to the bathroom right now?
[11758.04s -> 11768.77s]  Like they're on the toilet and they're holding like their phone in one hand. I gotta brighten this up a little bit
[11768.77s -> 11776.20s]  This is so ugly. I can't do anything with this space yet
[11776.72s -> 11779.63s]  Remind me it. Oh, I could I could put a bathroom right here. Oh
[11781.17s -> 11792.00s]  No, I could this could be the bathroom. Yeah, I think that's a good place for the restroom
[11792.28s -> 11806.44s]  It's also just am I gonna read what you said because I can put them against the wall. All right, let's let's start
[11806.44s -> 11814.34s]  Let's start the bathroom. I'm looking for floor. I want bathroom floor
[11814.90s -> 11819.44s]  floor tiles, oh
[11822.07s -> 11823.84s]  How about oh
[11823.84s -> 11831.99s]  No too much. How about these? I like it. Oh
[11834.43s -> 11858.80s]  This is gonna be a nice bathroom gonna be this the all the way through though. What the hell is in a public bathroom?
[11859.60s -> 11863.72s]  stalls
[11863.72s -> 11865.86s]  urinals
[11865.86s -> 11887.92s]  Sinks, maybe I should change it out halfway through here. Okay, which I need the walls to be different looking to
[11888.48s -> 11905.05s]  See the bathroom walls look like let me finish this first. It's literally $50 to do this. Who cares?
[11905.05s -> 11907.05s]  I can replace it if I want to
[11907.29s -> 11938.27s]  Do we have a consensus? How many are on the bathroom right now? All right, the walls need to change walls
[11938.79s -> 11946.49s]  Need bathroom walls wall tiles. Maybe some green some blue
[11947.07s -> 11953.07s]  Something that'll brighten up a little bit. This looks all right. Oh
[11957.44s -> 11962.36s]  What about the diamond tiles or these?
[11963.36s -> 11980.80s]  Let me see. Let's see what they look like. I hate that
[11981.28s -> 12003.48s]  Yeah, that looks awful. Just paint it. I'm gonna paint it. Just paint just paint. All right
[12003.48s -> 12027.91s]  I'm thinking that we'll do crystal. This looks like I need something more chill than this. This is too intense
[12027.91s -> 12032.63s]  What should I put on? There's 240 people
[12033.47s -> 12044.67s]  Right now that's so weird think about how many people
[12045.35s -> 12055.09s]  240 is how many people can fit in a movie theater? How many seats are in like an IMAX theater?
[12062.04s -> 12072.94s]  300 240. Yeah, imagine an entire IMAX theater full of people and you you know, they're all going to the bathroom right now
[12072.96s -> 12090.83s]  I'm gonna dress it up. Don't worry. That's gonna get this gaudy wallpaper off. I haven't peed all day either
[12090.83s -> 12109.44s]  So let's do that as well. This is not the main event. I'm just making the bathroom first. So don't forget it
[12109.44s -> 12424.11s]  All right, I'll be right back. I'm gonna go pee back in like two three minutes. Hello
[12424.63s -> 12429.17s]  So I was just downstairs and
[12432.17s -> 12439.85s]  I was walking and I heard a little ruffling. I heard like a little
[12441.21s -> 12443.64s]  What was that?
[12443.64s -> 12448.25s]  All of a sudden I get this wave of baked dog cookies
[12448.53s -> 12458.86s]  Those that savory like baked dog cookies just filled the air. I said, where is he?
[12459.02s -> 12467.02s]  I have no idea. I'm looking around like I get I where it's like somebody lit a
[12467.42s -> 12475.08s]  Savory dog candle down here. I don't know. I can't find him. I look over where he usually is
[12475.08s -> 12482.33s]  I look over in the corner and on his bed. No, look at the couch. There's nothing there
[12482.33s -> 12484.69s]  There's just a really really spun up
[12485.44s -> 12492.54s]  Crumpled up blanket that was on the couch and I go over it. Nobody wait a minute that it's dog shaped
[12492.54s -> 12499.70s]  I go over there and they wait it's I'm sitting right in front of where the smell is
[12499.82s -> 12506.39s]  He has wrapped himself up so much isn't been a blanket. I can't even tell there's a dog on the couch
[12506.47s -> 12515.18s]  I'm telling you it hit me in the face when I was far away from him
[12515.32s -> 12521.61s]  He's a little dog, but he has a big dog smell
[12521.77s -> 12528.52s]  It's so cute and then he let out this huge once he realized that I was in the room
[12528.58s -> 12534.55s]  He let out this just like you know what I'm talking about, right?
[12534.77s -> 12543.16s]  Yeah, he's so wonderful. Give him a bath. I he gets a bath all the time
[12543.32s -> 12558.29s]  He is very thoroughly cleaned on a very regular basis. All right, let's keep going Jerma

[13802.74s -> 13813.10s]  This one's like not even good it was held by auto mod for being bullying
[13819.79s -> 13851.66s]  Okay, here we go

[13911.59s -> 13917.25s]  This is what Jerma does to his friends on discord
[13918.17s -> 13924.87s]  Really does feel like that doesn't it get Freddy get Freddy to write something
[13928.26s -> 13932.85s]  Freddy if Freddy writes me a saw rap, I will do it
[13932.85s -> 13940.57s]  I I will do it in the saw voice. No pressure on Freddy
[13940.57s -> 13945.15s]  By the way, Freddy if you're like, no, I don't want to fucking do that Freddy. You write like a saw rap
[13945.15s -> 13955.97s]  I'll do it and I will release it on stream. You just ruined Freddy's DMS
[13956.97s -> 13980.87s]  No, turn off your DMS Freddy Freddy go private for like a week and then we'll talk post it to the main channel
[13980.87s -> 13994.32s]  No, nothing's to go into the main channel ever again. It has to be a music video
[13994.96s -> 13997.95s]  No, I can't do a music video
[13998.59s -> 14003.07s]  Yeah, January and February is gonna be so busy. I I can't oh
[14015.98s -> 14017.54s]  This is awful
[14017.54s -> 14030.64s]  Okay, I gotta turn the volume back up and we have to put on just some music just regular just kind of hangout music
[14030.68s -> 14039.80s]  No more freestyles. Okay. I'm gonna put like Animal Crossing
[14041.21s -> 14058.25s]  New leaf OST we got to come down from that. That's too. That was too much. I gotta relax held for auto mod for bullying
[14058.25s -> 14061.25s]  That's the like. Oh, yeah, send me your diss tracks
[14061.99s -> 14065.47s]  Excuse me. Don't bully the streamer. That's so funny
[14067.78s -> 14095.40s]  Well, at least I know it works. I'm not gonna put the music on times to speed just okay
[14095.44s -> 14103.46s]  Here's what you can do wait 20 minutes go open up the VOD and then watch this part in times to speed
[14103.66s -> 14120.37s]  You need to talk in half speed to match. Oh, come on
[14120.37s -> 14125.21s]  Don't give me more stupid routines to do now. I have to do this
[14126.96s -> 14138.98s]  So I was thinking of putting white up on the background here
[14139.70s -> 14140.82s]  and
[14140.86s -> 14146.10s]  You guys tell me if you think it's a good enough color
[14146.22s -> 14152.04s]  I think it's gonna look really nice
[14153.26s -> 14159.64s]  Maybe eventually we can put some
[14161.02s -> 14163.42s]  paintings up on the walls. I
[14166.09s -> 14169.01s]  Think that will come out good
[14170.01s -> 14180.42s]  Up stairs, however, I think we have to do something a little more
[14181.66s -> 14186.40s]  elaborate maybe a
[14187.28s -> 14192.08s]  couple of chairs here on either side
[14193.96s -> 14204.69s]  But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here? Oh
[14209.49s -> 14210.69s]  Oh
[14210.69s -> 14213.73s]  This is not the chair
[14215.25s -> 14219.36s]  It's the paint menu
[14227.20s -> 14229.94s]  I
[14229.94s -> 14233.35s]  Think it's over here somewhere
[14234.55s -> 14238.12s]  Let me search for it
[14242.06s -> 14244.42s]  Chai
[14244.94s -> 14247.12s]  I
[14247.32s -> 14255.50s]  That's what I was saying to you earlier
[14256.06s -> 14264.57s]  This one with the green that's gonna look so good here
[14270.38s -> 14276.51s]  Okay, I think I have enough chairs there
[14292.68s -> 14296.90s]  Oh
[14297.86s -> 14304.54s]  Hey, does anybody see the new
[14305.30s -> 14317.29s]  Marvel movie is it any good? Oh wait, I think somebody's texting me
[14319.30s -> 14323.28s]  Feel a sneeze coming on
[14341.74s -> 14354.70s]  All right, all right, I need it clipped given me can somebody do that get that at times two and we I need to watch that right now
[14354.70s -> 14357.76s]  I want to see how close I was. I think I was pretty close
[14357.80s -> 14366.29s]  Can we get that section that like two-minute section there's to see if it was like a full minute of me of normal shit
[14366.37s -> 14386.00s]  You're a psycho. That's fine. You got the whole thing and I do this in times two. Okay speed times two
[14388.15s -> 14390.15s]  upstairs, however, I
[14390.31s -> 14393.06s]  Got it think it works
[14393.34s -> 14410.34s]  Think it works. Hold on. We got it. We got to confirm that this works. All right, it's time
[14410.34s -> 14427.12s]  I think I did a pretty good job that will okay. Let's see how I did that will come out good
[14429.22s -> 14433.66s]  Upstairs, however, I think we have to do something a little more elaborate
[14434.18s -> 14439.10s]  Maybe a couple of chairs here on either side
[14439.58s -> 14444.98s]  But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here? Oh
[14447.62s -> 14452.26s]  This is not the chairs, it's the paint menu
[14456.91s -> 14458.91s]  I
[14458.95s -> 14463.07s]  Think it needs to be a little faster. I think it needs to be like two and a half or three
[14463.07s -> 14472.94s]  I need to see the three sounds like an AI generated voice. I need to see this at three
[14473.94s -> 14478.34s]  Upstairs, however, I alright somebody clip this. No. No, I need the whole thing
[14478.50s -> 14496.28s]  I need the whole thing. I need I need it at times three. Wait, hold on kid. It's too long
[14496.68s -> 14502.09s]  Clip this one and just do alright. Alright, get did you get that? Give it to me
[14502.33s -> 14513.18s]  Give me that what just happened right there and I'm gonna do times one make this. Okay. Here we go
[14513.22s -> 14519.24s]  Let me open this one because this would be times two. There's here on either side
[14519.76s -> 14528.75s]  Okay, so now let's do times times two on this one chairs here on either side. Oh my god. This is fucked
[14528.79s -> 14531.61s]  Okay, this is perfect. I
[14531.77s -> 14553.90s]  Eventually want this whole thing. This is now times four that will come out chairs here. Oh my god, dude
[14553.90s -> 14556.04s]  Are you kidding me? Okay times two
[14556.74s -> 14568.31s]  Chairs here on either side chairs here on either side
[14568.89s -> 14571.29s]  But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here? Oh
[14572.33s -> 14574.89s]  This is not the chairs. It's the paint menu
[14575.57s -> 14580.51s]  Okay, that's a little too fast a little bit and needs to be 1.5
[14581.05s -> 14584.95s]  There's here on either side
[14585.67s -> 14588.63s]  But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here? Oh
[14590.27s -> 14593.69s]  This is not the chairs, it's the paint menu
[14596.47s -> 14597.75s]  I
[14597.75s -> 14600.71s]  Think it needs to be a little faster. What I think it needs to be like two and a half or three
[14600.71s -> 14606.20s]  I'm too fast three. So wait AI generated voice. I
[14609.34s -> 14612.18s]  Want to see the whole thing? It's all right
[14612.82s -> 14619.02s]  See it at three
[14620.34s -> 14625.90s]  That's so stupid nobody all right, somebody download the
[14626.70s -> 14636.36s]  I don't know. It's time to do it in the reverse. Here we go
[14637.46s -> 14646.96s]  Ha ha. I think over here. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Right here. Right here. Here. Here. What should I do?
[14646.96s -> 14651.30s]  I did blue. Should I do this blue this blue right here? Good. Yep
[14652.93s -> 14676.66s]  That's not gonna work. It's too hard to go fast speed this one up chairs here on either side. Oh
[14676.92s -> 14678.14s]  Oh
[14678.14s -> 14686.45s]  This is not the chairs. That was so fucked up. Somebody said Vocaloid
[14687.11s -> 14700.17s]  All right. I'm no more derailing. It's time to play. All right, somebody
[14700.17s -> 14703.55s]  I know somebody on the subreddit in like an hour
[14704.01s -> 14711.55s]  We'll have that whole section sped up to the exact preferences that need to be to make it sound normal and then you'll see it
[14711.55s -> 14722.61s]  You'll see it there later in like an hour. I'm looking forward to it. All right
[14722.61s -> 14725.25s]  I just I was down doing the bathroom. I don't even know where the bathroom is
[14725.25s -> 14730.24s]  It was like underground somewhere. Oh, right. Okay. These are not the chairs
[14730.92s -> 14740.68s]  So I'm thinking
[14740.68s -> 14751.65s]  Hells why even do with this place? I was gonna make a theater, but it's the the castles like too big and weird
[14751.89s -> 14765.51s]  It's too it's like there's too many outdoor areas. You know, I mean
[14776.20s -> 14782.54s]  Just make a counter-strike map I
[14783.10s -> 14807.82s]  Made the FPS house already. I know this dude's actually playing the game. I know what happened. It's a user-made sawdust
[14808.02s -> 14817.33s]  All right
[14817.33s -> 14824.71s]  All right. I'll say this is too much. I'll do this later go back to the funny stuff. No more playing games
[14824.71s -> 14826.75s]  No, we can't it can't just all be
[14827.63s -> 14845.48s]  cartoon world
[14845.72s -> 14848.72s]  Oh music though. Yeah, let's put animal crossing back on
[14850.24s -> 14853.40s]  So now what I was thinking
[14854.68s -> 14858.16s]  Was singing you a little song
[14867.92s -> 14871.35s]  I'm done. I'm kidding. I'm kidding relax. I
[14875.80s -> 14909.73s]  Don't like this place. Yeah, I don't like this house. I want another one. What? Here we go. Here we go
[14910.01s -> 14932.06s]  Okay, I got my money back. Yeah, I don't like that place. Let me find no accept the offer. It's fine

[14983.89s -> 14997.59s]  What can I even do with it though? I feel like I this might be just like the castle though
[14997.59s -> 15009.67s]  No, we already did the boat. This one was kind of cool
[15010.31s -> 15023.82s]  Yeah, I'm gonna buy this one. I did the moon house last time just make a big bird house
[15023.82s -> 15033.85s]  I did the moon one last time. All right now I'm gonna go for it
[15041.20s -> 15054.68s]  Actually gonna play I'm gonna do a regular house with a theater in the middle
[15054.68s -> 15066.52s]  Or maybe I'll just mow the lawn and then do a rap battle with the chat. I don't know. We'll find out

[15591.79s -> 15598.84s]  I like this upstairs. You got to clean first
[15598.84s -> 15611.91s]  That's the most important thing and you just go one by one room by room and make your dream house

[15763.56s -> 15793.88s]  Looks better. Where is it? It's not even on the map. This house is modernist trash
[15802.16s -> 15809.47s]  modernist trash
[15809.47s -> 15812.54s]  Modernist fucking sucks. No. No you guys with this

[15899.39s -> 15928.17s]  I didn't even know he had hair. Hold on. Wait, I didn't he has hair. He does have hair
[15928.21s -> 15930.12s]  All right
[15930.12s -> 15942.18s]  This looks like the episode of the Pringles TV show where he goes back to like the 30s and it's black and white
[15942.18s -> 15955.67s]  I mean who cares
[15956.03s -> 15958.25s]  Care
[15958.25s -> 15965.14s]  There you want my reaction who cares when they change the recipe of Pringles? That's when you'll hear me scream
[15965.18s -> 15975.12s]  They could put they could put clown makeup on him and give him like a big chef's hat
[15975.12s -> 15977.28s]  I don't whatever they taste the same
[15977.28s -> 15988.48s]  I'm just not looking forward if they ever make the Pringles guy a real guy in the commercials
[15988.52s -> 16007.07s]  Be like interesting and funny and shit and it's like a rich guy. I think everything's clean
[16007.15s -> 16009.88s]  I'm gonna go to the living room gonna start living room
[16009.88s -> 16020.71s]  Let's change the stairs to something that is way more tolerable than this. All right. I like a I
[16022.65s -> 16031.34s]  I'm not a big wood guy. I would ruin it. I think it it can be destroyed too easily. I'm like a vinyl
[16032.12s -> 16034.28s]  linoleum tile
[16034.28s -> 16052.31s]  You can just what is expensive and you can fuck it up really easily. Mmm. I don't hate the mahogany
[16052.31s -> 16075.55s]  I don't hate the mahogany and I don't like dark wood. Actually, that's not true. I like um, where's that?
[16075.55s -> 16082.95s]  Where's where's just like the right? All right, that doesn't look bad. This doesn't look bad either. This doesn't look bad
[16082.95s -> 16093.75s]  I'm going with the mahogany. It looks good living room time. What do I want my first of all?
[16093.75s -> 16098.71s]  I gotta get these walls taken care of cuz oh my goodness guys
[16099.15s -> 16109.77s]  What the heck's going on here ain't I like very neutral colors in my living spaces. I'm talking grays
[16109.77s -> 16118.79s]  I'm talking like kind of like olive off white not ever cigarette yellow though
[16118.79s -> 16124.48s]  I don't like a cream yellow. I think it looks like cigarettes like this. No cigarettes
[16124.80s -> 16130.91s]  Steel gray I would like on the wall. Probably. Let me say what it looks like
[16130.91s -> 16154.28s]  I like a neutral living room, although it could be an accent. I have an orange couch. No
[16155.44s -> 16157.39s]  No
[16157.39s -> 16166.65s]  No, it's too neutral. Let me just see what it looks like
[16167.23s -> 16186.89s]  And maybe like a blue. I love Navy really like nautical colors. I like blue white navy
[16187.13s -> 16194.60s]  This is too dark. Excuse me

[16281.48s -> 16301.84s]  Now the question is should I just have that be blue I think so. Okay. Yeah, what's wrong with this?

[16754.09s -> 16763.06s]  I feel like I have something I have something to prove. I have this the boring
[16765.16s -> 16781.64s]  Generic to streamer maybe no. No too old ugly. No
[16783.16s -> 16784.60s]  Ugly

[16908.85s -> 16953.26s]  Goldner. All right. Now we're talking now we need I need to get a couple more lamps. I hate
[16954.14s -> 16958.53s]  Ceiling fans, you know, I hate ceiling fans because most people that have a ceiling fan
[16958.53s -> 16961.93s]  I mean a lot of people have it fine
[16962.09s -> 16968.64s]  But when a ceiling fan is not mounted completely correctly, it's not maybe screwed in all the way on one side
[16969.20s -> 16971.88s]  When they have that weird
[16972.36s -> 16974.76s]  Wobble it just induces
[16975.72s -> 16980.69s]  Anxiety in my brain. I hate it if it's not perfect
[16980.69s -> 16987.38s]  And I don't like when a ceiling fan spins a lot something about it freaks me out the fact
[16987.38s -> 16989.90s]  If especially if you have a specific ceiling fan and you like, oh, yeah
[16989.90s -> 16994.46s]  I turn the ceiling fan on and this thing is a blender sitting above us on the couch
[16994.46s -> 16995.88s]  I don't know
[16995.88s -> 17000.40s]  I just feel like dude if that thing if it falls it's we're just literally chopped up like a fucking helicopter and like GTA
[17000.68s -> 17008.44s]  Especially when they're on high. This is you look up and you just see this
[17008.92s -> 17030.80s]  Helicopter blade just spinning. I don't like it mounted on the wall like a normal person and not sharp
[17031.52s -> 17040.46s]  It's something about how fast it moves. I don't like fast things. Let me name you some things that I don't like
[17040.46s -> 17042.70s]  I don't like when a car goes fast
[17044.91s -> 17061.18s]  Speeding and shit. I really don't like it anything that goes fast like more than 70 80 miles per hour is like
[17061.76s -> 17065.10s]  No, no, no. No, I don't like when cars go fast
[17065.52s -> 17077.76s]  I don't like the things spin really fast. You laugh at car accidents in video games
[17077.76s -> 17091.48s]  It's geared of ovens cars and fans. I don't like I don't like snakes
[17091.48s -> 17095.78s]  I love snake theoretically on paper as an animal
[17095.80s -> 17099.49s]  But I don't like how fast they are if they want to just be like
[17100.51s -> 17104.10s]  They can just go. It's I don't know what they couldn't move too fast
[17105.40s -> 17113.70s]  Spiders that can like sprint. I just don't like when things move fast. Yeah balloons
[17113.90s -> 17120.44s]  They fill up boom real fast air shoots out bomb like bomb explodes. I don't like it. I hate it
[17120.48s -> 17151.19s]  Okay, what was I doing? Yeah, I need the want the recessed lights anything with a lot of tension or that moves really fast
[17151.19s -> 17156.64s]  I do not like how's this one?
[17156.64s -> 17163.33s]  It's all right. I got a I'm gonna move these because I want to know what I'm gonna make sure I know where the couch is
[17163.39s -> 17183.94s]  You know what I'm saying suck. I'm just like poked a hole in my ceiling. You are a prey animal
[17192.10s -> 17198.57s]  So funny

[17254.22s -> 17284.60s]  You're a bunny. Yeah bunnies. This stream is all over the place. Should we tell them bear? Nope, actually, you know what?
[17284.64s -> 17288.34s]  I actually feel like a lot of you probably could be a bear like a grizzly bear
[17288.34s -> 17298.33s]  No, you don't want none of you lions lions the guy with the fucking ear pods on just blasting music in the gym
[17298.49s -> 17320.98s]  Like, you know, we're not we're not lions here. They look lizards. Yep. Oh, yeah

[17389.10s -> 17400.03s]  I actually think they're probably more there are probably more anteaters here than sheeps really believe I think so
[17400.03s -> 17416.34s]  Let's get some furniture. No brick. I just think of bread
[17416.34s -> 17429.66s]  This looks like it hurts to sit on so it's like a coffin. This is a coffin. No, no
[17429.66s -> 17440.78s]  I like this one because it's like I don't know the couch is there another now

[17460.75s -> 17473.37s]  This is okay, too. I actually kind of like this even though it's kind of weird. Oh, this one looks like a musical instrument
[17476.46s -> 17495.92s]  Too elaborate too many holes big too fancy weird a bed. Eh, uh
[17498.59s -> 17505.26s]  What was that on and I liked it? I like this one. It's kind of I like it
[17505.26s -> 17514.42s]  It's kind of weird a big corner. All right, what color do I want? It's comfy

[17581.73s -> 17587.60s]  I like a TV out on the wall the couch kind of needs to be here though
[17587.60s -> 17607.39s]  I don't I'm what I don't like the setup and then I'm stealing this and putting the TV here and you can't fucking stop me

[19931.35s -> 19937.27s]  I'm gonna give shit about anything else. It's all about detail work. Nothing else matters only detail work

[19988.18s -> 19992.54s]  Rome wasn't built in the day. It took them the whole of it long. The Bible took the right
[19992.70s -> 20024.22s]  All right. What am I getting right? Okay any table Rome wasn't written in the Bible
[20024.22s -> 20030.21s]  But what okay Rome wasn't built in the day

[20133.51s -> 20136.73s]  Think about the detail work look at Mount Fiji, okay
