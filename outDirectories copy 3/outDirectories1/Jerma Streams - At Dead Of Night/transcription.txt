[3.58s -> 16.60s]  Hello, hello. Oh shit, Vinny raided. Hello, uh, Vinesauce viewers. Just got back. How you doing?
[16.60s -> 24.84s]  We are moving on. It's always fun to play with Vinny. Good to see Vinny again. We are going to play
[24.84s -> 34.07s]  a couple more horror games, and this one is apparently a doozy, from what I've been told.
[34.07s -> 44.94s]  This is At Dead of Night. This apparently has really, really bad scares, and I'm... you know me.
[44.94s -> 56.54s]  There's no settings in this game, so I imagine just an FMV. We'll find out right now, won't we?
[56.54s -> 74.06s]  I need to change the game because the title can be the same. At Dead of Night. All right, coming back.
[74.06s -> 91.69s]  Let's see if you can see me, which I think you should be able to. Oh, not quite. There we are.
[91.69s -> 103.75s]  There's that, and then here am I. Okay, I can't really turn the lights off because it's still day here.
[103.75s -> 109.72s]  It doesn't work. Turn this on. I don't know how loud this game is, but it's apparently,
[109.72s -> 116.73s]  I would imagine it's probably very loud. Let's find out. Okay, Q&W is audio loudness.
[121.88s -> 132.46s]  I should probably watch the to- okay, I'm gonna watch- let's watch the intro. Is that too loud?
[132.46s -> 141.18s]  Watch full tutorial. Watch the- what should I do? Do it louder? This is loud, man. Just I'm making
[141.18s -> 157.51s]  sure you understand that. Should I just watch the tutorial? Way too loud. I- what the- it's at zero!
[157.59s -> 196.52s]  Hold on. Okay, you have to stop her. The chase. He hides whenever he can. Oh my god, this is gonna
[196.52s -> 205.14s]  suck. I'm not looking forward to this. He can't hide on the stairs, or on the ground floor,
[206.68s -> 220.84s]  or in the basement. So, okay. What's my strategy? Move out of line of sight if he sees you.
[221.40s -> 240.63s]  Got any unlocked room you can hide? If he comes in, just- okay, so hide in the bathroom?
[240.63s -> 267.40s]  Hide, okay. Use the spy glass? You can call out. Of course, the game where the monster or the bad
[267.40s -> 290.14s]  person is chasing you, lock him in. All right, I forgot everything. Is this spoilers? Spoilers,
[290.14s -> 299.45s]  idiot? It's the tutorial of the game! It's the game's tutorial! Hey, what do you mean,
[299.45s -> 339.99s]  spoilers? Okay, all right. So, let's watch the prologue. Two FPS Andy?
[346.30s -> 347.50s]  Why am I at two FPS Andy?
[365.03s -> 378.74s]  Why are all FMV games British? Are they?
[389.45s -> 392.89s]  Yeah, how come the FPS are bad? There's no video settings I could do.
[393.69s -> 396.02s]  I'm not dropping frames. I don't know.
[411.35s -> 421.35s]  Very nice friends. Very nice. And there's quite a few of you I see as well. Nice to see so many
[422.07s -> 430.63s]  fresh young faces for a change. You're here for the music festival in town, I presume?
[431.27s -> 435.19s]  Yeah, we were supposed to be camping that night. Somebody said, why is she not talking?
[437.59s -> 441.75s]  She is now. Will you be staying for breakfast?
[441.75s -> 447.35s]  I don't think so. We'll probably just get going. That's fine. And if you don't mind me asking,
[447.35s -> 453.99s]  Maya, would you be interested in the entertainment tonight? Tonight? Starts around
[453.99s -> 461.75s]  midnight, usually. It's me doing it. Actually, comedy. Ooh, okay. I do this comedy character
[461.75s -> 470.55s]  called Hugo Punch. He's sort of this comedic sociopath, says things that you're not supposed
[470.55s -> 477.45s]  to say and that sort of thing. It's quite popular with students. I don't think so.
[477.45s -> 479.45s]  That's not me. You're all just going to bed, I think.
[479.45s -> 483.42s]  This is really familiar. Oh, stop it. Twist your arm on this.
[483.42s -> 489.53s]  It's okay. I'd rather just go to bed. Sorry. Fine, fine, fine.
[489.53s -> 493.77s]  Which way are the rooms? Just take the lift. You're on the first
[493.77s -> 497.53s]  floor. Okay, thanks. Oh shit, wait a minute. It is midnight in England right now.
[497.69s -> 501.77s]  Drop your key off in the box, if you will, Maya, please, tomorrow.
[502.41s -> 510.55s]  It's midnight in England right now. Best show in town and no takers.
[514.18s -> 522.66s]  Who needs proper entertainment when you've got YouTube and my face or whatever? Stupid, uncultured.
[526.38s -> 530.60s]  Why is it running like this? Don't start this again.
[531.48s -> 534.87s]  I feel like the menu is doing this, but when I, I don't know.
[534.87s -> 541.13s]  I don't want to hear it, okay? Not tonight. Go to the settings. There aren't any settings.
[541.13s -> 555.90s]  No to children of bad eggs. They need to be taught a lesson.
[555.90s -> 559.98s]  Uh-oh. Shut up. Just shut up.
[561.14s -> 566.26s]  You always do this. They're paying customers. Wait, they haven't done anything to you.
[566.26s -> 568.66s]  I don't think so. Just leave them alone.
[570.22s -> 575.50s]  Bad eggs need cracking. Whack them hard and crack the shell. Kick them down the stairs to hell.
[576.70s -> 584.28s]  You know what you need to do, Jimmy. Show them who's boss. That's the way to do it.
[586.84s -> 608.86s]  Okay. I want to fix this. What the fuck is going on?
[609.86s -> 613.62s]  Disable G-Sync. I don't think I've ever turned.
[620.81s -> 643.26s]  Press alt to enter. It'll toggle full screen. I think it is in full screen.
[644.06s -> 646.68s]  We'll see. If I actually start playing, see what happens.
[657.30s -> 664.34s]  Breaking bad intro. It actually is. I think it's the same sound. It's the same drum beat.
[674.78s -> 680.66s]  All right. If I hit escape, is again, can I maybe?
[681.46s -> 695.30s]  Sea View Hotel has a dark past. Its ghosts have a story to tell.
[695.94s -> 703.10s]  Find them. Use the ghost and spirit receiver to talk to them.
[703.10s -> 709.24s]  They'll tell you Jimmy's secrets.
[709.24s -> 725.46s]  Jimmy! Jimmy! Okay. Let me see if the FPS is still bad.
[728.74s -> 737.96s]  It's back to normal now. Okay. So, all right. Start new game. The story of Jimmy Hall.
[737.96s -> 742.33s]  Okay. Choose standard game or extreme game. When playing the extreme game,
[742.33s -> 745.67s]  if Jimmy attacks you, he will take almost everything every time.
[745.67s -> 748.63s]  Your current game will be lost when you begin a new one and your achievements will be...
[748.63s -> 750.47s]  Oh, we're just doing standard. We're not doing extreme.
[751.03s -> 759.03s]  Oh, we're going. We're going. This is the device you found. Select this to switch it on.
[762.34s -> 765.30s]  It can detect spirits voices if you're near enough to them.
[765.30s -> 770.74s]  They're going to turn it up a little. Okay. If you haven't seen it,
[770.74s -> 772.90s]  go to the main menu and watch the tutorial. Okay.
[775.13s -> 785.46s]  Oh, yeah. This game hates my computer. What should I do?
[785.46s -> 795.19s]  Is it weird? Yeah. GPU settings enable or disable G-Sync.
[795.19s -> 802.95s]  Restart it. It looks fine. It looks fine in the menu here.
[802.95s -> 809.67s]  Yeah. It's when I'm in the actual game. It's in the Nvidia Control Panel.
[809.67s -> 817.03s]  Okay. Nvidia Control Panel. Opening that now. All right.
[818.62s -> 826.55s]  So now manage 3D settings. Monitor technology G-Sync, right?
[826.55s -> 834.65s]  It's under display. Monitor just G-Sync. G-Sync can call. All right.
[834.65s -> 842.82s]  So I'm going to turn... I'm turning off G-Sync. Windows G is enable.
[842.82s -> 849.14s]  I don't think I have that set up. Windows G enable. Windows G? Is this real?
[849.14s -> 854.68s]  Don't fuck with me. Is this real? Is it going to crash my computer?
[854.68s -> 857.08s]  That's a meme. God damn it. All right. I'm in...
[857.88s -> 865.05s]  I'm in the Nvidia Control Panel. So go to monitor... I'm at manage 3D settings.
[865.05s -> 868.49s]  I can't turn G-Sync off. I can only make it something else.
[868.49s -> 873.96s]  What the fuck did I just do? It's in Windows settings.
[873.96s -> 882.87s]  What do I need to... Okay. I can do fixed refresh under monitor technology.
[882.87s -> 891.51s]  Should I do fixed refresh or ULMB? Fixed refresh. Is this going to help?
[891.51s -> 900.47s]  Okay. I just did fixed refresh. Apply. Oh fuck. What happened?
[900.47s -> 906.25s]  Oh my God. What just happened? Are we okay? Did that fix it?
[906.25s -> 917.91s]  I think we're good. I think that fixed it. Is my cam fine?
[917.91s -> 921.43s]  Oh my God. You guys are absolute heroes. Yeah. You fixed it. We're good.
[921.43s -> 927.00s]  We're good. Looks perfect. I thought you guys were making that whole thing up.
[927.00s -> 931.05s]  Like, oh dude, turn off G-Sync. It's like, huh?
[931.05s -> 935.66s]  All right. So I can turn it on. If you haven't seen it. Yeah. Yeah. We did.
[935.66s -> 945.51s]  So turn the device on. I can talk. Try to make contact with a spirit.
[945.51s -> 951.24s]  There's no reply. There are no spirits around. A loud noise means there's a
[951.24s -> 955.50s]  spirit in a high energy state near. All right. When you meet spirits, you can
[955.50s -> 960.31s]  ask them questions. Pair their replies to make connections. When you're alone,
[960.31s -> 968.70s]  you can review spirits' replies here. Okay. Is anyone there? Is anyone there?
[968.70s -> 984.12s]  Okay. All right. All right. Let's get out of here. Where should I go?
[984.12s -> 997.22s]  You need a compass and a scrying mirror. Okay. I'm going up.
[1020.73s -> 1037.70s]  Is someone there? I fucking hate this already.
[1037.70s -> 1061.08s]  Okay. Room 301. Anybody in here? Is someone there?
[1061.08s -> 1110.15s]  There's nothing in here. Okay. Oh, it's loud.
[1110.15s -> 1129.35s]  302. This is fucking dark in here. How do I turn the light on?
[1129.35s -> 1138.78s]  How do I turn the light on in this room? It's too dark. How do I turn the light on?
[1138.78s -> 1179.42s]  Is someone there? Who's there? What room? Is this 301?
[1181.14s -> 1190.26s]  Hey, hey, hey. Hey. No. Hello. Hello.
[1191.91s -> 1212.58s]  The wind got higher. Okay. I don't think there's anything here.
[1212.58s -> 1234.98s]  Blocked. Room 9. Anybody in here? I need to find a compass.
[1234.98s -> 1241.19s]  I think I have to go back downstairs. Is someone there?
[1241.19s -> 1257.58s]  Haunted Google Maps. Oh, you found a handwritten note which reads goodbye.
[1257.58s -> 1263.72s]  I'm sorry for everything. What does that mean? What does that do?
[1263.72s -> 1276.60s]  Okay. I've got a note. Is someone there? Is anyone there?
[1277.40s -> 1295.72s]  I'm going to go right across. Wait. I can open the other. Wait.
[1295.72s -> 1308.65s]  You can open both drawers. That is just one. You found dead lock key to room 309.
[1308.65s -> 1315.99s]  Doors can be locked or unlocked. Oh, I can. So I can hide in here?
[1315.99s -> 1325.16s]  Okay. So I can hide in here now and lock the door. Okay. Good to know.
[1325.16s -> 1361.11s]  I'm going right across. Okay. What's in here? Another. Okay. Another key to bolt the door.
[1361.11s -> 1371.06s]  Copper wire. What's that do? Copper wire. All right. Anybody in here?
[1371.06s -> 1377.67s]  Is anyone there? It's been 15 minutes.
[1377.67s -> 1396.68s]  You haven't even done the first objective. Yeah. So what? To find a where would a compass be?
[1396.68s -> 1414.79s]  Okay. I'm going to go down. Okay. I'm going down.
[1419.24s -> 1427.35s]  Where should I go? Second floor or first floor? I'm going to go second floor.
[1466.25s -> 1485.62s]  Dark. What's in here? Really? This got to be like a compass in here, right?
[1485.62s -> 1491.82s]  Is anyone there? Remove the motion blur.
[1491.82s -> 1499.67s]  There are guys. There are no video settings in this game. I think it's supposed to hide.
[1499.67s -> 1528.76s]  Let me try that way. No, it's locked. Why is this locked too? First floor?
[1537.83s -> 1547.00s]  I'm going around. You have G motion blur on.
[1565.37s -> 1574.62s]  Is someone here? What's that fucking noise? Get it. Hide, hide, hide, hide in the locker.
[1574.62s -> 1582.70s]  Hide in the hide somewhere. Can I hide in this locker? What the fuck is that?
[1582.70s -> 1585.34s]  Spirit. I'm here. Stupid. Idiot.
[1586.94s -> 1593.02s]  Is someone there? Is someone there? Where are you?
[1593.50s -> 1655.30s]  Is someone there? He's there. What? Really? Where'd you go?
[1659.88s -> 1677.59s]  Locked. Oh, I can. It's the most loud here. Look at how loud this is.
[1677.67s -> 1684.22s]  What should I do about this? Is someone there?
[1684.22s -> 1691.50s]  Near the lockers? No, it's off there. Is someone there?
[1691.50s -> 1703.16s]  I don't think I can do anything here. You need to get the compass in the mirror.
[1705.64s -> 1709.48s]  Yeah, I don't. The game, the game did not say, hey, you need to get the compass in the mirror.
[1709.48s -> 1723.54s]  By the way, they're in 104 and in the garage. It did. Yes, it did. What are you talking about?
[1726.92s -> 1730.76s]  It's, it did. The game said to get them. It didn't say where they were.
[1731.32s -> 1754.23s]  Huh? You need to find a compass in scrying mirror. It doesn't say where it is.
[1754.23s -> 1788.62s]  I'm going to go to my room. My room is 101. I'm going to 101. Don't go that fucking far.
[1788.62s -> 1804.78s]  106. Let's just go in here. See?
[1809.08s -> 1839.02s]  Found some childish, violent drawings. OK. Is anyone there?
[1839.02s -> 1856.74s]  Nothing in here. Why is the music getting louder? I know, but I don't know where it is.
[1856.82s -> 1869.94s]  Got to go to 101. I'm so concerned. He's going to be here. It's so quiet.
[1869.94s -> 1885.00s]  Where's 101? 107. I'm in the wrong fucking way.
[1887.10s -> 1894.41s]  101. 108. Fuck. All right. I'm just going in here.
[1907.06s -> 1918.14s]  Oh, hurry up. He's looking for me right now.
[1918.14s -> 2001.29s]  Where is he? OK. Check these. Does this one even work?
[2002.25s -> 2022.84s]  Oh my fucking God. Oh, that's very bad. Dude, I got a sword.
[2022.84s -> 2024.52s]  All right. Can I hit him with the sword?
[2033.93s -> 2036.38s]  Is anyone there? I have all this shit.
[2036.38s -> 2045.54s]  I can't talk to anybody. It's down the hall somewhere.
[2045.54s -> 2080.68s]  You found everything but the compass. Oh, I don't know where it is.
[2080.68s -> 2091.98s]  I have to get to 101. Oh, fuck. I went the wrong way.
[2104.14s -> 2123.69s]  107. All right. 106. Dude, where the fuck is 101?
[2124.25s -> 2138.98s]  101. Let's go. Let's go. All right. I'm in. Lock the door.
[2138.98s -> 2149.82s]  All right. What's in here? This is my stuff. All right. Key.
[2149.82s -> 2163.74s]  Bottle of turpentine and a lighter. You found a chef's hat.
[2163.74s -> 2169.43s]  Is someone there? I found every single item in the game.
[2169.43s -> 2199.53s]  Besides the one I need. That sounds far away.
[2199.53s -> 2201.59s]  I'm going to try to get to the elevator.
[2201.59s -> 2208.86s]  I got really high. I got really high and went to sleep last night.
[2208.86s -> 2212.92s]  I had a dream. All right. Hold on.
[2212.92s -> 2218.44s]  At one point, Jerma was stealing a spaceship.
[2218.44s -> 2220.92s]  As he flies around, he just makes some insane incoherent noises.
[2222.50s -> 2227.29s]  I was speaking of being high. So Holly and I were high the other night.
[2227.29s -> 2230.70s]  And you're going to laugh. So Holly and I are high.
[2230.70s -> 2234.22s]  We're, you know, whatever. We're just doing a little bit of recreational marijuana.
[2234.30s -> 2241.02s]  Whatever. And we started, it started, we started getting really, really high.
[2241.02s -> 2245.30s]  So it's like, all right, fuck, man, we need a palate cleanser.
[2245.30s -> 2248.58s]  Because like we were on YouTube and it was like we were watching videos and shit.
[2248.58s -> 2251.40s]  And it was like, okay, we need some kind of palate cleanser.
[2251.40s -> 2254.50s]  So we went to this video specifically titled.
[2254.50s -> 2259.13s]  It was called cute animals from when you, for when you are stressed.
[2259.69s -> 2264.14s]  Cute animals for when you are stressed. It's like, okay, let's put that on.
[2264.14s -> 2270.54s]  There was a pre-roll ad on this video and it went exactly like this.
[2270.54s -> 2276.28s]  Crime is skyrocketing. Your, your life could potentially be
[2276.28s -> 2279.64s]  changed dramatically in the future. That's why you need to vote.
[2279.64s -> 2283.50s]  It was a political ad talking about how crime was skyrocketing.
[2283.50s -> 2285.18s]  We're going to go to like a dystopian future.
[2285.18s -> 2289.56s]  And we were just sitting there like, what are the cute animals? What's happening?
[2289.56s -> 2291.80s]  Crime is skyrocketing, honey. Did you know that?
[2293.29s -> 2303.11s]  It was fucked. It caused way more stress.
[2303.11s -> 2323.72s]  Anyways, let's keep going. Okay.
[2323.72s -> 2328.41s]  I need to get back to the elevator and go to the basement again.
[2328.41s -> 2343.37s]  I can't open that. Go back.
[2343.37s -> 2346.78s]  Check every single room. Did we go in 107?
[2346.78s -> 2362.15s]  Uh-oh. I've given up trying to help.
[2365.77s -> 2369.85s]  I'm sorry. If I look over here and this 10,000 messages a second.
[2370.97s -> 2372.81s]  I'm sorry. I can't read what you said.
[2372.81s -> 2393.42s]  Okay. I didn't look in here yet.
[2393.42s -> 2418.34s]  There's nothing in here. Did I go in 109?
[2418.34s -> 2420.58s]  I did. No, I've been in here. I've been, I've been in pretty much.
[2420.58s -> 2421.62s]  I got to go to the other side.
[2421.62s -> 2425.08s]  Yeah. This is where the, this is where the, the sword was.
[2425.08s -> 2429.85s]  I have to go to like one, like 12 to like 115 or something, right?
[2429.85s -> 2439.72s]  Because I can't open these with this key.
[2439.72s -> 2444.46s]  So I have to go to the other side. What was that?
[2444.46s -> 2449.53s]  Okay. That's me running. I did 107.
[2456.02s -> 2459.46s]  Did I go over here? It's okay. 112.
[2460.02s -> 2466.44s]  There's nothing in here.
[2466.44s -> 2470.14s]  You don't have a storage unit or something here?
[2470.14s -> 2475.26s]  There you go. Okay.
[2475.26s -> 2476.78s]  I found the compass. Finally.
[2482.20s -> 2487.82s]  You told me to go to the basement. Yeah. Okay.
[2487.82s -> 2498.12s]  Okay. I'm making progress.
[2498.12s -> 2502.04s]  You need to find a scrying mirror. I bet it's down here.
[2510.07s -> 2519.16s]  Where's this compass? How do I, can I pick up the compass?
[2519.16s -> 2521.00s]  All right. I'm going to keep going down this way because this other,
[2521.00s -> 2522.92s]  I'm going to go right across, open up that one.
[2522.92s -> 2531.13s]  To point towards spirits.
[2531.13s -> 2539.40s]  It's too dark. I get a flashlight, I guess, eventually probably, right?
[2539.40s -> 2563.82s]  114. Too dark. Scrying mirror.
[2564.46s -> 2568.78s]  Come on. Trophies and awards.
[2569.82s -> 2571.50s]  That's not a scrying mirror.
[2571.50s -> 2582.63s]  Turn the lights off, dude. This isn't even scary.
[2582.63s -> 2601.56s]  It's, it's the middle of the day.
[2601.56s -> 2627.48s]  Uh-oh. This is open. Jesus.
[2627.48s -> 2631.67s]  Okay. I don't think there's anything I can do here.
[2650.52s -> 2655.82s]  Oh, wooden paddle and another key.
[2655.82s -> 2661.56s]  Where is this mirror? Wait, can I look in there?
[2661.56s -> 2703.61s]  It's too dark. Too dark.
[2703.61s -> 2705.13s]  It's pointing this way.
[2705.13s -> 2718.78s]  Why is it, what's going on? Why is it, why is, why is, what's behind me?
[2718.78s -> 2723.58s]  He's literally behind me right now.
[2723.58s -> 2725.26s]  Oh, fuck. Get in here.
[2725.26s -> 2750.66s]  He doesn't actually come in here, right? I just scratched my nose.
[2750.66s -> 2773.62s]  Wait, lock the old suitcases.
[2774.34s -> 2786.78s]  Okay. I'm going to go down.
[2786.78s -> 2811.26s]  I feel like he's right here.
[2811.26s -> 2812.22s]  Where are you?
[2812.22s -> 2813.27s]  Oh my God.
[2813.27s -> 2818.20s]  All right. How do I get the fuck out of here?
[2818.20s -> 2822.04s]  Elevator, elevator, elevator. Right here.
[2822.04s -> 2824.79s]  Go. Quickly, please. Okay.
[2824.79s -> 2825.75s]  Go on. Hurry, please.
[2828.98s -> 2832.41s]  Garage.
[2834.38s -> 2835.02s]  All right. I'm good.
[2838.42s -> 2839.86s]  I haven't looked down here.
[2839.86s -> 2862.09s]  They're going like the back office.
[2863.27s -> 2863.99s]  He's not here.
[2863.99s -> 2874.39s]  No, I can't do anything in here.
[2874.39s -> 2875.19s]  Is someone there?
[2878.31s -> 2890.07s]  Where the fuck I'm going, but I'm going.
[2891.19s -> 2905.11s]  Can I not interact with anything in here?
[2913.08s -> 2923.61s]  Jesus.
[2924.23s -> 2936.58s]  Okay. I guess I'm going to go down again.
[2936.58s -> 2937.54s]  Ghostless run.
[2942.25s -> 2947.53s]  Lower ground.
[2947.53s -> 2949.69s]  I'm going to complete the game without seeing him once.
[2949.69s -> 2960.81s]  I was already down here.
[2960.81s -> 2965.32s]  Remember? I already did this.
[2966.84s -> 2969.69s]  There was that little girl down here.
[2974.31s -> 2985.13s]  I can talk to the spirit now.
[2985.13s -> 2990.17s]  I don't think so.
[2991.16s -> 2991.96s]  Is someone there?
[2999.78s -> 3000.26s]  Hello.
[3000.26s -> 3001.22s]  What's your name?
[3001.22s -> 3006.01s]  Who are you?
[3006.01s -> 3007.21s]  Amy Bell.
[3007.21s -> 3008.72s]  I'm 10.
[3011.83s -> 3012.33s]  Okay.
[3016.38s -> 3022.02s]  I saw a girl in the basement crying.
[3022.02s -> 3022.50s]  Is that you?
[3022.50s -> 3023.06s]  Who was she?
[3034.92s -> 3035.64s]  Hey.
[3036.66s -> 3038.26s]  Who drew those violent pictures?
[3046.34s -> 3046.84s]  Okay.
[3047.70s -> 3049.14s]  Who wrote the note that says goodbye?
[3049.70s -> 3054.09s]  Okay.
[3054.47s -> 3056.42s]  What do you know about the sword?
[3056.42s -> 3057.78s]  Who does the sword belong to?
[3061.85s -> 3062.35s]  Okay.
[3062.97s -> 3070.82s]  What was the coil of wire used for?
[3076.18s -> 3076.68s]  Okay.
[3077.30s -> 3080.07s]  What is turpentine?
[3080.07s -> 3082.47s]  I found a bottle of turpentine in a lighter.
[3083.19s -> 3083.99s]  What were they for?
[3083.99s -> 3085.43s]  I don't know what that is.
[3085.43s -> 3086.07s]  I'm 10.
[3087.11s -> 3095.34s]  Who did the chef's hat belong to?
[3100.62s -> 3101.42s]  Who are the whiskey bottles?
[3101.42s -> 3103.74s]  Is there a collection of whiskey bottles in one of the rooms?
[3110.94s -> 3111.34s]  Okay.
[3111.34s -> 3111.84s]  Yep.
[3112.60s -> 3113.10s]  Okay.
[3113.64s -> 3114.76s]  I found some trophies.
[3115.32s -> 3115.96s]  Who won them?
[3119.80s -> 3120.92s]  I don't know.
[3120.92s -> 3130.49s]  Where did the wooden paddle come from?
[3130.49s -> 3132.65s]  I saw some suitcases in a chest.
[3133.21s -> 3134.41s]  Who did they belong to?
[3138.82s -> 3139.62s]  I don't know.
[3140.50s -> 3141.00s]  Okay.
[3142.01s -> 3145.94s]  So we've learned absolutely nothing.
[3153.11s -> 3153.83s]  All we learned...
[3156.06s -> 3156.62s]  What?
[3156.62s -> 3170.66s]  All right.
[3170.66s -> 3171.94s]  Where is this mirror?
[3176.63s -> 3177.59s]  I need the mirror.
[3179.53s -> 3180.73s]  I don't know where the fuck it is.
[3182.09s -> 3182.89s]  It's not down here.
[3183.61s -> 3189.26s]  I missed a few rooms.
[3191.94s -> 3192.66s]  Third floor.
[3193.86s -> 3194.58s]  Ground floor.
[3194.58s -> 3196.34s]  I feel like I didn't explore everything.
[3199.11s -> 3202.39s]  We learned that Jimmy was a fucked up boy who had a sword in turpentine.
[3202.95s -> 3203.45s]  Yeah.
[3205.69s -> 3208.58s]  See, I've seen a lot of G's.
[3209.46s -> 3210.18s]  You can backseat.
[3210.18s -> 3210.68s]  This game's...
[3211.70s -> 3214.38s]  It's one of those games where you need to...
[3215.26s -> 3216.30s]  I don't know what you're doing.
[3216.30s -> 3216.94s]  I don't mind it.
[3217.50s -> 3226.46s]  Ground floor.
[3227.02s -> 3242.52s]  I already went down here.
[3243.00s -> 3244.50s]  All right.
[3244.50s -> 3245.86s]  Where are the rooms on the ground floor?
[3253.26s -> 3253.90s]  No help.
[3253.90s -> 3254.78s]  No help.
[3254.78s -> 3258.63s]  The compass will bring you to the mirror.
[3259.19s -> 3262.42s]  You have a key for floor one stairs.
[3264.02s -> 3264.52s]  I do?
[3268.39s -> 3270.42s]  All right.
[3270.42s -> 3271.06s]  Let's go to one.
[3272.50s -> 3274.02s]  Where did I not go in one though?
[3274.02s -> 3274.98s]  I feel like I opened everything.
[3275.86s -> 3282.22s]  I feel like I went in 107.
[3298.12s -> 3298.76s]  You did.
[3298.76s -> 3315.75s]  This one here?
[3316.47s -> 3319.43s]  Where is it pointing?
[3319.43s -> 3320.95s]  Where is this compass pointing?
[3320.95s -> 3324.94s]  Dude, this compass is pointing in such...
[3324.94s -> 3325.42s]  What is this?
[3325.42s -> 3326.14s]  Where's it pointing?
[3326.70s -> 3336.84s]  This compass is just going in a circle.
[3336.84s -> 3346.14s]  What's this?
[3347.18s -> 3348.23s]  This door room.
[3348.23s -> 3352.49s]  It's pointing nowhere because it's in another floor.
[3352.49s -> 3396.79s]  Oh.
[3396.79s -> 3398.55s]  102 to 105.
[3398.55s -> 3406.78s]  121.
[3408.14s -> 3408.94s]  Uh-oh.
[3408.94s -> 3414.07s]  122.
[3414.71s -> 3416.42s]  123.
[3416.42s -> 3417.62s]  None of these are probably going to work.
[3417.62s -> 3418.26s]  The next one does.
[3418.26s -> 3418.66s]  All right.
[3418.66s -> 3419.30s]  123.
[3419.94s -> 3428.54s]  Give me the mirror.
[3433.45s -> 3433.69s]  Dang.
[3433.69s -> 3434.41s]  Ah.
[3434.41s -> 3437.11s]  I thought it was a mirror.
[3437.11s -> 3445.64s]  I'm going to go straight across to 122.
[3445.64s -> 3467.22s]  What?
[3467.22s -> 3468.18s]  Wait, I have a...
[3468.18s -> 3469.70s]  There's more than one compass?
[3469.70s -> 3473.37s]  You've done a syringe?
[3474.17s -> 3477.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[3477.18s -> 3477.50s]  Okay.
[3477.50s -> 3477.98s]  All right.
[3478.46s -> 3479.42s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[3479.42s -> 3480.06s]  Hide, hide, hide, hide.
[3480.06s -> 3480.46s]  I've never seen it.
[3480.46s -> 3481.74s]  I don't even know what the guy does.
[3481.74s -> 3484.41s]  I don't even know what he does.
[3484.41s -> 3496.36s]  I found every other item in the whole game.
[3496.36s -> 3503.98s]  He's on the floor.
[3503.98s -> 3505.42s]  He's on your floor, but you're safe.
[3505.42s -> 3510.84s]  All right.
[3510.84s -> 3511.24s]  What am I...
[3511.24s -> 3515.58s]  No.
[3515.58s -> 3528.95s]  I have to go to 102 to 105.
[3528.95s -> 3530.23s]  I don't even know how to get there from here.
[3531.03s -> 3532.47s]  I think I'm just going to go for it, right?
[3571.32s -> 3572.12s]  Holy shit.
[3572.12s -> 3572.60s]  No way.
[3573.83s -> 3574.07s]  What?
[3580.30s -> 3581.02s]  Get...
[3581.02s -> 3581.82s]  Get out of here.
[3581.82s -> 3582.86s]  Why could he not see me?
[3583.82s -> 3606.28s]  Did he leave the room?
[3606.28s -> 3606.92s]  Holy God.
[3606.92s -> 3607.88s]  This guy sucks.
[3607.88s -> 3640.66s]  This guy sucks.
[3640.66s -> 3642.10s]  He heard me say that.
[3642.10s -> 3646.90s]  He heard me say that.
[3646.90s -> 3647.86s]  Jesus.
[3647.86s -> 3649.27s]  What did that say?
[3649.27s -> 3651.83s]  What happened?
[3651.83s -> 3654.30s]  Look, my whole body hurts.
[3655.18s -> 3656.58s]  I heard the door close,
[3656.58s -> 3658.26s]  but that was not the front door closing.
[3658.26s -> 3663.11s]  That was the bathroom door closing.
[3663.11s -> 3665.05s]  My shoulder hurts.
[3665.05s -> 3666.33s]  Oh, my God.
[3668.28s -> 3668.60s]  I just...
[3668.60s -> 3669.24s]  There was no...
[3670.42s -> 3672.34s]  There was no road in my brain
[3672.34s -> 3675.56s]  that led to that guy was still in the room.
[3675.56s -> 3676.92s]  He takes things.
[3676.92s -> 3681.53s]  Oh, he took my radio.
[3681.61s -> 3682.33s]  All right.
[3682.33s -> 3683.37s]  So it said, look...
[3683.37s -> 3684.33s]  There was a thing that popped up.
[3684.33s -> 3688.36s]  What did it say?
[3688.36s -> 3689.96s]  Look in the first floor near the stairs.
[3689.96s -> 3690.44s]  Okay.
[3690.44s -> 3699.86s]  Where am I?
[3699.86s -> 3700.34s]  107...
[3700.34s -> 3702.26s]  Oh, I'm in 107.
[3702.26s -> 3703.90s]  I need to get to one...
[3708.63s -> 3714.30s]  No, other way.
[3714.30s -> 3715.50s]  I need like 102.
[3716.22s -> 3718.07s]  108.
[3718.87s -> 3721.99s]  Look in the first floor store near the stairs.
[3721.99s -> 3728.78s]  I need like 102.
[3729.34s -> 3739.10s]  Is it right here?
[3739.10s -> 3744.60s]  Why is it so dark?
[3761.93s -> 3762.73s]  Where are you?
[3762.73s -> 3765.69s]  Did I get so turned around?
[3765.69s -> 3767.34s]  106.
[3767.34s -> 3778.06s]  All right.
[3778.06s -> 3778.70s]  Is it in here?
[3778.70s -> 3784.50s]  This is not it.
[3802.06s -> 3811.34s]  Oh, my God.
[3811.34s -> 3811.74s]  Okay.
[3811.74s -> 3812.30s]  Can I run?
[3812.30s -> 3813.18s]  What if I just run?
[3813.18s -> 3818.10s]  Is he doing that on purpose?
[3818.10s -> 3819.14s]  He's fucking me on purpose.
[3819.14s -> 3821.19s]  He's fucking me on purpose.
[3821.19s -> 3822.31s]  Should I talk shit?
[3822.31s -> 3825.86s]  He's fucking me on purpose.
[3825.86s -> 3826.90s]  I'm gonna scream.
[3826.90s -> 3828.65s]  I can't...
[3828.65s -> 3832.01s]  I can't lock the door.
[3832.01s -> 3845.06s]  I think I have to go this way.
[3845.06s -> 3845.30s]  All right.
[3845.30s -> 3846.78s]  I'm gonna go for it.
[3846.78s -> 3848.46s]  One, two, three.
[3848.46s -> 3857.74s]  Hey, I need...
[3857.74s -> 3868.98s]  Is he behind me?
[3881.93s -> 3882.89s]  Oh, come on.
[3882.89s -> 3883.29s]  Bathroom.
[3883.85s -> 3904.50s]  What are you doing?
[3904.50s -> 3905.62s]  He's right here.
[3905.62s -> 3913.11s]  And I'm sorry.
[3913.11s -> 3916.09s]  I have a lot of trouble with hotels.
[3916.09s -> 3918.62s]  And maybe some of you can relate to this.
[3918.62s -> 3922.81s]  It doesn't matter how many times I go to my hotel room.
[3922.81s -> 3924.17s]  When I come off the elevator,
[3924.17s -> 3927.18s]  I have no fucking idea where I'm going.
[3927.18s -> 3928.78s]  Is it left, right?
[3928.78s -> 3929.66s]  I don't...
[3929.66s -> 3929.90s]  Okay.
[3929.90s -> 3932.46s]  No, there is 102 to like 110.
[3932.46s -> 3932.70s]  Okay.
[3932.70s -> 3933.34s]  I have to go that way.
[3937.46s -> 3946.26s]  I'm not gonna be able to find my way around here.
[3946.26s -> 3947.70s]  He's right outside the door.
[3947.70s -> 3948.34s]  I can't get...
[3948.34s -> 3949.22s]  I can't leave right now.
[3949.22s -> 3959.45s]  Should I just go for it?
[3959.45s -> 3978.92s]  I'm gonna go back up to three.
[3985.29s -> 3986.01s]  Should I go to three?
[3986.57s -> 3987.45s]  I don't know.
[3987.45s -> 3988.73s]  I don't know, dude.
[3988.73s -> 3989.91s]  I'm going.
[3989.91s -> 3997.90s]  Which way is he?
[3997.90s -> 4008.63s]  106.
[4008.63s -> 4013.03s]  Dude.
[4013.03s -> 4013.75s]  My god.
[4013.75s -> 4014.87s]  Oh my god.
[4015.86s -> 4016.74s]  Oh my god.
[4018.07s -> 4019.43s]  I'd somewhere right now.
[4020.50s -> 4021.06s]  Not here.
[4021.70s -> 4022.74s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[4022.74s -> 4023.70s]  I'm fucking dead.
[4023.70s -> 4036.73s]  I just don't know even...
[4036.73s -> 4037.13s]  I...
[4037.13s -> 4038.41s]  There's no signs.
[4038.41s -> 4041.62s]  I feel like I'm walking around a casino floor.
[4041.62s -> 4043.22s]  Like I just don't even know what direction I need to go in.
[4043.22s -> 4043.94s]  There's no signs.
[4043.94s -> 4045.46s]  There's one sign in front of the elevator.
[4045.46s -> 4045.78s]  That's it.
[4045.78s -> 4065.40s]  108.
[4065.40s -> 4066.70s]  Should I go in 108?
[4066.70s -> 4073.98s]  109.
[4073.98s -> 4076.76s]  I went in here, I think.
[4076.76s -> 4077.72s]  But he's coming.
[4077.72s -> 4081.75s]  This is where the sword is.
[4081.75s -> 4082.79s]  Okay, dude.
[4082.79s -> 4093.43s]  Dude, I can't think of a worse thing that I could be doing
[4093.43s -> 4095.43s]  than try to find your way around a hotel room.
[4095.43s -> 4096.46s]  If I go hotel...
[4097.58s -> 4099.83s]  You got three floors of this shit?
[4099.83s -> 4108.87s]  Every hallway is the same hallway in my brain.
[4108.87s -> 4110.09s]  It just is.
[4110.09s -> 4117.61s]  I can't open these.
[4117.61s -> 4124.49s]  I'm gonna try to go up to three.
[4124.49s -> 4129.67s]  And where is the storeroom that's apparently near the elevator?
[4129.67s -> 4135.06s]  All this shit looks the same!
[4135.06s -> 4135.56s]  All right.
[4137.74s -> 4140.95s]  What are you doing?
[4140.95s -> 4151.21s]  I just went down the same fucking hallway.
[4151.21s -> 4154.31s]  It's literally concrete all over again.
[4154.31s -> 4158.89s]  I'm better off just using the sword and swinging at the guy.
[4158.89s -> 4159.69s]  Seriously.
[4159.69s -> 4167.14s]  You've been in the same three halls over and over again.
[4167.14s -> 4168.28s]  Dude, I can't...
[4168.92s -> 4171.16s]  I can't navigate this in real life, let alone in a video game,
[4171.16s -> 4173.00s]  where somebody's chasing me with a baseball bat.
[4173.00s -> 4180.47s]  Go down the stairs.
[4180.47s -> 4182.31s]  The stairs were locked last time.
[4182.31s -> 4198.07s]  Like, where...
[4198.07s -> 4198.63s]  I gotta...
[4198.63s -> 4200.63s]  I keep, like, going in a circle.
[4200.63s -> 4203.64s]  This is one...
[4203.64s -> 4204.12s]  All right.
[4204.12s -> 4205.48s]  Where the fuck am I going?
[4205.48s -> 4209.19s]  This is one...
[4209.19s -> 4210.55s]  I haven't gone on 114.
[4210.55s -> 4211.85s]  It's fucking dark.
[4211.85s -> 4214.10s]  Never mind.
[4214.10s -> 4215.46s]  Ask for directions.
[4215.46s -> 4217.46s]  Dude, I...
[4218.26s -> 4218.90s]  I'm being honest.
[4218.90s -> 4221.53s]  I have no idea where the fuck I'm supposed to go.
[4221.53s -> 4222.81s]  Every single room is the same room.
[4222.81s -> 4224.17s]  Every hallway is the same hallway.
[4224.17s -> 4235.86s]  Is this it right here?
[4235.86s -> 4238.78s]  It's the storeroom, right?
[4238.78s -> 4254.81s]  It's not in this one.
[4254.81s -> 4255.69s]  19...
[4255.77s -> 4259.69s]  Fuck is he?
[4263.11s -> 4264.31s]  I don't know which way to go.
[4264.31s -> 4266.65s]  118...
[4266.65s -> 4267.37s]  I just have to go in a room.
[4267.37s -> 4268.41s]  I have to go in something.
[4268.41s -> 4270.65s]  Whatever.
[4270.65s -> 4271.05s]  Go...
[4271.05s -> 4271.93s]  Run to the exit sign.
[4291.40s -> 4291.96s]  Jesus.
[4291.96s -> 4292.68s]  Get out of here.
[4293.24s -> 4304.78s]  I'm going not...
[4304.78s -> 4305.66s]  I'm not going anywhere.
[4305.66s -> 4307.58s]  He's probably just sitting here.
[4307.58s -> 4331.32s]  Like, last time.
[4331.32s -> 4333.00s]  See, this shit happens.
[4333.00s -> 4335.56s]  And then I come out here and my brain has reset.
[4335.56s -> 4338.36s]  It's like, oh, this is just another nondescript hotel hallway again.
[4338.36s -> 4348.22s]  But here we are.
[4348.22s -> 4354.92s]  Nondescript hotel hallway.
[4354.92s -> 4355.80s]  There's no map.
[4355.80s -> 4357.48s]  Like, I don't know where the fuck to go.
[4357.88s -> 4360.68s]  If I can press M and see where the fuck I'm supposed to go.
[4365.58s -> 4367.82s]  I'm just running around till I find the fucking elevator.
[4367.82s -> 4371.03s]  I'll just outrun him.
[4371.03s -> 4372.15s]  121...
[4372.15s -> 4375.58s]  122...
[4375.58s -> 4376.46s]  123...
[4383.21s -> 4384.17s]  The skips.
[4384.17s -> 4384.65s]  I'm done.
[4384.65s -> 4386.01s]  This game sucks.
[4386.01s -> 4386.57s]  The skips.
[4386.57s -> 4387.37s]  I hate this game.
[4387.37s -> 4388.17s]  It's stupid.
[4388.17s -> 4388.57s]  I'm done.
[4398.38s -> 4399.18s]  This guy sucks.
[4415.91s -> 4416.47s]  Uh-huh.
[4416.47s -> 4417.43s]  All right.
[4417.43s -> 4418.87s]  Now, what else did you take?
[4418.87s -> 4425.10s]  Can I please find a way to get to the fucking elevator?
[4425.10s -> 4427.90s]  It's not even the fucking scary bad guy that's a problem for me.
[4427.90s -> 4439.06s]  It's walking in a circle in a nondescript hotel room.
[4439.06s -> 4439.86s]  107.
[4439.86s -> 4440.66s]  All right.
[4440.66s -> 4441.46s]  Where do I go?
[4441.46s -> 4443.22s]  How do I get the fuck out of here?
[4447.38s -> 4448.10s]  Not this way.
[4448.10s -> 4448.34s]  All right.
[4448.34s -> 4455.11s]  What about the other way?
[4455.11s -> 4456.15s]  108.
[4456.15s -> 4463.26s]  How did I end up here again?
[4463.26s -> 4466.22s]  Where's the one hallway that leads back to the fucking lobby?
[4491.48s -> 4495.61s]  Where is the fucking elevator?
[4495.61s -> 4496.81s]  Where's the exit signs?
[4496.81s -> 4517.67s]  I'm going to fucking alt F4 this game.
[4517.67s -> 4518.55s]  Yay!
[4518.55s -> 4519.43s]  I found it.
[4519.43s -> 4520.39s]  Oh my god.
[4520.39s -> 4526.34s]  Why does this take me so fucking long?
[4526.34s -> 4526.66s]  All right.
[4526.66s -> 4530.38s]  Where is the storeroom?
[4530.38s -> 4531.98s]  They just looked on the security camera.
[4531.98s -> 4534.30s]  A guy just going in the same circle.
[4534.30s -> 4546.28s]  Give me this fucking thing back.
[4546.28s -> 4561.96s]  Now we get to play the game called
[4561.96s -> 4565.56s]  go try to find where the fucking scrying mirror is.
[4565.56s -> 4577.05s]  I'm going to third floor.
[4577.05s -> 4578.65s]  101 to 115 is that way.
[4578.65s -> 4579.05s]  Good luck.
[4579.05s -> 4579.85s]  I'm going to get lost.
[4584.49s -> 4586.57s]  101 to 115.
[4586.57s -> 4587.13s]  Okay.
[4587.13s -> 4593.83s]  Okay.
[4593.83s -> 4596.55s]  So where's 101 is this way, right?
[4596.55s -> 4599.29s]  I need to remember this thing.
[4599.29s -> 4599.53s]  All right.
[4599.53s -> 4601.67s]  So 101 is here.
[4601.67s -> 4605.45s]  This is 106.
[4605.45s -> 4606.01s]  What?
[4606.01s -> 4606.49s]  Wait.
[4606.49s -> 4607.29s]  Huh?
[4607.29s -> 4610.57s]  Where's 101?
[4613.24s -> 4614.60s]  This hotel sucks.
[4615.16s -> 4616.28s]  It's so confusing.
[4618.09s -> 4618.41s]  Huh?
[4619.40s -> 4619.80s]  Okay.
[4619.80s -> 4620.92s]  101.
[4620.92s -> 4631.86s]  103 is dark.
[4631.86s -> 4644.58s]  Please don't yell.
[4644.58s -> 4645.46s]  You're going to lose your voice.
[4645.46s -> 4646.02s]  All right.
[4646.02s -> 4646.58s]  You're right.
[4646.58s -> 4649.66s]  There it is.
[4649.66s -> 4655.27s]  This floor has a dead end.
[4655.27s -> 4656.54s]  Okay.
[4656.54s -> 4659.50s]  Either by in the door in rooms or in the ground floor kitchen.
[4659.50s -> 4662.89s]  Either by the door in rooms or.
[4662.89s -> 4663.21s]  Okay.
[4663.21s -> 4666.49s]  So I can use the mirror to see clues about where to go.
[4666.49s -> 4669.94s]  It will also help you locate lost keys.
[4669.94s -> 4672.36s]  Okay.
[4673.40s -> 4680.50s]  I got some items.
[4680.50s -> 4684.34s]  Use the mirror in the dark rooms.
[4684.90s -> 4714.33s]  Okay.
[4714.89s -> 4723.85s]  And I already do that though.
[4724.65s -> 4729.85s]  That was the little girl, right?
[4729.85s -> 4731.13s]  I already did that one.
[4731.13s -> 4739.43s]  This is hallway that I haven't gone through over here.
[4739.43s -> 4742.71s]  I might have some more stuff now.
[4742.71s -> 4744.65s]  Yeah.
[4744.65s -> 4746.73s]  Let me just finish exploring out here.
[4746.73s -> 4753.06s]  104.
[4753.86s -> 4759.46s]  Use it again.
[4764.36s -> 4764.84s]  Oh, shit.
[4764.84s -> 4765.56s]  Wait.
[4765.56s -> 4780.55s]  Don't use it too much.
[4781.35s -> 4782.23s]  Why is it bad?
[4782.23s -> 4804.20s]  There's one more that I haven't done.
[4804.20s -> 4805.40s]  Use it in a dark room.
[4805.40s -> 4811.96s]  Sorry.
[4815.22s -> 4817.62s]  Is he actually coming?
[4817.62s -> 4821.85s]  Oh, this is crying.
[4821.85s -> 4823.13s]  I can't believe I'm bald here.
[4824.23s -> 4824.55s]  Okay.
[4825.43s -> 4831.51s]  So I think I've seen everything in the first floor except for the dark rooms.
[4831.51s -> 4846.70s]  It's not right here, right?
[4846.70s -> 4848.76s]  Oh, don't open the door.
[4848.76s -> 4852.62s]  How do I bolt the door?
[4852.62s -> 4854.46s]  How do I bolt the door?
[4854.46s -> 4855.74s]  How do I bolt the door?
[4855.74s -> 4856.78s]  What's the button I do?
[4856.78s -> 4859.38s]  What room am I even in?
[4859.38s -> 4861.94s]  What room am I in?
[4865.70s -> 4868.33s]  How do I use the key?
[4868.33s -> 4868.89s]  105.
[4869.45s -> 4870.89s]  Can I press 105?
[4870.89s -> 4898.06s]  Did you press the talk button to do it?
[4898.06s -> 4899.64s]  105.
[4899.64s -> 4900.36s]  Oh, my God.
[4900.36s -> 4902.87s]  What a pain.
[4902.87s -> 4903.91s]  Do I even have it?
[4903.91s -> 4907.40s]  I don't even have the key to this room.
[4907.40s -> 4909.58s]  Okay.
[4909.58s -> 4910.30s]  Well, I'm leaving.
[4910.30s -> 4911.02s]  Let's go.
[4911.10s -> 4920.23s]  Okay.
[4920.23s -> 4921.99s]  Now I'm going back down.
[4921.99s -> 4933.37s]  Don't be here.
[4933.37s -> 4933.77s]  No.
[4933.77s -> 4937.27s]  Could be no.
[4937.27s -> 4942.54s]  Show the girl the new stuff.
[4942.54s -> 4947.48s]  That's the plan.
[4947.48s -> 4949.64s]  But wasn't there a dark room over here?
[4950.36s -> 4954.76s]  I don't care.
[4954.76s -> 4956.12s]  Let's just get me out of here.
[4957.93s -> 4966.78s]  My God.
[4966.78s -> 4967.90s]  Oh, my God.
[4968.62s -> 4979.48s]  Wait, I can lock this one.
[4979.48s -> 4988.74s]  Okay.
[4988.74s -> 4989.62s]  You can't get in now.
[4989.62s -> 4992.26s]  Fuck you.
[4992.26s -> 4993.14s]  You can't get in.
[4993.14s -> 4999.66s]  You can't get in.
[4999.66s -> 5000.63s]  I'm safe.
[5000.63s -> 5012.41s]  Now I just like taunt him.
[5016.66s -> 5017.94s]  Wouldn't he have a key?
[5017.94s -> 5019.77s]  He's like a weird guy.
[5019.77s -> 5021.05s]  Wouldn't he have like a...
[5021.05s -> 5021.45s]  I don't know.
[5021.45s -> 5023.29s]  I feel like he would have like a hotel key.
[5023.29s -> 5030.14s]  He like owns the hotel.
[5030.14s -> 5033.18s]  All right.
[5033.18s -> 5034.06s]  I think I'm getting out.
[5034.06s -> 5041.00s]  I'm not calling him out.
[5041.00s -> 5041.56s]  No.
[5041.56s -> 5043.19s]  Okay.
[5043.19s -> 5045.06s]  I just have to get to the elevator
[5045.06s -> 5046.02s]  and I'm going to go down.
[5046.02s -> 5046.58s]  Okay.
[5046.58s -> 5047.22s]  Let's go.
[5047.22s -> 5048.44s]  Unlock the door first.
[5048.44s -> 5048.84s]  Oh.
[5048.84s -> 5063.69s]  Okay.
[5063.69s -> 5064.09s]  I gotta...
[5065.13s -> 5066.95s]  Where are you?
[5066.95s -> 5067.43s]  No.
[5067.43s -> 5067.83s]  No.
[5067.83s -> 5069.83s]  Why are you in the same exact spot, man?
[5069.83s -> 5072.33s]  You're in the exact same spot.
[5072.33s -> 5073.05s]  Oh, my God.
[5073.05s -> 5073.53s]  Get in.
[5073.53s -> 5074.41s]  I don't know.
[5074.41s -> 5076.09s]  I didn't want to click on that.
[5076.09s -> 5076.97s]  I didn't want to click on that.
[5076.97s -> 5082.22s]  I swear to God.
[5082.22s -> 5083.98s]  He's camping the elevator.
[5083.98s -> 5110.55s]  Oh, this is bad.
[5110.55s -> 5112.07s]  Oh, my God.
[5112.07s -> 5113.11s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[5114.02s -> 5114.82s]  No, not this.
[5115.46s -> 5121.37s]  I just came out.
[5121.37s -> 5122.09s]  Click.
[5122.09s -> 5124.01s]  Oh, my God.
[5124.01s -> 5127.13s]  I wish I could have a solution to this issue.
[5128.33s -> 5130.86s]  Do I have the key for 107?
[5130.86s -> 5131.18s]  I don't.
[5131.18s -> 5131.58s]  I don't know.
[5131.58s -> 5132.62s]  Just fucking hide in the bathroom.
[5137.59s -> 5138.47s]  I'm dead.
[5138.47s -> 5139.03s]  I'm just dead.
[5143.82s -> 5145.50s]  There's no way he doesn't know I'm in here.
[5145.50s -> 5146.06s]  He's going to just...
[5146.06s -> 5146.62s]  I'm dead.
[5146.62s -> 5147.02s]  It's over.
[5151.30s -> 5151.62s]  Yeah.
[5151.62s -> 5152.02s]  I know.
[5152.02s -> 5152.90s]  You know I'm in here.
[5152.90s -> 5153.54s]  Of course you do.
[5153.54s -> 5154.98s]  There's no way you don't open this door.
[5162.22s -> 5162.70s]  Bullshit.
[5162.70s -> 5163.10s]  He's not...
[5163.10s -> 5163.58s]  He's still there.
[5167.06s -> 5167.94s]  And now, again,
[5169.58s -> 5170.86s]  every time I see this guy,
[5170.86s -> 5174.70s]  my memory wipes the entire floor plan of this hotel.
[5174.70s -> 5196.92s]  Get me to the fucking elevator.
[5196.92s -> 5198.68s]  Where is the elevator from here?
[5198.68s -> 5200.79s]  Okay, this is 107.
[5200.79s -> 5201.59s]  It's like...
[5201.59s -> 5203.19s]  I got to go around here.
[5204.50s -> 5205.86s]  No, this is wrong.
[5205.86s -> 5206.42s]  It's...
[5206.42s -> 5208.98s]  There's like a little tiny entryway that I go down,
[5208.98s -> 5210.86s]  which is right here.
[5212.36s -> 5212.68s]  Right?
[5212.68s -> 5213.16s]  No.
[5213.16s -> 5213.48s]  Is it?
[5214.04s -> 5217.06s]  Is this correct?
[5217.06s -> 5218.50s]  No, it's not correct.
[5218.50s -> 5220.90s]  There's one hallway that leads to the elevator,
[5220.90s -> 5222.50s]  and I still fucking find where it is.
[5222.50s -> 5225.02s]  There's literally one hallway that goes there.
[5227.54s -> 5228.34s]  It's this one right here.
[5228.98s -> 5231.72s]  Is it this one?
[5235.88s -> 5237.56s]  No, this is the fucking suit of armor.
[5239.61s -> 5240.57s]  I don't care!
[5240.57s -> 5241.77s]  Fucking come face me!
[5242.41s -> 5250.14s]  It's literally...
[5250.14s -> 5251.42s]  I'm following the exit signs.
[5251.98s -> 5254.54s]  There's one hallway I have to find.
[5255.26s -> 5262.58s]  The exit signs are the green sign of the guy going like this, right?
[5262.58s -> 5276.84s]  It's the arrows.
[5276.84s -> 5278.44s]  I know, but then I go that way,
[5278.44s -> 5279.96s]  and that's the only sign there is,
[5279.96s -> 5281.56s]  and then I just go walking around in a circle.
[5281.56s -> 5282.68s]  I don't know where I am.
[5282.68s -> 5283.88s]  It's a concrete level.
[5283.88s -> 5285.48s]  Why would I play the game with the hotel rooms?
[5285.48s -> 5339.05s]  Fuck you, guy.
[5340.58s -> 5341.38s]  Okay, let's talk.
[5348.22s -> 5348.78s]  Who's there?
[5349.34s -> 5354.74s]  Okay, I have new things to show you.
[5354.74s -> 5355.86s]  What do you think about this?
[5358.60s -> 5359.24s]  Is it Amy?
[5371.40s -> 5372.92s]  Who did the Charles Perth belong to?
[5383.86s -> 5386.60s]  Where did the bottle of diazepam come from?
[5392.79s -> 5395.35s]  Why is there a blood-stained cloth in one of the drawers?
[5396.07s -> 5404.68s]  Okay, so now...
[5405.40s -> 5420.23s]  Okay, it said blood-stained cloth.
[5420.23s -> 5423.69s]  All right, so you can only select two things at once.
[5428.41s -> 5431.50s]  Okay, I don't think we learned anything new.
[5432.30s -> 5435.11s]  Select two things.
[5437.58s -> 5438.78s]  You have to pair things.
[5438.78s -> 5443.00s]  Okay, so this is yours?
[5443.00s -> 5443.72s]  Is it Amy?
[5446.87s -> 5456.20s]  The blood-stained cloth and the purse?
[5457.42s -> 5458.14s]  All right, I mean that's...
[5459.16s -> 5462.20s]  Match two replies you think connect to work out the spirit story.
[5462.92s -> 5464.63s]  I mean, is that...
[5465.35s -> 5466.66s]  Okay.
[5467.38s -> 5471.18s]  Pair sighting replies with item replies for faster progress.
[5474.02s -> 5474.34s]  Okay.
[5478.90s -> 5480.02s]  Sighting replies and...
[5480.66s -> 5482.39s]  Amy doesn't have an answer.
[5482.95s -> 5488.07s]  And the sword?
[5488.71s -> 5490.55s]  Cloth could have been mine.
[5491.27s -> 5491.75s]  Had the sword.
[5491.75s -> 5492.39s]  I didn't like it.
[5492.95s -> 5494.38s]  Like that?
[5495.02s -> 5502.04s]  How do I like say yes to this?
[5502.76s -> 5507.08s]  Pair sighting...
[5507.08s -> 5512.47s]  Okay, the sword and the purse and Jimmy stealing.
[5513.03s -> 5517.06s]  The purse was mine.
[5517.06s -> 5518.58s]  It was my birthday, but it was stolen.
[5518.58s -> 5518.82s]  Okay.
[5519.78s -> 5522.25s]  But pair that with what?
[5522.97s -> 5531.19s]  Cloth could have been mine.
[5531.19s -> 5531.91s]  How do we know that?
[5537.05s -> 5537.77s]  Showing keys.
[5538.41s -> 5539.21s]  Showing everything.
[5544.02s -> 5545.06s]  Settings, not items.
[5545.62s -> 5549.51s]  Okay.
[5549.51s -> 5551.51s]  Boy called Jimmy locked me in the basement.
[5551.51s -> 5553.11s]  Then he started stealing things from me.
[5553.11s -> 5555.35s]  And the purse was mine and it was stolen from me.
[5555.35s -> 5557.03s]  When you said Jimmy stole things from you.
[5557.03s -> 5557.35s]  Okay.
[5557.35s -> 5559.51s]  Is that connected with what you said about the purse?
[5560.47s -> 5570.68s]  Okay.
[5587.27s -> 5588.55s]  So now go to the ground floor.
[5590.09s -> 5590.49s]  Hello.
[5591.83s -> 5593.11s]  Okay, Jimmy wouldn't listen.
[5593.83s -> 5597.59s]  Okay.
[5598.23s -> 5600.50s]  We're going up to the ground floor.
[5601.14s -> 5604.57s]  And then we're going to follow the...
[5606.65s -> 5606.97s]  Campus.
[5607.69s -> 5634.04s]  What is going on?
[5643.30s -> 5644.90s]  Jimmy, give it back.
[5644.90s -> 5646.02s]  That's mine.
[5646.02s -> 5648.26s]  Stop stealing on this.
[5648.26s -> 5657.19s]  Should we talk?
[5660.57s -> 5661.61s]  Is it Amy?
[5662.33s -> 5666.74s]  All right.
[5666.74s -> 5668.26s]  So stealing...
[5670.09s -> 5672.41s]  I saw you shouting to Jimmy to give your toy back.
[5673.37s -> 5674.25s]  Why did he take it?
[5674.97s -> 5679.61s]  That doesn't help.
[5680.17s -> 5680.89s]  That was funny.
[5686.02s -> 5686.74s]  Okay.
[5686.74s -> 5690.15s]  Stealing my toy.
[5690.71s -> 5708.95s]  Is there anything else I can need to do?
[5709.67s -> 5721.10s]  I'm gonna find the toy.
[5721.10s -> 5725.53s]  Wait, scrying machine.
[5725.53s -> 5739.61s]  I'm gonna find the toy.
[5739.61s -> 5741.53s]  You know, I haven't been up to the third floor
[5741.53s -> 5742.57s]  in a long time.
[5742.57s -> 5747.21s]  Let's go to the third floor.
[5747.21s -> 5753.24s]  Third floor is the only one that I really...
[5758.12s -> 5760.38s]  Have not really looked around.
[5760.94s -> 5783.19s]  Let's go 309, 308.
[5783.19s -> 5789.16s]  That one...
[5789.16s -> 5796.10s]  I feel like these were...
[5796.10s -> 5797.38s]  One of these was dark.
[5797.38s -> 5797.86s]  Right?
[5797.86s -> 5801.51s]  Did I get everything from here?
[5801.51s -> 5806.14s]  Yeah, this is where the goodbye was.
[5806.14s -> 5808.31s]  One of these was dark.
[5808.31s -> 5819.96s]  Which one was dark?
[5823.48s -> 5824.60s]  I just came out of this one.
[5824.60s -> 5827.06s]  Yeah.
[5827.78s -> 5828.34s]  All right.
[5828.34s -> 5829.62s]  You know why it's confusing?
[5829.62s -> 5833.06s]  Okay.
[5833.06s -> 5833.62s]  Yeah.
[5833.62s -> 5834.42s]  Because I'm turning...
[5834.42s -> 5835.14s]  All right.
[5835.14s -> 5837.22s]  My brain wants to open the door.
[5837.22s -> 5839.14s]  This is what's causing all these issues for me.
[5839.14s -> 5839.94s]  When I open the door,
[5839.94s -> 5842.02s]  I'm imagining that 308 will be in front of me,
[5842.02s -> 5844.26s]  but I keep turning and putting my back
[5844.26s -> 5846.66s]  and the door that I just came out of is in front of me.
[5846.66s -> 5848.52s]  You know what I mean?
[5848.52s -> 5852.70s]  Like when I open 309, it's like, all right, 308.
[5852.70s -> 5854.82s]  But you turn your body.
[5854.82s -> 5856.66s]  That's what keeps happening to me.
[5856.66s -> 5858.60s]  I figured it out.
[5858.60s -> 5860.20s]  Now I know why I'm so fucking lost.
[5861.16s -> 5863.88s]  All right.
[5863.88s -> 5864.68s]  None of these were dark.
[5866.86s -> 5867.74s]  I already got that.
[5867.74s -> 5868.06s]  Okay.
[5868.06s -> 5868.38s]  Yeah.
[5868.38s -> 5869.42s]  No, I did everything here.
[5871.99s -> 5888.12s]  Crime is skyrocketing.
[5888.12s -> 5888.68s]  Okay.
[5888.68s -> 5891.75s]  So now let me check these.
[5898.66s -> 5899.38s]  302.
[5899.38s -> 5899.62s]  All right.
[5899.62s -> 5900.42s]  302 is dark.
[5901.06s -> 5903.10s]  Do I have the key to 302?
[5903.10s -> 5903.58s]  Why would I?
[5905.22s -> 5905.78s]  No.
[5905.78s -> 5906.58s]  Scry.
[5906.58s -> 5933.27s]  Is that water?
[5933.27s -> 5942.06s]  Found G.
[5942.70s -> 5950.57s]  Okay.
[5950.57s -> 5951.45s]  G again.
[5951.45s -> 5953.34s]  Well, isn't that where...
[5953.34s -> 5955.34s]  We're on like the little girl's quest, right?
[5955.34s -> 5956.98s]  We need to find a toy.
[5956.98s -> 5961.18s]  It's turpentine.
[5963.61s -> 5964.17s]  Shit.
[5964.17s -> 5976.12s]  Okay.
[5976.12s -> 5979.59s]  Do I have enough to know what happened?
[5979.59s -> 5985.26s]  Do I just have to go down and put the right stuff
[5985.26s -> 5986.14s]  when I talk to Amy?
[5986.14s -> 5989.70s]  I think I already have everything, don't I?
[5990.41s -> 5992.01s]  I need a toy though.
[5992.01s -> 5995.61s]  I need to find the toy.
[5995.61s -> 5996.73s]  Oh, shit.
[5996.73s -> 5997.13s]  Okay.
[5997.13s -> 5997.61s]  He's coming.
[5998.17s -> 6020.23s]  I will have explored the entire third floor after this.
[6020.23s -> 6022.76s]  Should I just get out here and run?
[6022.76s -> 6023.99s]  Where is he?
[6023.99s -> 6025.03s]  Why is he just standing here?
[6025.03s -> 6033.18s]  Whatever.
[6033.18s -> 6034.22s]  I'm just gonna go.
[6034.22s -> 6038.97s]  Okay.
[6038.97s -> 6040.57s]  So don't get turned around.
[6040.57s -> 6043.93s]  So this is very dark.
[6060.74s -> 6062.66s]  I'm not going to scream again for the rest of the night.
[6062.66s -> 6063.38s]  I promise.
[6063.38s -> 6083.00s]  What did you take?
[6083.00s -> 6083.72s]  Did you take something?
[6086.65s -> 6087.85s]  I don't even know what you took.
[6088.41s -> 6091.21s]  Fucking radio again.
[6091.77s -> 6093.77s]  First floor store near the stairs.
[6099.86s -> 6101.22s]  I knew he was behind me too.
[6101.22s -> 6106.47s]  I just didn't want to turn and have it hit me in the head.
[6106.47s -> 6107.51s]  Okay.
[6107.51s -> 6109.67s]  So have I...
[6109.67s -> 6110.90s]  Where am I now?
[6113.85s -> 6115.05s]  I'm on the first floor right now.
[6115.05s -> 6115.77s]  Okay.
[6115.77s -> 6123.21s]  I need a sign to tell me where I'm going.
[6123.21s -> 6124.58s]  Where's the exit sign?
[6141.88s -> 6142.28s]  You know what?
[6142.28s -> 6144.28s]  It's this floor here.
[6144.28s -> 6146.49s]  This is the problem for my head.
[6146.49s -> 6147.45s]  This place.
[6147.45s -> 6152.82s]  It's like fucking nine paths.
[6152.82s -> 6154.50s]  No, I need to get the thing from here.
[6155.22s -> 6161.32s]  It's right here.
[6161.32s -> 6168.49s]  What is this?
[6168.49s -> 6169.21s]  This is open now.
[6172.38s -> 6182.34s]  Can I touch this?
[6182.34s -> 6195.45s]  Give that back.
[6195.45s -> 6196.01s]  No.
[6196.01s -> 6212.74s]  What's in here?
[6212.74s -> 6216.98s]  There's nothing here.
[6216.98s -> 6221.54s]  Is someone there?
[6226.58s -> 6234.42s]  No, there's nothing.
[6234.42s -> 6235.06s]  Okay.
[6235.06s -> 6236.98s]  I'm going to go to...
[6238.54s -> 6238.86s]  Two?
[6242.60s -> 6244.04s]  I have the key to the stairs.
[6247.67s -> 6251.24s]  Go to G.
[6251.24s -> 6253.08s]  I feel like I was already there like three times.
[6253.08s -> 6254.68s]  Do I have the key to the stairs?
[6265.08s -> 6267.75s]  So, I mean, should I...
[6267.75s -> 6269.66s]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[6270.46s -> 6271.90s]  He can't be in there, right?
[6271.98s -> 6275.18s]  I'm going to G, I guess.
[6281.27s -> 6287.62s]  Stairs are safe.
[6287.62s -> 6287.94s]  Yeah.
[6296.60s -> 6297.88s]  Going back to that room.
[6298.44s -> 6299.32s]  Talk to her again.
[6299.32s -> 6299.96s]  See if I can't.
[6303.53s -> 6304.01s]  Right?
[6304.01s -> 6304.33s]  I mean...
[6306.44s -> 6307.32s]  Wait, hold on.
[6307.32s -> 6308.71s]  I can't go in here?
[6308.71s -> 6309.35s]  Come on.
[6309.35s -> 6313.53s]  What about this room?
[6314.09s -> 6315.27s]  Can I do anything in here?
[6316.95s -> 6317.35s]  Hold on.
[6336.22s -> 6339.08s]  All right.
[6339.08s -> 6340.84s]  Perpentine on the bear.
[6340.84s -> 6342.12s]  That's a bear, right?
[6342.12s -> 6359.26s]  I don't have a bear though.
[6359.26s -> 6364.86s]  Okay.
[6364.86s -> 6368.18s]  So, not that way.
[6368.18s -> 6371.02s]  What's right here?
[6371.02s -> 6371.50s]  Okay.
[6371.50s -> 6373.42s]  So, can I talk to you about this?
[6377.54s -> 6378.34s]  Is anyone there?
[6383.62s -> 6384.18s]  Okay.
[6384.18s -> 6391.48s]  So, the turpentine...
[6391.48s -> 6392.12s]  Is it Amy?
[6394.65s -> 6395.61s]  I don't have a bear though.
[6404.12s -> 6405.24s]  I probably need to find a bear.
[6417.40s -> 6418.36s]  Stealing?
[6418.36s -> 6420.79s]  Like that?
[6421.35s -> 6423.42s]  Does that make sense?
[6423.42s -> 6425.74s]  What you said about Jimmy stealing your toy.
[6425.74s -> 6428.94s]  Does that have something to do with what you said about the turpentine and lighter?
[6430.81s -> 6431.13s]  Yeah.
[6438.52s -> 6438.84s]  Right.
[6440.12s -> 6445.34s]  The one.
[6446.55s -> 6446.87s]  All right.
[6446.87s -> 6447.27s]  Let's go.
[6449.59s -> 6450.07s]  Now.
[6452.89s -> 6453.61s]  Okay.
[6453.61s -> 6454.17s]  Floor one.
[6454.73s -> 6465.64s]  Is there anything else I can do here?
[6466.28s -> 6466.84s]  Probably not.
[6466.84s -> 6467.80s]  Let's just get to floor one.
[6470.10s -> 6472.02s]  I have to complete at least one quest in this game.
[6474.55s -> 6482.57s]  It's your favorite floor.
[6483.45s -> 6498.38s]  All right.
[6498.38s -> 6499.42s]  We're gonna drop the...
[6499.42s -> 6500.70s]  I mean, it's getting to be a little darker.
[6500.70s -> 6501.66s]  Let's go ahead and drop this.
[6502.22s -> 6512.55s]  It's time for lights off by the way.
[6512.55s -> 6521.86s]  Adjust this.
[6521.86s -> 6529.85s]  That work?
[6529.85s -> 6530.41s]  Kind of.
[6530.41s -> 6544.23s]  Okay.
[6544.23s -> 6545.40s]  There we go.
[6545.96s -> 6551.34s]  Scary.
[6551.90s -> 6554.94s]  This is too...
[6554.94s -> 6556.22s]  This is like way too bright.
[6556.22s -> 6562.09s]  Hold on.
[6562.09s -> 6563.21s]  Now I'm immersed.
[6563.21s -> 6568.09s]  Dorito.
[6568.09s -> 6568.73s]  Dorito.
[6568.73s -> 6569.13s]  Yeah.
[6569.13s -> 6569.77s]  I know.
[6569.77s -> 6570.41s]  I know.
[6570.41s -> 6584.58s]  I've only done seven percent of the game.
[6584.58s -> 6585.30s]  I've only...
[6585.30s -> 6590.39s]  Seven percent?
[6590.39s -> 6591.03s]  What?
[6591.03s -> 6592.78s]  You've got to be shitting me.
[6592.78s -> 6593.34s]  Okay.
[6593.34s -> 6608.68s]  Where is this pointing to?
[6608.68s -> 6615.80s]  Is anyone there?
[6615.80s -> 6620.31s]  Floor one.
[6620.31s -> 6620.71s]  Where's the...
[6620.71s -> 6621.43s]  Where's this...
[6621.43s -> 6622.07s]  I don't...
[6622.07s -> 6632.17s]  This way.
[6632.17s -> 6632.97s]  But it keeps going.
[6633.85s -> 6634.41s]  Stairs?
[6635.13s -> 6646.98s]  Play the Ghostbusters game.
[6646.98s -> 6647.62s]  Ah.
[6647.62s -> 6652.82s]  Or the mirror.
[6652.82s -> 6654.50s]  Let's head first floor.
[6654.50s -> 6657.83s]  Can Jerma see us?
[6657.83s -> 6658.55s]  Yeah, I can.
[6658.55s -> 6668.30s]  Follow the arrow.
[6668.30s -> 6679.19s]  Yeah, the arrow just is spinning in a circle.
[6679.19s -> 6680.71s]  It's like here?
[6680.79s -> 6681.51s]  In this room?
[6681.51s -> 6683.11s]  Are you in like in 106 or something?
[6683.11s -> 6694.74s]  I don't think so.
[6694.74s -> 6695.70s]  Is anyone there?
[6695.70s -> 6713.40s]  Fuck you, man.
[6713.40s -> 6713.88s]  Seriously.
[6715.93s -> 6716.25s]  No.
[6716.25s -> 6717.29s]  I want to turn.
[6717.29s -> 6718.09s]  I want to turn.
[6718.09s -> 6718.49s]  I...
[6718.49s -> 6719.69s]  I wish I could just do WASD.
[6720.25s -> 6721.75s]  I'm gonna die.
[6721.75s -> 6733.94s]  Okay.
[6733.94s -> 6759.38s]  Here he comes.
[6759.38s -> 6759.86s]  Is he gone?
[6762.28s -> 6765.19s]  He's not gone.
[6765.19s -> 6772.52s]  All right.
[6772.52s -> 6775.16s]  Come on up next to play and stay out of the house.
[6775.16s -> 6776.94s]  The puppet combo game.
[6776.94s -> 6777.66s]  Be aware.
[6777.66s -> 6779.56s]  Probably loud as fuck.
[6779.56s -> 6799.08s]  I want to at least complete this mission with the little girl.
[6799.08s -> 6810.41s]  I think I'm going out.
[6810.41s -> 6813.56s]  Yeah, I'm just gonna go out.
[6813.56s -> 6816.12s]  He hasn't done it yet.
[6816.12s -> 6822.89s]  He's seriously coming back.
[6822.89s -> 6846.84s]  Bro, when I unlock the door, you're coming over.
[6846.84s -> 6848.60s]  I mean, if he's just gonna sit here, then I need to...
[6848.60s -> 6849.32s]  What am I gonna do?
[6849.32s -> 6850.84s]  I have to leave at some point.
[6850.84s -> 6855.35s]  All right.
[6855.35s -> 6855.67s]  You know what?
[6855.67s -> 6856.39s]  Fuck this guy.
[6856.39s -> 6857.03s]  I'm just going.
[6857.03s -> 6858.79s]  Like he's gonna stand here this whole time.
[6858.79s -> 6868.79s]  Compass is pointing over there, but there's no way to go over there.
[6876.25s -> 6882.12s]  Huh?
[6882.12s -> 6883.24s]  Why is it doing that?
[6883.24s -> 6891.05s]  109?
[6892.02s -> 6893.38s]  Are you in here or something?
[6893.38s -> 6894.18s]  What's in here?
[6894.18s -> 6898.68s]  This is where the sword is, right?
[6898.68s -> 6898.92s]  Yep.
[6899.94s -> 6900.50s]  Um.
[6900.50s -> 6906.36s]  Is someone there?
[6906.36s -> 6907.69s]  It's loud in here.
[6914.82s -> 6920.60s]  I don't think there's anything in here.
[6920.60s -> 6920.84s]  All right.
[6920.84s -> 6922.20s]  I'm gonna give this game five more minutes.
[6922.20s -> 6933.00s]  And then I'm playing the other one.
[6933.00s -> 6934.04s]  Pointing this way?
[6934.04s -> 6934.28s]  No.
[6934.28s -> 6935.72s]  Where is this arrow pointing?
[6935.72s -> 6941.37s]  It is pointing in here.
[6941.37s -> 6943.48s]  I couldn't do anything in there.
[6943.48s -> 6954.25s]  Why does it want me to go in here?
[6954.81s -> 6964.57s]  Not like right here, right?
[6964.57s -> 6965.77s]  There's something there.
[6965.77s -> 6969.30s]  Should I do the mirror in here?
[6969.30s -> 6970.62s]  Let's try it.
[6970.62s -> 6980.28s]  There's nothing in this room.
[6980.28s -> 6981.00s]  Just the sword.
[6982.06s -> 6982.86s]  Um.
[6982.86s -> 6983.34s]  I'll do the...
[6983.34s -> 6983.98s]  I'll do the mirror?
[6984.70s -> 7004.47s]  109.
[7004.47s -> 7005.67s]  Isn't that where I am?
[7005.67s -> 7009.18s]  109.
[7009.18s -> 7011.80s]  That's where I'm standing.
[7011.80s -> 7025.54s]  Look around.
[7025.54s -> 7027.02s]  I mean, this...
[7028.09s -> 7030.01s]  I can literally only look in two directions.
[7030.01s -> 7030.51s]  Ah!
[7032.09s -> 7035.05s]  I fucked this game.
[7035.05s -> 7035.93s]  I'm playing something else.
[7037.13s -> 7038.09s]  I'm playing a different game.
[7042.89s -> 7044.89s]  Why did that not happen the first time I...
[7044.89s -> 7045.37s]  Okay.
[7045.37s -> 7048.89s]  Why did that not happen when I walked in here two minutes ago?
[7048.89s -> 7059.98s]  Is it Amy?
[7059.98s -> 7060.62s]  Yeah.
[7060.62s -> 7061.66s]  It's me, Amy.
[7062.62s -> 7062.94s]  Okay.
[7063.74s -> 7066.39s]  I saw you holding a toy on fire.
[7066.95s -> 7067.83s]  What happened?
[7067.83s -> 7082.25s]  The cloth and the sword.
[7082.25s -> 7084.84s]  Okay.
[7085.48s -> 7086.52s]  Sword, blood...
[7087.64s -> 7088.44s]  What was that?
[7088.44s -> 7089.16s]  Who's this guy?
[7092.41s -> 7093.61s]  Sword and bloody cloth?
[7097.26s -> 7098.78s]  Sword and cloth, right?
[7100.22s -> 7100.78s]  Who's there?
[7107.99s -> 7108.47s]  Hello?
[7108.47s -> 7109.98s]  It's gone.
[7109.98s -> 7110.54s]  Okay.
[7110.54s -> 7115.30s]  All right.
[7115.30s -> 7116.02s]  This game's scary.
[7116.02s -> 7116.82s]  This game's fucked up.
[7120.09s -> 7127.29s]  This game is very long.
[7127.29s -> 7135.98s]  I want me to go to floor two.
[7135.98s -> 7139.24s]  This game's scary.
[7139.24s -> 7148.98s]  It still said floor one, though.
[7151.24s -> 7154.23s]  Where are you?
[7154.23s -> 7163.88s]  It still wanted me on floor one.
[7163.88s -> 7171.53s]  Uh-oh.
[7174.62s -> 7183.35s]  I'm done with it.
[7183.35s -> 7183.75s]  This is...
[7183.75s -> 7184.95s]  This is scary.
[7184.95s -> 7185.83s]  This is awful.
[7185.83s -> 7189.37s]  It was an awful experience.
[7189.37s -> 7190.65s]  I recommend it.
[7190.65s -> 7195.62s]  That was a horrible experience.
[7195.62s -> 7196.58s]  Would recommend.
[7196.58s -> 7212.17s]  Down here.
[7218.02s -> 7218.52s]  This way.
[7223.88s -> 7224.38s]  Jimmy?
[7224.38s -> 7224.88s]  Jimmy?
[7228.04s -> 7228.28s]  All right.
[7228.28s -> 7229.88s]  Let's play the next one.
[7229.88s -> 7231.12s]  Let's play the next one.
[7232.83s -> 7233.55s]  In just a second.
[7237.04s -> 7245.10s]  Where is she?
[7245.10s -> 7256.81s]  Where are you?
[7256.81s -> 7263.80s]  Where are you?
[7263.80s -> 7264.60s]  Hey, hey, hey!
[7264.60s -> 7265.88s]  I'm telling you, Jimmy.
[7265.88s -> 7267.08s]  You can't do that.
[7267.08s -> 7267.58s]  You're home.
[7289.93s -> 7291.05s]  Oh, I don't have my...
[7291.05s -> 7292.25s]  I don't have my thing.
[7292.25s -> 7298.00s]  I can't communicate.
[7298.00s -> 7298.32s]  All right.
[7298.32s -> 7299.20s]  This game was scary.
[7299.20s -> 7299.60s]  This was...
[7299.60s -> 7299.84s]  All right.
[7299.84s -> 7301.15s]  That was cool.
[7301.15s -> 7301.95s]  That was cool.
[7301.95s -> 7304.24s]  That was...
[7304.24s -> 7305.76s]  That was confusing for me.
[7305.76s -> 7307.34s]  But it was a good game.
[7307.34s -> 7310.70s]  We're gonna move on to the puppet combo game.
[7310.70s -> 7313.32s]  That was intense.
[7313.32s -> 7317.82s]  Give me one sec.
[7319.68s -> 7322.17s]  Only 7% of the game completed, too.
[7322.17s -> 7322.97s]  Holy shit.
