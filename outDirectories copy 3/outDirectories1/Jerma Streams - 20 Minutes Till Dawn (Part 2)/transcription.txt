[1.27s -> 4.73s]  Okay, let's play, uh, I have a controller, period.
[4.73s -> 9.61s]  20 minutes till dawn. If you've never played this before, if you like vampire survivors, this game is...
[9.61s -> 11.69s]  No, no, no controller, no controller, that's right.
[11.69s -> 20.30s]  This game is kind of like vampire survivors. It's very fun.
[20.30s -> 24.22s]  Are any mods around to change the game to, um, 20 minutes till dawn?
[24.22s -> 35.78s]  Are you gonna play VR?
[36.42s -> 37.30s]  No, not for a while.
[51.30s -> 52.90s]  Capture it or what?
[54.26s -> 58.18s]  There you go.
[58.18s -> 74.54s]  Okay, so 20 minutes till dawn is a game where you play as a, uh,
[74.94s -> 79.54s]  you're in the middle and you walk around and you shoot stuff.
[79.54s -> 82.84s]  It's really good, it's really fun.
[82.84s -> 87.27s]  We'll give this, like, half an hour.
[87.27s -> 89.53s]  Can you show the game list again?
[89.53s -> 92.23s]  Um, I don't have a way to do that.
[92.23s -> 95.99s]  All right, so I want to play with, uh, what's a good thing to play with?
[95.99s -> 97.03s]  I unlocked a few things.
[97.03s -> 99.18s]  What should I do?
[99.18s -> 100.55s]  Do 20 minutes.
[100.55s -> 106.12s]  Maybe 20, 25, 30, maybe 40, maybe an hour.
[106.12s -> 107.72s]  All right, can reroll upgrades?
[107.72s -> 109.32s]  Uh, it starts with very high HP.
[110.20s -> 113.75s]  Play it for 20 minutes.
[113.75s -> 114.07s]  We'll see.
[115.43s -> 116.39s]  All right, your bullets have...
[117.67s -> 118.39s]  All right, um...
[119.72s -> 121.69s]  What should I do for a weapon?
[121.69s -> 122.33s]  Bat gun?
[122.33s -> 124.01s]  Shoot bats that chase down enemies.
[124.01s -> 125.53s]  Bats are both bullets and summons.
[126.09s -> 126.81s]  Sure, I'll try it.
[127.90s -> 133.53s]  With, uh, you.
[133.53s -> 134.73s]  What about my runes?
[135.29s -> 142.15s]  Sounds good to me.
[142.15s -> 148.78s]  All right, let's play.
[148.78s -> 149.90s]  Standard mode.
[149.90s -> 152.81s]  Oh, should I activate this?
[152.81s -> 155.53s]  Small enemies spawn more often and small enemies have more HP.
[155.53s -> 157.05s]  I feel like that's kind of going to be hard.
[157.05s -> 159.74s]  I'm going for it.
[159.74s -> 160.24s]  Fuck it.
[165.91s -> 167.03s]  It's kind of loud.
[167.03s -> 171.64s]  Let me help you there.
[171.64s -> 173.16s]  This game is sick, by the way.
[173.16s -> 179.62s]  Is there a dodge roll?
[179.62s -> 183.29s]  I forgot.
[183.29s -> 184.25s]  No, there isn't.
[184.25s -> 185.29s]  No, no, no, there's not.
[185.29s -> 197.10s]  All right, the bat is pretty fun.
[197.10s -> 205.30s]  20 minutes of this?
[205.30s -> 205.70s]  Maybe?
[205.70s -> 206.10s]  I don't know.
[206.82s -> 210.82s]  Hey, guys, this is Omega Gaming Weekend.
[212.14s -> 215.82s]  I did not title this stream the next few days.
[219.14s -> 220.74s]  That's not what the title says.
[220.74s -> 226.23s]  That's not what it says on the title.
[226.23s -> 227.59s]  Definitely projectiles.
[227.59s -> 229.11s]  100% projectiles.
[229.11s -> 234.71s]  This is going to be three, right?
[234.71s -> 249.58s]  Oh, are you going to bet on this one?
[253.66s -> 254.70s]  Actually, don't bet on this one.
[254.70s -> 256.22s]  All right, these are summons.
[256.22s -> 258.82s]  Additional bullet.
[258.82s -> 261.96s]  After shooting your last ammo, smite nearby enemies.
[261.96s -> 262.60s]  That's pretty good.
[262.60s -> 264.04s]  Bullet damage.
[264.04s -> 265.96s]  That's pretty good.
[265.96s -> 267.16s]  That's really good.
[267.16s -> 269.51s]  Ghost friend is really good.
[269.51s -> 272.89s]  Summoning bullets.
[272.89s -> 275.66s]  I think I'm going to do this.
[275.66s -> 276.86s]  Stop reloading.
[276.86s -> 279.16s]  I have auto reload.
[279.16s -> 287.29s]  I have auto reload turned on.
[287.29s -> 289.21s]  Reload can be canceled in the middle of a reload.
[289.21s -> 291.22s]  So I'm going to keep it on.
[291.22s -> 292.18s]  That's actually really helpful.
[292.18s -> 298.84s]  This is good so far.
[298.84s -> 302.26s]  So far, so good.
[302.26s -> 303.06s]  Maybe?
[303.06s -> 303.70s]  No.
[303.70s -> 305.14s]  Plus one projectile.
[305.70s -> 306.18s]  Spread.
[306.18s -> 306.98s]  Don't really care.
[306.98s -> 308.02s]  Doubles base projectile.
[308.02s -> 309.22s]  Whoa, yeah.
[319.27s -> 321.51s]  I really hope that whoever is betting right now,
[321.51s -> 322.87s]  you're betting on the right thing.
[322.87s -> 325.27s]  Because it's not possible to lose now.
[325.27s -> 351.53s]  It's not possible for me to lose.
[351.53s -> 352.09s]  I'll be fine.
[352.09s -> 352.89s]  Don't worry.
[352.89s -> 367.50s]  All right, I need something big here.
[373.32s -> 374.68s]  Burn for three seconds.
[374.68s -> 375.72s]  Reload rate.
[375.72s -> 377.46s]  Huge.
[377.46s -> 378.58s]  Shield is huge.
[378.58s -> 383.85s]  Bullets can do curse.
[383.85s -> 384.57s]  That's pretty good.
[384.57s -> 388.63s]  It's probably burn.
[388.63s -> 390.95s]  But it also might be reload rate.
[390.95s -> 391.67s]  Could be.
[391.67s -> 394.14s]  I'll do burn.
[394.14s -> 410.07s]  It's bouncing around a lot.
[410.07s -> 411.11s]  Magic lens.
[411.11s -> 411.67s]  Nah.
[411.67s -> 413.14s]  That one's not bad.
[413.14s -> 415.06s]  Every second shot, lightning strikes.
[415.06s -> 417.37s]  When shooting your last ammo,
[417.37s -> 419.05s]  10 bullets go in a circle.
[419.05s -> 420.86s]  Pretty big.
[420.86s -> 422.06s]  Freeze is big.
[422.06s -> 423.14s]  What do you think?
[423.14s -> 424.18s]  Freeze or lightning?
[424.18s -> 426.78s]  What do you guys think?
[426.78s -> 431.82s]  Burn, resident sleeper, curse, thumbs up.
[431.82s -> 442.38s]  Lightning, you think so?
[442.38s -> 472.71s]  All right, I gotta stop being an idiot.
[472.71s -> 473.99s]  All right, stop being an idiot.
[473.99s -> 476.76s]  Speed.
[476.76s -> 478.12s]  Pickup range is big.
[478.12s -> 480.66s]  I need movement speed.
[480.66s -> 482.81s]  It's impossible to lose.
[482.81s -> 484.97s]  Well, it's impossible to lose unless I walk into stuff.
[484.97s -> 489.61s]  What just happened?
[490.63s -> 491.35s]  Oh, I selected it.
[491.35s -> 492.71s]  All right, yeah, I want movement speed.
[492.71s -> 493.59s]  So important.
[493.59s -> 508.22s]  Do I get the health now or that?
[511.18s -> 512.14s]  Probably that.
[512.14s -> 542.50s]  Yeah.
[542.50s -> 544.02s]  Yikes.
[544.02s -> 547.66s]  Did I get hit?
[547.66s -> 548.22s]  No, I didn't.
[548.22s -> 549.10s]  I almost did though.
[549.10s -> 551.43s]  All right, summon an egg that will hatch
[551.43s -> 553.91s]  to a dragon in three minutes.
[553.91s -> 556.34s]  Reload rate, 20%.
[556.34s -> 560.06s]  Summon a ghost friend that shoots piercing bullets.
[560.06s -> 561.26s]  Bullet speed plus 30%.
[562.34s -> 563.38s]  Max HP.
[563.38s -> 576.30s]  I need damage.
[576.30s -> 577.18s]  I'm falling off.
[577.18s -> 585.16s]  I'm falling off.
[585.16s -> 586.36s]  I need damage so bad.
[586.36s -> 595.48s]  Summon a magic dagger that seeks out nearby enemies.
[595.48s -> 596.36s]  That's not bad.
[596.36s -> 597.56s]  Probably this though.
[597.56s -> 602.30s]  Every fifth shot, launch a fireball or super speed.
[602.30s -> 604.71s]  Every fifth shot, launch a fireball.
[605.19s -> 606.55s]  I think that's the one.
[606.55s -> 607.86s]  I need damage.
[607.86s -> 611.94s]  Give me something good.
[611.94s -> 615.66s]  Increase fire rate and reload rate by plus 10%
[615.66s -> 617.26s]  permanently every time you get hit.
[619.59s -> 622.20s]  That's good.
[622.20s -> 630.12s]  I don't want to get hit, but I have to.
[630.12s -> 630.84s]  I will.
[630.84s -> 641.22s]  Yeah, I'll be honest.
[641.22s -> 645.54s]  It's kind of hard to tell if the bats are enemies sometimes.
[648.23s -> 649.27s]  Does that count?
[649.27s -> 658.66s]  No, it's probably cursed, right?
[658.66s -> 662.26s]  Got to take the L.
[662.26s -> 663.35s]  Yeah, it's cursed.
[683.32s -> 686.12s]  We got all kinds of variety on a mega gaming weekend.
[686.12s -> 693.37s]  This is a nice break.
[693.37s -> 701.22s]  All right.
[701.22s -> 703.30s]  This is where I could lose everything right here.
[703.30s -> 713.62s]  It's definitely this one.
[713.62s -> 717.10s]  Power shot instead.
[717.10s -> 719.90s]  Bullet damage plus, yeah, fine.
[719.90s -> 720.38s]  I'll do it.
[720.38s -> 720.86s]  You're right.
[720.86s -> 722.46s]  You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[722.46s -> 733.67s]  Stupid, stupid.
[733.67s -> 741.67s]  It's over, it's over, it's over.
[751.56s -> 752.44s]  Oh my God.
[752.44s -> 754.66s]  This thing takes so much damage.
[754.66s -> 755.22s]  I'm sorry.
[755.22s -> 757.54s]  I'm sorry to everybody that voted for me.
[757.54s -> 762.70s]  I could pull it back though.
[762.70s -> 767.90s]  I could pull it back.
[767.90s -> 768.46s]  I can pull it back.
[768.46s -> 769.02s]  I can.
[769.02s -> 772.26s]  You don't understand right angles.
[772.26s -> 779.86s]  One of the mods is saying, hey, is Disney Infinity 3.0
[779.86s -> 780.98s]  actually on the list?
[780.98s -> 782.74s]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[782.82s -> 793.54s]  It is on the list and it's next.
[793.54s -> 799.05s]  Wait, these count as summons.
[799.05s -> 800.49s]  These count as summons, right?
[800.49s -> 801.05s]  I'm doing it.
[801.05s -> 801.77s]  Who cares?
[801.77s -> 807.61s]  That'll kill me, won't it?
[807.61s -> 814.36s]  That reload rate debuff is so bad.
[814.36s -> 821.75s]  This is probably the safe one.
[821.75s -> 838.94s]  I think I may have just saved the whole run.
[838.94s -> 844.58s]  I think I saved the entire run.
[844.58s -> 853.85s]  Run actually may be saved right now if I get giant.
[853.85s -> 854.41s]  Run is safe.
[896.34s -> 909.77s]  I think that's fine.
[909.77s -> 910.90s]  Turn auto aim on.
[910.90s -> 916.63s]  Why would I turn auto aim on?
[916.63s -> 918.31s]  Lightning damage increased by 12.
[918.31s -> 920.31s]  Increased lightning area of effect.
[920.31s -> 921.35s]  It's probably that.
[921.35s -> 923.19s]  Or it's the fast one.
[923.19s -> 925.26s]  I'm going to go fast.
[925.26s -> 931.38s]  Am I actually even moving faster?
[931.38s -> 934.70s]  I don't feel like I'm moving faster.
[934.70s -> 935.88s]  Am I crazy?
[935.88s -> 951.70s]  That one.
[951.70s -> 978.50s]  That one.
[978.50s -> 979.78s]  I'm actually kicking my feet right now.
[979.78s -> 981.14s]  I thought I moved out of the way.
[981.14s -> 1015.00s]  I'm dead.
[1015.00s -> 1015.50s]  Huh?
[1015.96s -> 1017.32s]  One more try.
[1017.32s -> 1017.72s]  One more try.
[1017.72s -> 1018.12s]  I swear to God.
[1018.12s -> 1018.52s]  One more try.
[1018.52s -> 1019.48s]  One more try and that's it.
[1019.48s -> 1020.84s]  One more try.
[1020.84s -> 1021.24s]  One more try.
[1021.24s -> 1022.04s]  One more try.
[1022.04s -> 1023.80s]  I don't like that weapon.
[1023.80s -> 1024.28s]  Last try.
[1024.28s -> 1024.60s]  Last try.
[1024.60s -> 1025.16s]  One more try.
[1025.16s -> 1025.80s]  That's it.
[1025.80s -> 1029.16s]  That weapon, I don't like that weapon.
[1029.96s -> 1032.06s]  I'm going to do grenade launcher.
[1032.06s -> 1046.63s]  What?
[1046.63s -> 1047.27s]  I want to try that.
[1047.27s -> 1048.15s]  That sounds cool.
[1048.15s -> 1049.35s]  With the grenade launcher?
[1051.21s -> 1052.33s]  Grenade launcher is wicked good.
[1052.33s -> 1055.19s]  All right.
[1055.19s -> 1056.23s]  Bullet damage in...
[1056.23s -> 1059.59s]  Okay, probably bullet damage.
[1059.59s -> 1062.87s]  And vision range and pickup range versus...
[1062.87s -> 1068.38s]  How can I put anything in?
[1068.38s -> 1068.86s]  Holy shit.
[1068.86s -> 1069.50s]  That's good.
[1069.50s -> 1080.15s]  How much is this?
[1080.15s -> 1081.67s]  Thirty one fifty.
[1081.67s -> 1094.78s]  Twelve thousand.
[1094.78s -> 1095.02s]  All right.
[1095.02s -> 1095.90s]  Let's try this.
[1095.90s -> 1098.78s]  I got Abby and grenade launcher.
[1098.78s -> 1102.87s]  I'm playing on the hard mode.
[1102.87s -> 1104.71s]  So don't tell me I'm not playing on hard mode.
[1104.71s -> 1107.53s]  That seems kind of good.
[1107.53s -> 1116.22s]  It's impossible to lose this.
[1116.22s -> 1117.98s]  Yeah, this is not possible to lose this, by the way.
[1117.98s -> 1119.74s]  So I would vote for me if I were you.
[1119.74s -> 1141.91s]  I thought I got hit.
[1141.91s -> 1143.35s]  Okay, so what do I want here?
[1143.35s -> 1145.53s]  Bullet damage.
[1145.53s -> 1146.33s]  Definitely that.
[1146.33s -> 1147.61s]  And knockback.
[1147.61s -> 1152.06s]  Bullet speed is pretty good.
[1152.06s -> 1154.22s]  Yeah, I want huge explosions.
[1154.22s -> 1155.50s]  I don't care about the dragon.
[1155.50s -> 1156.50s]  Do the dragon?
[1156.50s -> 1157.06s]  Why?
[1157.06s -> 1160.60s]  I want big explosive bomb stuff.
[1160.60s -> 1164.87s]  Nobody believes in me.
[1164.87s -> 1167.75s]  Get the dragon egg.
[1167.75s -> 1170.95s]  In three minutes a dragon hatch is fine.
[1170.95s -> 1174.23s]  That'll be worth it.
[1174.23s -> 1175.67s]  They said better be worth it.
[1175.67s -> 1190.02s]  Do I still got it?
[1190.02s -> 1191.59s]  Do I still got it?
[1191.59s -> 1197.05s]  Enjoy your stars set on...
[1197.05s -> 1202.58s]  Yes, I do.
[1202.58s -> 1209.99s]  I think it's this.
[1209.99s -> 1212.78s]  I don't have any idea what he says.
[1212.78s -> 1214.78s]  What does the Archmage say in Warcraft 3?
[1214.78s -> 1215.98s]  I don't know what he says.
[1217.22s -> 1222.44s]  In fury for stars set on is all I know.
[1222.44s -> 1223.16s]  What does he actually...
[1223.16s -> 1224.12s]  I have no idea.
[1224.12s -> 1227.38s]  I've never known.
[1227.38s -> 1230.82s]  In fury for stars set on...
[1230.82s -> 1238.20s]  What does he actually say?
[1238.20s -> 1240.79s]  Any you know?
[1240.79s -> 1241.35s]  I don't know, dude.
[1241.35s -> 1242.07s]  Don't ask.
[1242.07s -> 1244.28s]  This is from Warcraft 3.
[1244.28s -> 1249.61s]  It's Latin.
[1249.61s -> 1256.44s]  He says, help me, I'm in a Blizzard game.
[1256.44s -> 1257.40s]  Oh, yeah.
[1257.40s -> 1261.32s]  Help me, I'm in a Blizzard game set on.
[1262.12s -> 1263.32s]  What does he say?
[1263.32s -> 1264.36s]  Do I have to look this up?
[1264.36s -> 1268.94s]  There's a fucking hundred million people here.
[1268.94s -> 1271.74s]  Do I actually have to look up his voice lines?
[1271.74s -> 1279.35s]  Archmage voice lines Warcraft 3.
[1279.35s -> 1281.64s]  What does he say?
[1281.64s -> 1287.56s]  How does nobody know this?
[1287.56s -> 1292.09s]  Perfect.
[1292.09s -> 1297.45s]  Right, right, right.
[1297.45s -> 1302.68s]  Well, perfect.
[1302.68s -> 1303.24s]  Whatever.
[1303.24s -> 1307.45s]  To battle.
[1307.45s -> 1308.17s]  Okay.
[1308.17s -> 1309.45s]  For glory.
[1309.45s -> 1309.77s]  Okay.
[1311.70s -> 1312.18s]  There it is.
[1312.18s -> 1312.66s]  All right.
[1312.66s -> 1314.22s]  The music's too loud.
[1314.22s -> 1314.78s]  Hold on.
[1314.78s -> 1315.34s]  This is important.
[1315.34s -> 1317.48s]  How do I turn the music down?
[1317.48s -> 1320.42s]  How do I turn the music down?
[1320.42s -> 1325.03s]  Okay, here you go.
[1325.03s -> 1326.36s]  This is it right here.
[1330.95s -> 1333.34s]  That's what he says.
[1333.34s -> 1333.98s]  What does he say?
[1345.03s -> 1345.67s]  Whatever.
[1345.67s -> 1354.23s]  Who cares?
[1354.23s -> 1359.90s]  All right, let's go.
[1359.90s -> 1360.70s]  What am I doing?
[1360.70s -> 1362.87s]  I don't think I want that.
[1362.87s -> 1363.43s]  Maybe I do.
[1363.43s -> 1365.48s]  Trained dragon.
[1365.48s -> 1366.92s]  He's speaking Swedish?
[1366.92s -> 1370.46s]  Is that Swedish?
[1370.46s -> 1372.65s]  It's nuts.
[1372.65s -> 1373.78s]  Okay.
[1373.78s -> 1378.84s]  Your dragon gains 10% attack speed every 60 seconds.
[1378.84s -> 1379.16s]  All right.
[1379.16s -> 1380.84s]  So let's do that.
[1380.84s -> 1381.64s]  Even in the egg.
[1381.72s -> 1388.34s]  I can't believe nobody knew that.
[1388.34s -> 1393.08s]  How come all of you...
[1395.00s -> 1405.90s]  How come none of you guys are also like 35 plus year old dorks like me?
[1405.90s -> 1409.74s]  I wonder if it's a rapid fire rate.
[1409.74s -> 1414.22s]  Your dragon gains 8 damage every 60 seconds.
[1414.22s -> 1415.50s]  While in the egg as well.
[1415.50s -> 1417.26s]  Okay, well, we're doing all dragon then.
[1417.26s -> 1435.82s]  All right.
[1435.82s -> 1437.70s]  Dragon again.
[1437.70s -> 1440.90s]  Your bullets deal additional damage equal to 10% of your dragon's damage.
[1440.90s -> 1442.42s]  Well, I mean, we're just doing it.
[1457.62s -> 1458.02s]  Stop.
[1459.27s -> 1459.59s]  Stop!
[1533.88s -> 1535.56s]  Yeah, the auto reload is fucking me up.
[1535.56s -> 1536.20s]  Turn it off.
[1536.20s -> 1540.07s]  It's cutting me off.
[1540.07s -> 1542.76s]  How do you reload?
[1542.76s -> 1552.10s]  All right.
[1552.10s -> 1552.98s]  Come on, man.
[1552.98s -> 1555.06s]  Is it R?
[1555.06s -> 1557.98s]  That's...
[1557.98s -> 1558.30s]  Okay.
[1558.30s -> 1559.26s]  This is huge.
[1559.26s -> 1559.74s]  Yeah.
[1559.74s -> 1560.54s]  Huge bullets.
[1560.54s -> 1569.77s]  Huge damage.
[1569.77s -> 1570.25s]  Yes.
[1570.25s -> 1570.73s]  All right.
[1570.73s -> 1571.61s]  Come on, man.
[1571.61s -> 1583.02s]  I gotta collect.
[1583.02s -> 1583.66s]  Oh my goodness.
[1583.66s -> 1584.30s]  That's right click.
[1584.30s -> 1585.10s]  That's what happens.
[1585.10s -> 1591.78s]  What do we got?
[1591.78s -> 1595.03s]  Double how fast Abby fires during her special.
[1595.03s -> 1595.59s]  Sure.
[1595.59s -> 1604.22s]  Should I take the health or bullet damage and piercing?
[1604.22s -> 1607.85s]  I don't know.
[1607.85s -> 1614.01s]  Why do you not have any pupils?
[1614.01s -> 1621.90s]  Can you see?
[1621.90s -> 1622.38s]  I do.
[1622.38s -> 1623.82s]  It's just the way the lighting is.
[1623.82s -> 1624.22s]  Not a room.
[1624.22s -> 1628.02s]  Come on.
[1628.02s -> 1629.14s]  Maybe it is ghost friend.
[1629.14s -> 1632.20s]  Or should we just do all damage?
[1632.76s -> 1633.56s]  Always.
[1637.08s -> 1638.52s]  They pierce killed enemies.
[1638.52s -> 1644.71s]  Maybe I'll be safe.
[1644.71s -> 1645.67s]  Yeah, I'll be safe.
[1645.67s -> 1647.21s]  I have plenty of damage right now.
[1647.21s -> 1659.58s]  I have to wrap around and go in the middle there.
[1659.58s -> 1659.90s]  All right.
[1659.90s -> 1660.54s]  Dragons here.
[1660.54s -> 1661.18s]  Finally.
[1661.18s -> 1663.35s]  What's the dragon doing for damage?
[1663.35s -> 1664.76s]  Forty...
[1664.76s -> 1665.88s]  That's actually really good.
[1665.88s -> 1681.08s]  Bullet speed.
[1681.08s -> 1682.52s]  That's huge because...
[1682.52s -> 1682.76s]  Yeah.
[1682.76s -> 1683.48s]  I think it's that.
[1683.48s -> 1685.16s]  It's either that or it's...
[1685.16s -> 1687.42s]  I don't know.
[1687.42s -> 1688.06s]  Haste.
[1688.06s -> 1696.98s]  I don't have any move speed.
[1696.98s -> 1697.70s]  It has to be this.
[1697.70s -> 1698.02s]  Yeah.
[1698.02s -> 1704.58s]  There's nothing else it would be.
[1704.58s -> 1705.86s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1705.86s -> 1706.58s]  Bad idea.
[1706.58s -> 1707.22s]  Bad idea.
[1707.22s -> 1707.78s]  Bad idea.
[1707.78s -> 1708.34s]  Bad idea.
[1708.34s -> 1708.90s]  Bad idea.
[1708.90s -> 1709.62s]  Very bad idea.
[1709.62s -> 1712.20s]  These hurt me.
[1712.20s -> 1713.72s]  That was a terrible idea.
[1713.72s -> 1715.03s]  Whose idea was that?
[1718.30s -> 1719.02s]  It runs over.
[1719.02s -> 1719.82s]  It runs over.
[1719.82s -> 1745.59s]  I didn't know that it was...
[1745.59s -> 1747.72s]  I didn't know that that was going to do that.
[1747.72s -> 1749.80s]  I thought it was going to explode into just little pellets,
[1749.80s -> 1751.48s]  not into other bombs that...
[1751.48s -> 1754.46s]  This is the last try.
[1754.46s -> 1757.50s]  And then we're going to play Disney Infinity 3.0.
[1757.50s -> 1764.28s]  I actually like this weapon, but now that I...
[1764.28s -> 1764.52s]  All right.
[1764.52s -> 1765.00s]  Let's go.
[1765.00s -> 1765.32s]  Come on.
[1765.32s -> 1768.22s]  I'm going both headphones for this, by the way.
[1768.22s -> 1790.07s]  We'll do the same thing.
[1790.07s -> 1790.79s]  Dragon egg.
[1790.79s -> 1792.84s]  It's really early.
[1792.84s -> 1811.85s]  Dragon.
[1811.85s -> 1814.18s]  Eight more damage every 60 seconds.
[1814.18s -> 1815.30s]  It's super early.
[1815.30s -> 1837.11s]  Dragon again.
[1837.11s -> 1838.07s]  Super early.
[1838.07s -> 1855.53s]  That's really dangerous with this character.
[1855.53s -> 1865.19s]  Oh my goodness.
[1865.19s -> 1899.37s]  I don't...
[1899.37s -> 1901.69s]  That move is not something I should be doing ever.
[1901.69s -> 1904.50s]  Unless it's an absolutely desperate scenario.
[1904.50s -> 1915.10s]  10% attack speed.
[1915.10s -> 1915.74s]  Yes.
[1915.74s -> 1919.69s]  When this dragon hatches, it's going to be better.
[1919.69s -> 1925.08s]  I need blast radius or something, right?
[1925.08s -> 1956.06s]  Collect.
[1964.26s -> 1967.27s]  Double.
[1967.27s -> 1967.91s]  Yeah.
[1967.91s -> 1984.12s]  Wrap around.
[1984.12s -> 1995.70s]  I need that shit.
[1995.70s -> 1996.02s]  All right.
[1996.02s -> 1997.94s]  I'm a little more confident than I just was.
[1997.94s -> 2003.27s]  I am way more confident now.
[2003.27s -> 2005.62s]  Surprises of face cam?
[2005.62s -> 2007.08s]  I started doing face cam every case.
[2007.08s -> 2009.56s]  So I played Elden Ring for a month straight with a face cam on,
[2009.56s -> 2010.76s]  and then I just never turned it off.
[2010.76s -> 2013.82s]  After not doing face cam for like almost 10 years.
[2013.82s -> 2015.66s]  Very rarely if I did a horror game or something.
[2015.66s -> 2019.27s]  Yeah.
[2019.27s -> 2024.14s]  Big shot.
[2024.14s -> 2034.01s]  That's much better.
[2034.01s -> 2034.41s]  All right.
[2034.41s -> 2034.97s]  There we go.
[2034.97s -> 2035.61s]  Let's go.
[2035.61s -> 2052.06s]  Give us the chest.
[2052.06s -> 2055.42s]  Move speed and reload rate by 35% for two seconds after reloading.
[2055.42s -> 2056.06s]  Pretty good.
[2056.06s -> 2056.54s]  Wait.
[2056.54s -> 2064.97s]  That's not good.
[2064.97s -> 2065.85s]  That's not good.
[2065.85s -> 2068.25s]  Because that is going to come out of nowhere,
[2068.25s -> 2070.55s]  and I'm going to run into something.
[2070.55s -> 2071.43s]  It is good.
[2071.43s -> 2075.35s]  But I'm used to moving at a certain, you know, knots per second, whatever.
[2075.91s -> 2078.71s]  And if I just speed up randomly after killing,
[2078.71s -> 2080.15s]  I'm going to hit something.
[2080.15s -> 2083.38s]  For two seconds?
[2083.38s -> 2083.86s]  OK.
[2083.86s -> 2086.26s]  After reloading, I'm going to be going like this.
[2086.26s -> 2088.28s]  I'm going to reload, and then I'm going to stop.
[2089.24s -> 2091.06s]  I don't want to adapt.
[2091.06s -> 2092.82s]  I already know how the character moves.
[2092.82s -> 2097.67s]  This fell on the ground, and I'm going to do this.
[2097.67s -> 2116.57s]  Now it's new.
[2116.57s -> 2117.37s]  Eww.
[2117.37s -> 2130.18s]  This boomer is incapable of adapting.
[2130.18s -> 2132.50s]  If I kill all the people that are telling me to take this, then fine.
[2132.50s -> 2136.62s]  When I die, you go, wow, I can't believe I trusted him.
[2136.62s -> 2137.18s]  Then you'll see.
[2143.50s -> 2147.00s]  No, it's not this.
[2147.00s -> 2147.48s]  No, it is.
[2147.48s -> 2149.00s]  It is.
[2149.00s -> 2149.64s]  No, it's this.
[2149.64s -> 2150.92s]  It's Holy Shield for sure.
[2150.92s -> 2152.12s]  Just eat a free damage.
[2152.12s -> 2152.94s]  Yeah.
[2152.94s -> 2154.42s]  It's that.
[2154.42s -> 2165.88s]  Let's go.
[2165.88s -> 2167.24s]  I have so much damage.
[2167.24s -> 2171.06s]  It's just a question of when I'm going to end up killing myself,
[2171.06s -> 2173.14s]  like accidentally with the explosion.
[2173.14s -> 2196.73s]  You can do that.
[2196.73s -> 2198.09s]  Dragon is sick, by the way.
[2198.09s -> 2198.41s]  All right.
[2198.41s -> 2200.38s]  Come on.
[2200.38s -> 2201.98s]  Reload rate, 20%.
[2201.98s -> 2204.65s]  That's very good.
[2204.65s -> 2205.37s]  We want that.
[2205.37s -> 2230.01s]  Look at how fast I am.
[2230.01s -> 2231.53s]  Boss is incoming here in a minute.
[2231.53s -> 2244.57s]  10%.
[2244.57s -> 2247.66s]  Ooh, that's good too.
[2247.66s -> 2252.04s]  I think it's this, the ammo and the reload rate.
[2252.04s -> 2263.91s]  All right, here we go.
[2263.91s -> 2280.71s]  Don't blow it.
[2280.71s -> 2282.78s]  Yeah.
[2282.78s -> 2283.34s]  OK.
[2283.34s -> 2285.93s]  Something in my teeth.
[2285.93s -> 2290.92s]  Bullet bounce.
[2291.90s -> 2292.86s]  Oh, boy.
[2299.32s -> 2300.20s]  Is this bad?
[2300.20s -> 2313.08s]  I have the dragon.
[2313.08s -> 2314.76s]  The dragon is doing 40 damage.
[2314.76s -> 2319.30s]  So do I want the dragon to be doing what?
[2319.30s -> 2322.12s]  Like 60 to 70 damage?
[2322.12s -> 2325.56s]  And me be able to shoot and supplement the dragon?
[2330.55s -> 2333.03s]  This is going to bounce off people and come back, explode, and kill me.
[2333.03s -> 2333.91s]  We're not doing that.
[2333.91s -> 2339.21s]  This is awful.
[2339.21s -> 2340.09s]  These are all bad.
[2340.09s -> 2346.57s]  Triple your base max ammo, but 50% less damage.
[2346.57s -> 2348.89s]  I'm not taking it.
[2348.89s -> 2353.11s]  It's not happening.
[2353.11s -> 2379.67s]  Wait, I didn't take it.
[2379.67s -> 2380.63s]  No, I'm not taking it.
[2380.63s -> 2388.15s]  It's a bad idea.
[2388.15s -> 2392.89s]  Curse?
[2392.89s -> 2395.77s]  Health was going to be the second thing I was going to do.
[2395.77s -> 2413.78s]  I want this box to go away, please.
[2413.78s -> 2441.06s]  I...
[2441.06s -> 2441.62s]  Whatever.
[2441.62s -> 2468.71s]  See, I knew that was going to happen.
[2468.71s -> 2471.74s]  I was going to get too close to the explosion.
[2500.89s -> 2504.73s]  You need to start pretending.
[2504.73s -> 2505.61s]  Start pretending what?
[2505.61s -> 2509.40s]  Pretend what?
[2509.40s -> 2521.22s]  Fresh clip first one.
[2521.22s -> 2522.18s]  That's actually a really...
[2522.18s -> 2522.82s]  Yeah, that's a good choice.
[2522.82s -> 2534.60s]  You're right.
[2534.60s -> 2535.72s]  What the fuck?
[2535.72s -> 2536.76s]  Oh, it was...
[2536.76s -> 2537.48s]  Whatever.
[2537.48s -> 2538.36s]  OK, come on.
[2538.36s -> 2557.77s]  Don't lose it now.
[2557.77s -> 2559.13s]  They're so fast.
[2559.13s -> 2588.39s]  As much as you're...
[2588.39s -> 2589.83s]  This is going to do 100 something damage.
[2589.83s -> 2612.36s]  This is going to be huge.
[2612.36s -> 2627.75s]  Oh, I think I want to do pick up range at this point.
[2627.75s -> 2630.78s]  Curse is good, but I need to level.
[2630.78s -> 2631.50s]  I have to.
[2631.50s -> 2632.79s]  I have to level up.
[2632.79s -> 2634.23s]  I need to be able to pick stuff up.
[2634.23s -> 2651.26s]  Am I invincible during that?
[2651.26s -> 2652.84s]  I feel like I just was.
[2652.84s -> 2659.19s]  Can somebody confirm?
[2659.19s -> 2662.81s]  Fuck, I'm losing it.
[2662.81s -> 2663.93s]  It's the piercing.
[2663.93s -> 2665.38s]  The piercing is fucking me up.
[2665.38s -> 2669.59s]  The piercing is fucking me up because I'm shooting...
[2669.59s -> 2671.67s]  I'm expecting it to blow up on somebody,
[2671.67s -> 2673.43s]  but it goes through them and blows up after them.
[2673.43s -> 2674.39s]  That was a mistake.
[2674.39s -> 2677.02s]  Sorry, all the believers.
[2677.02s -> 2677.98s]  This might be a problem.
[2677.98s -> 2682.95s]  This might be a problem.
[2682.95s -> 2706.23s]  See what I mean?
[2706.23s -> 2706.87s]  See what I mean?
[2706.87s -> 2707.27s]  I just...
[2707.27s -> 2708.87s]  It's nothing I can do about it.
[2708.87s -> 2710.87s]  It's going through people and I can't walk forward
[2710.87s -> 2712.95s]  because if I walk forward and I shoot somebody,
[2712.95s -> 2715.61s]  I'm going to get hit by the explosion.
[2715.61s -> 2716.49s]  I fucked it up.
[2716.49s -> 2721.99s]  It's all right.
[2721.99s -> 2723.75s]  It's all right.
[2723.75s -> 2724.31s]  All right.
[2724.31s -> 2724.81s]  All right.
[2728.63s -> 2789.66s]  How much does this cost?
[2805.21s -> 2805.77s]  This game's fun.
[2805.77s -> 2806.81s]  All right, goodbye.
[2806.81s -> 2807.53s]  All right, we're moving on.
[2807.53s -> 2808.17s]  Moving on, moving on.
[2808.17s -> 2809.13s]  All right, all right, all right, right.
[2809.13s -> 2813.45s]  Moving on, moving on, moving on.
[2813.45s -> 2824.20s]  That was so much fun.
[2824.20s -> 2829.46s]  Okay, so...
[2833.19s -> 2834.47s]  You know what I'm going to do?
[2834.47s -> 2836.31s]  I'm going to take a nice cold shower.
[2836.31s -> 2838.36s]  I'm not cold, you know, like lukewarm.
[2838.36s -> 2840.74s]  It's going to be great.
[2840.74s -> 2843.08s]  I did, in that big break,
[2843.08s -> 2846.92s]  I did a witch hazel wipe,
[2846.92s -> 2851.21s]  freshening me up a bit.
[2851.21s -> 2858.94s]  All good.
[2858.94s -> 2862.15s]  Skincare stream.
[2868.71s -> 2869.59s]  Peep the elbow.
[2873.74s -> 2874.62s]  It's fine.
[2874.62s -> 2877.18s]  It's just because sitting here
[2877.18s -> 2878.46s]  with my elbows on it for a while.
[2879.82s -> 2880.78s]  5 a.m. Eastern.
[2881.34s -> 2884.26s]  We're getting close.
[2884.26s -> 2884.66s]  Okay, let me...
[2885.86s -> 2896.25s]  All right, I hope this is not too intense.
[2896.25s -> 2908.04s]  We'll find out.
[2908.04s -> 2909.48s]  Because of the camera saturation
[2909.48s -> 2910.92s]  that it looks like that, probably.
[2910.92s -> 2912.66s]  Let me see.
[2916.49s -> 2920.15s]  Yeah, it's just, there's a lot of effects
[2920.15s -> 2921.67s]  on this right now because we put them on
[2921.67s -> 2923.51s]  to try to make the camera look better.
[2924.15s -> 2929.62s]  Twitch tracker says the longest stream
[2929.62s -> 2931.54s]  was 13 hours and five minutes.
[2931.54s -> 2935.93s]  Can somebody go confirm to make sure
[2935.93s -> 2936.65s]  that that's the case?
[2938.60s -> 2939.48s]  Let me just bow.
[2942.39s -> 2944.63s]  I get to 13 hours and five minutes
[2944.63s -> 2946.15s]  and then I'm like, hooray, let's turn it off.
[2946.15s -> 2947.51s]  And it was actually like 13 hours
[2947.51s -> 2949.19s]  and like 10 minutes.
[2949.19s -> 2959.10s]  14 hours just to be safe.
[2959.10s -> 2965.22s]  Well, I will go combine the fellowship
[2965.22s -> 2965.86s]  in two towers.
[2966.98s -> 2969.93s]  Yeah, I'm good for it.
[2969.93s -> 2970.41s]  I'm okay.
[2970.97s -> 2972.25s]  I still got this.
[2972.25s -> 2973.53s]  I drank this whole thing.
[2973.53s -> 2982.46s]  So I'm going to do high HP and the bow.
[2982.46s -> 2982.94s]  Maybe not.
[2983.02s -> 2984.46s]  What's the one I haven't played with?
[2985.02s -> 2986.39s]  Dual SMGs.
[2989.54s -> 2991.78s]  Upgrades apply separately to each gun.
[2992.71s -> 2993.59s]  That's interesting.
[2998.17s -> 2998.81s]  These good.
[2998.81s -> 3004.95s]  I feel like I could have gotten this
[3004.95s -> 3005.59s]  to work really well.
[3005.59s -> 3006.47s]  Let me try the bow.
[3006.47s -> 3012.73s]  Let me see if I can make this work.
[3013.29s -> 3019.29s]  When I reload, they come back.
[3019.29s -> 3024.58s]  So you want insane reload speed then.
[3024.58s -> 3027.46s]  You want reload speed, ammo, and piercing.
[3030.97s -> 3032.17s]  I walked into the tree.
[3033.86s -> 3036.34s]  Forgot that the tree was evil.
[3036.34s -> 3063.66s]  Oh my God, you're gambling on this?
[3063.66s -> 3065.34s]  I don't know if that's a good idea.
[3068.39s -> 3072.81s]  These all aren't that great for this.
[3073.45s -> 3075.72s]  Vision range?
[3075.72s -> 3083.50s]  I don't know, maybe.
[3083.50s -> 3084.78s]  I feel like that's safe.
[3084.78s -> 3102.65s]  Fall in, I believe.
[3103.86s -> 3104.98s]  Well, I appreciate it.
[3104.98s -> 3119.48s]  Yeah, I need way more reload than that.
[3119.48s -> 3125.30s]  Reload speed.
[3125.30s -> 3126.34s]  Fire rate, that would be good.
[3130.09s -> 3131.05s]  It's the fire rate.
[3131.05s -> 3144.23s]  I thought I got out of that.
[3144.23s -> 3150.42s]  Okay, bullet damage and knockback
[3150.42s -> 3153.26s]  or more projectiles.
[3153.26s -> 3154.94s]  Probably that because of the pullback.
[3154.94s -> 3162.34s]  Why do all these people have ones and twos on them?
[3162.34s -> 3162.90s]  One, two.
[3162.90s -> 3164.50s]  What's with the one and the two?
[3164.50s -> 3195.06s]  He doesn't know.
[3195.62s -> 3196.34s]  I don't know.
[3196.34s -> 3199.90s]  Oh, it's the prediction choices.
[3199.90s -> 3200.40s]  Okay.
[3201.04s -> 3203.93s]  So you're going to be kind of in little groups
[3203.93s -> 3206.64s]  of one, two, three, or four, huh?
[3206.64s -> 3208.81s]  Very interesting.
[3208.81s -> 3219.52s]  Ghost friend?
[3219.52s -> 3220.72s]  Just one or two?
[3220.72s -> 3223.47s]  Predicted yet?
[3223.47s -> 3224.43s]  Oh, I thought it was...
[3224.43s -> 3225.71s]  Oh, no, it's not a pull.
[3225.71s -> 3227.93s]  Wait, can't you do more than...
[3227.93s -> 3229.05s]  Oh, no, I thought it...
[3229.05s -> 3230.73s]  Okay, I thought it was a pull for a second.
[3230.73s -> 3233.00s]  That's been 13 hours.
[3233.00s -> 3242.14s]  I'm good.
[3242.14s -> 3245.12s]  Don't worry about me, I'm fine.
[3245.12s -> 3248.62s]  I'm fine, I'll be okay.
[3248.62s -> 3251.02s]  I really thought that there was four options.
[3251.02s -> 3259.52s]  Great, did he predict yes or no?
[3259.52s -> 3261.52s]  How about yes two and no two?
[3261.52s -> 3266.67s]  There's no way he's going to beat this
[3266.67s -> 3269.79s]  with the least amount of brain cells.
[3269.79s -> 3273.26s]  You know what's crazy?
[3273.26s -> 3275.98s]  I think that that would make it easier
[3275.98s -> 3278.57s]  because I'm not sitting here going like,
[3278.57s -> 3279.85s]  oh my God, I have to watch out.
[3279.85s -> 3280.97s]  Wake up with those bad guys.
[3280.97s -> 3281.85s]  How much health do I have?
[3281.85s -> 3283.69s]  No, I'm just kind of like just sitting here.
[3284.73s -> 3289.28s]  So I don't know, you may have picked wrong defense.
[3290.17s -> 3291.05s]  Even the boss comes out.
[3291.61s -> 3294.84s]  That's better.
[3299.92s -> 3302.00s]  Yeah, it's that fire rate and ammo.
[3302.00s -> 3314.20s]  I would love more projectiles.
[3314.20s -> 3324.46s]  Bullet bounce, bullet speed.
[3324.46s -> 3325.02s]  That's okay.
[3325.74s -> 3326.78s]  Dark Arts is pretty good.
[3329.29s -> 3332.56s]  Probably the fire rate.
[3332.56s -> 3334.88s]  10% is bad though.
[3334.88s -> 3336.64s]  I'll do Dark Arts.
[3336.64s -> 3345.23s]  You know what's insane?
[3345.23s -> 3350.09s]  I beat the ultra kill act two campaign seven hours ago.
[3350.65s -> 3351.45s]  I forgot I did that.
[3352.25s -> 3355.77s]  It's absolutely been an omega gaming weekend.
[3356.89s -> 3357.13s]  Day.
[3358.33s -> 3359.88s]  Friday.
[3359.88s -> 3364.08s]  Fish game.
[3365.12s -> 3367.48s]  Oh yeah, that game was fun.
[3368.28s -> 3379.21s]  I genuinely enjoyed that game.
[3379.21s -> 3380.09s]  Oh boy.
[3380.09s -> 3390.16s]  Fire rate and really, I hate this one.
[3391.08s -> 3392.52s]  But I mean, why not take it?
[3393.32s -> 3399.20s]  It's kind of good.
[3402.25s -> 3409.13s]  Yeah, well, I'll take the,
[3410.73s -> 3418.99s]  remember when I ate the French bread pizza?
[3418.99s -> 3419.55s]  It was great.
[3426.56s -> 3427.36s]  In case you forgot.
[3432.41s -> 3435.56s]  Oh my God, are you serious?
[3435.56s -> 3438.60s]  Oh, guys, there's still a piece left.
[3438.60s -> 3439.80s]  I still have a half a piece left.
[3444.36s -> 3445.96s]  Oh my, so good.
[3448.51s -> 3467.04s]  I'm hitting E instead of W.
[3467.04s -> 3493.63s]  Collect.
[3493.63s -> 3509.69s]  These all kind of suck.
[3509.69s -> 3511.15s]  Well, for what I'm doing.
[3511.15s -> 3522.86s]  This character is really cool though.
[3522.86s -> 3523.90s]  I like the mechanic.
[3523.90s -> 3535.18s]  This is the moment of truth here.
[3535.18s -> 3554.78s]  Oh, he's still alive.
[3554.78s -> 3555.50s]  Holy shit.
[3557.79s -> 3558.51s]  Shield.
[3558.51s -> 3572.30s]  All right.
[3572.30s -> 3573.02s]  Movement speed.
[3573.66s -> 3574.22s]  Big.
[3574.22s -> 3577.45s]  Bullet damage, bullet size and piercing.
[3577.45s -> 3582.14s]  Big.
[3582.14s -> 3582.78s]  It's that.
[3582.78s -> 3587.21s]  Fire rate, but still the damage is crazy.
[3587.21s -> 3588.12s]  I was here.
[3588.12s -> 3591.10s]  Wait, did I do it?
[3591.10s -> 3596.94s]  Is this officially the longest stream I've ever done?
[3596.94s -> 3597.74s]  All right.
[3597.74s -> 3603.36s]  Cool.
[3603.36s -> 3605.44s]  13 hours and five minutes.
[3605.44s -> 3610.68s]  And I didn't drop a single frame unless I downloaded the game.
[3610.68s -> 3618.43s]  You know what's really funny?
[3619.37s -> 3622.86s]  Okay, so when was that Lord of the Rings stream?
[3622.86s -> 3625.95s]  2017?
[3625.95s -> 3626.83s]  2018?
[3626.83s -> 3636.73s]  2019?
[3636.73s -> 3639.32s]  Four years ago.
[3639.32s -> 3642.16s]  I think I'm on record saying after.
[3642.16s -> 3647.74s]  When I took that big break when I was gone for like three months,
[3647.74s -> 3649.90s]  it was on January 11, 2020.
[3649.90s -> 3651.64s]  Okay, so this hasn't been that long,
[3651.64s -> 3654.68s]  but I think when I came back from the long break,
[3654.68s -> 3655.80s]  like four months,
[3655.80s -> 3660.43s]  I think I said I will never ever do a stream
[3660.43s -> 3673.04s]  that's longer than 12 hours ever again.
[3673.04s -> 3677.85s]  I guess not.
[3677.85s -> 3678.49s]  So what now?
[3678.49s -> 3682.24s]  For every second I'm setting the tone for,
[3682.24s -> 3684.40s]  it's got to be a number that I want, right?
[3684.40s -> 3685.52s]  It's got to be a number that I like.
[3690.67s -> 3692.35s]  I don't like 13, though.
[3692.35s -> 3699.15s]  13?
[3699.15s -> 3700.51s]  13 is an odd number.
[3709.56s -> 3710.94s]  It's not that much longer.
[3710.94s -> 3713.96s]  Okay, how about 13?
[3713.96s -> 3717.74s]  Wait, dude, what if I do?
[3717.74s -> 3718.78s]  Oh, watch this shit.
[3718.78s -> 3719.82s]  Everyone's going to hate me for this.
[3719.82s -> 3722.84s]  1337 is so dumb.
[3722.84s -> 3725.44s]  Absolute worst number.
[3725.44s -> 3729.61s]  It's funny because I could do that and that would be it forever.
[3729.61s -> 3733.00s]  133737.
[3733.00s -> 3735.48s]  But 133700, it's so bad.
[3735.48s -> 3743.07s]  But I think actually I might be mad that I did that.
[3743.07s -> 3745.47s]  Months or years later, I might be like, really?
[3745.47s -> 3749.90s]  That's what I decided to do.
[3749.90s -> 3757.79s]  123456 would have been so perfect,
[3757.79s -> 3762.43s]  but it's too bad 12 hours was 12 hours and 56 minutes,
[3762.43s -> 3765.96s]  but 12 hours and 45 minutes, whatever.
[3765.96s -> 3769.36s]  I would have loved 123456.
[3769.36s -> 3791.90s]  Let's go.
[3791.90s -> 3792.86s]  Oh, that's cool.
[3792.86s -> 3794.78s]  I really didn't think I was ever going to do this ever again.
[3794.78s -> 3808.03s]  And like I said, I know that a 13 hour stream is really not.
[3808.03s -> 3809.47s]  Wow. Oh my God.
[3809.47s -> 3813.68s]  I'm one of the only streamers ever to do a 13.
[3813.68s -> 3816.00s]  I know people do this regularly all the time.
[3816.00s -> 3823.69s]  Oh, man.
[3823.69s -> 3827.61s]  I'm not even sure I would be able to do more than 14, 13 or 14 hours.
[3827.61s -> 3828.97s]  Back when I was like 20.
[3829.69s -> 3830.35s]  I don't know.
[3830.35s -> 3831.15s]  I don't know how people do it.
[3831.95s -> 3835.40s]  Because you know what it is?
[3835.40s -> 3840.91s]  It's not just the fact that you're, whatever, 13 hours.
[3841.55s -> 3844.35s]  There are a lot of people that work 13 hour days,
[3844.35s -> 3845.79s]  12 hour days, 10 hour shifts.
[3846.35s -> 3846.59s]  Right.
[3848.19s -> 3848.83s]  It's a lot.
[3849.87s -> 3853.16s]  I think the major difference with like a stream is
[3854.44s -> 3856.20s]  I've been kind of sitting in the same spot.
[3858.76s -> 3860.36s]  I've gone to the bathroom once or twice
[3860.92s -> 3864.12s]  and I've eaten pizza at the desk for like 14 hours.
[3865.08s -> 3867.40s]  So it's like it's like the low amount of movement
[3868.04s -> 3872.22s]  is I think like the killer and like the visual stimulation.
[3876.09s -> 3878.97s]  But yeah, let me be very, very, very clear.
[3879.61s -> 3882.81s]  The reason why I don't do 10 plus hour streams
[3882.81s -> 3885.77s]  is because I don't want to, right?
[3889.16s -> 3890.52s]  Get up once in a while and do stretches.
[3891.16s -> 3897.88s]  Yeah, you do a lot of content for 14 hours.
[3899.68s -> 3907.40s]  Um, I mean, it's for me, it's not.
[3907.40s -> 3908.12s]  Maybe I don't know.
[3908.12s -> 3909.72s]  I'm trying to think of a way that I could word it.
[3910.76s -> 3915.92s]  I think I expel a lot of energy on the stream.
[3917.16s -> 3917.56s]  A lot.
[3918.12s -> 3921.04s]  It's the end.
[3924.36s -> 3926.52s]  I think it's just the kind of the way that I am.
[3927.56s -> 3939.04s]  But yeah, it's not, uh, I'm not trying to say that like,
[3939.04s -> 3941.84s]  oh my gosh, guys, streaming is so hard.
[3943.26s -> 3944.94s]  No, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[3944.94s -> 3953.84s]  You know, would you ever do a 24 hour?
[3953.84s -> 3955.20s]  No, not in a million years.
[3955.84s -> 3958.44s]  Not in a hundred million years.
[3958.44s -> 3960.51s]  Oh my God.
[3960.51s -> 3961.55s]  Don't, I'm dead.
[3961.55s -> 3964.14s]  I looked at that at the end.
[3964.14s -> 3978.54s]  What about a thousand million years?
[3981.21s -> 3983.21s]  Yeah, it's just like my body and brain just can't
[3983.85s -> 3986.62s]  do that for more than like 10 to 12 hours usually.
[3986.62s -> 3988.38s]  After hour number five or six is when I'm kind of like,
[3988.38s -> 3989.92s]  yeah, I'm done.
[3989.92s -> 3991.60s]  But look, more power to you.
[3991.60s -> 3995.60s]  If you can really do that for more than 12, 13, 14 hours all the time.
[3995.60s -> 4002.46s]  Although I would say that, um, it's probably not that healthy to do this that often.
[4002.46s -> 4007.16s]  Um, another, one of the reasons why I don't really do this that often is because I,
[4007.16s -> 4012.30s]  I have a lot of health problems and I could really probably fuck myself up if I did too much.
[4013.29s -> 4014.81s]  13, 13 is coming up.
[4014.81s -> 4016.81s]  That's kind of interesting.
[4016.81s -> 4018.97s]  13, 13, 13.
[4018.97s -> 4022.62s]  Nah, no, no, no.
[4022.62s -> 4024.84s]  You can burn out.
[4024.84s -> 4025.96s]  Yeah, I don't want to burn out either.
[4025.96s -> 4026.60s]  That's another thing too.
[4026.60s -> 4030.51s]  I don't, I really don't want to burn out.
[4030.51s -> 4031.47s]  Kind of interesting.
[4031.47s -> 4042.70s]  I think you, you can, when you go through all your oil and there's not much left,
[4042.70s -> 4046.76s]  it's, um, it's really long-term.
[4046.76s -> 4047.56s]  It's really not great for you.
[4047.56s -> 4050.14s]  It's really not a good thing.
[4050.14s -> 4051.02s]  Is he sleepy?
[4051.02s -> 4051.90s]  I'm kind of sleepy.
[4054.51s -> 4059.45s]  13, 13, 13, 13.
[4059.45s -> 4063.26s]  No, no, let's wind down.
[4063.26s -> 4064.38s]  It ends when it ends.
[4064.38s -> 4069.98s]  This game is really fun though, too.
[4069.98s -> 4076.81s]  20 minutes till dawn.
[4076.81s -> 4086.96s]  Um, let me see here.
[4086.96s -> 4087.60s]  Let me see.
[4087.60s -> 4090.40s]  How was I at the end of that two towers, Vaude?
[4090.40s -> 4100.30s]  Wait, how come Lord of the Rings of Two Towers is nine hours and 40 minutes?
[4103.02s -> 4104.30s]  How come this is shorter?
[4104.30s -> 4113.79s]  It was two Vaudes.
[4113.79s -> 4115.47s]  Oh, it's split up by the game.
[4115.47s -> 4115.95s]  Okay.
[4115.95s -> 4126.96s]  It's a 12-hour limit.
[4126.96s -> 4127.84s]  Oh, right.
[4127.84s -> 4129.92s]  Okay.
[4129.92s -> 4131.84s]  Yeah, so that's going to be the end of the stream.
[4131.84s -> 4133.84s]  I'll see you guys later.
[4133.84s -> 4137.74s]  I don't, uh, Omega Weekend sort of turned into, uh,
[4137.74s -> 4140.38s]  beat my old longest stream ever record.
[4140.38s -> 4144.91s]  I guess, I guess they are one and the same,
[4144.91s -> 4150.06s]  but I do still have a dozen and a half more games to play.
[4150.06s -> 4160.54s]  So these don't have to go away.
[4160.54s -> 4161.50s]  Keep an eye on the sus.
[4162.62s -> 4166.14s]  Uh, if it's Sunday or Monday, maybe it'll be Sunday.
[4166.14s -> 4167.58s]  It's definitely not going to be tomorrow.
[4167.58s -> 4168.54s]  Or today.
[4168.54s -> 4168.94s]  What is it?
[4168.94s -> 4170.70s]  Like 6 a.m. for a lot of you guys.
[4170.70s -> 4171.88s]  10 a.m.
[4171.88s -> 4172.76s]  Saturday.
[4172.76s -> 4179.02s]  I'll play Splatoon 3 and I'll play, I won't do a Switch night.
[4179.02s -> 4185.36s]  Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 3, some other things that are on Switch.
[4185.36s -> 4187.76s]  Or maybe I'll just play Breath of the Wild.
[4188.56s -> 4190.00s]  It's time to play it, right?
[4190.00s -> 4192.48s]  Should I just do it?
[4192.48s -> 4192.96s]  I don't know.
[4192.96s -> 4199.28s]  Is it time to just do it at some point in the next week?
[4199.28s -> 4209.04s]  Next few days?
[4209.04s -> 4210.43s]  Yes.
[4210.43s -> 4210.75s]  Okay.
[4214.52s -> 4216.44s]  Please stream.
[4216.44s -> 4217.48s]  What did you say?
[4217.48s -> 4221.52s]  Please stream on the weekends for us working Andes.
[4221.52s -> 4223.20s]  I like streaming on the weekends.
[4229.05s -> 4230.89s]  Breath of the Wild is a perfect game for you.
[4230.89s -> 4235.82s]  Put sus for Saturday or Sunday?
[4235.82s -> 4238.46s]  I would put sus for Sunday.
[4239.66s -> 4241.42s]  Sunday slash Monday.
[4241.42s -> 4249.39s]  Gears of War is on Switch?
[4253.58s -> 4254.70s]  Omega Weekend.
[4257.28s -> 4257.92s]  So Monday.
[4259.63s -> 4260.83s]  I don't know.
[4260.83s -> 4261.47s]  Who knows?
[4261.47s -> 4262.43s]  I might just show up.
[4262.43s -> 4263.15s]  Just go.
[4267.20s -> 4271.36s]  Can I trade you Omega Weekend for Omega Record Stream Breaker?
[4271.36s -> 4276.43s]  We'll see.
[4276.43s -> 4277.23s]  I don't know.
[4277.23s -> 4282.81s]  It's very possible that tomorrow or Sunday, I'm just like, whatever, let's go.
[4282.81s -> 4283.05s]  No.
[4293.82s -> 4295.02s]  Oath Breaker.
[4295.02s -> 4297.10s]  That's not what we agreed to, Elbertson.
[4297.10s -> 4301.84s]  We didn't agree to this.
[4301.84s -> 4306.24s]  I'll be back in here tomorrow afternoon to increase or offline chat.
[4306.24s -> 4307.20s]  We'll figure it out.
[4307.20s -> 4318.32s]  What about a Twitch moment badge for longest stream?
[4318.32s -> 4320.94s]  Wait, can I do that?
[4320.94s -> 4322.22s]  Wait, hold on.
[4322.22s -> 4323.26s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4323.26s -> 4324.54s]  Is that, can I do that?
[4325.76s -> 4327.52s]  How do I do that?
[4327.52s -> 4332.57s]  Can I actually do that right now?
[4332.57s -> 4333.29s]  Yeah.
[4333.29s -> 4334.33s]  Wait, how?
[4334.33s -> 4345.82s]  Does anybody know?
[4345.82s -> 4349.21s]  Do slash moment.
[4349.21s -> 4350.89s]  Slash moment.
[4350.89s -> 4357.16s]  Clip moments on stream and recognize viewers that were there with a commemorative badge.
[4357.16s -> 4357.80s]  Oh, okay.
[4357.80s -> 4363.96s]  So hold on.
[4363.96s -> 4364.84s]  Like right now?
[4364.84s -> 4365.40s]  What if I do this?
[4365.40s -> 4372.25s]  So I go like this?
[4372.25s -> 4378.43s]  If you're seeing this clip right now, you were one of the few people that were here
[4378.43s -> 4381.34s]  for my longest stream ever.
[4381.34s -> 4390.59s]  13 hours, 18 minutes, and 37 seconds.
[4390.59s -> 4393.31s]  Thanks for hanging out.
[4393.31s -> 4395.61s]  And now, do I do it now?
[4395.61s -> 4401.29s]  13 hours and 20 minutes.
[4401.29s -> 4402.41s]  Moment time.
[4402.41s -> 4405.84s]  Reward viewers for being part of this moment.
[4405.84s -> 4408.88s]  Viewers of this moment will receive a clip added to their moments page.
[4410.91s -> 4412.75s]  You have five moments for this month.
[4412.75s -> 4414.83s]  Longest stream ever.
[4414.83s -> 4420.67s]  13 hours, 18 minutes, 37 seconds.
[4420.67s -> 4424.76s]  Oh, it worked.
[4424.76s -> 4426.44s]  Thanks for hanging out.
[4426.44s -> 4428.80s]  Do I do it now?
[4428.80s -> 4429.84s]  No, no, no, no, hold on.
[4429.84s -> 4430.48s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[4430.48s -> 4431.20s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[4431.20s -> 4431.52s]  Hold on.
[4431.52s -> 4432.80s]  I know, I probably wouldn't want to go to bed.
[4432.80s -> 4433.92s]  That was not a good one.
[4433.92s -> 4435.74s]  Slash moment.
[4435.74s -> 4436.46s]  Okay, here we go.
[4436.46s -> 4442.00s]  Ready?
[4442.00s -> 4447.20s]  You were here for the longest stream I've ever done on this channel.
[4447.20s -> 4451.20s]  13 hours, 19 minutes, and 41 seconds.
[4451.20s -> 4456.83s]  Ain't ever going to happen again.
[4456.83s -> 4458.35s]  What, what, yeah.
[4458.35s -> 4459.15s]  Let's start over.
[4463.80s -> 4467.45s]  Hey, you, I feel like I'm making a YouTube video again.
[4467.45s -> 4471.28s]  I feel like I'm making a fucking YouTube video again.
[4471.28s -> 4473.74s]  You know how many times I would sit here and do this shit?
[4473.74s -> 4478.36s]  I would sit here over and over and over and over again doing this.
[4478.36s -> 4479.00s]  Hey, you.
[4480.36s -> 4483.00s]  I used to sit, I can't do it.
[4483.00s -> 4485.29s]  Okay, I was just going to close my eyes.
[4485.29s -> 4487.53s]  No, I'm just, okay, I'm going to look over here.
[4487.53s -> 4488.57s]  I'm not going to look at you.
[4488.57s -> 4497.42s]  Hey, you are one of the few people that stuck around
[4498.22s -> 4501.18s]  and checked out the longest stream that I've ever done.
[4501.18s -> 4506.88s]  13 hours, 21 minutes, and seven seconds.
[4508.14s -> 4509.39s]  You did.
[4509.39s -> 4510.67s]  You were here for it.
[4510.67s -> 4511.47s]  You were here.
[4512.60s -> 4513.72s]  Thanks a lot.
[4513.72s -> 4517.24s]  And now, I think it's time I got a little bit of rest.
[4517.24s -> 4520.91s]  How was that?
[4527.76s -> 4535.05s]  You are a few people that stuck around and checked out the longest stream that I've ever.
[4535.05s -> 4536.65s]  No, no, we're not doing that one.
[4536.65s -> 4537.45s]  We're doing a different one.
[4557.36s -> 4559.68s]  Hey, just want to say thanks.
[4559.68s -> 4563.88s]  You were here for the longest stream that I've ever done.
[4563.88s -> 4568.44s]  13 hours, 21 minutes, and 38 seconds.
[4568.44s -> 4570.94s]  You were here.
[4570.94s -> 4572.81s]  You were here.
[4572.81s -> 4574.81s]  If you have this moment, if you got this clip,
[4574.81s -> 4578.19s]  congratulations, you own it now.
[4578.19s -> 4579.71s]  Now, it's time to get some rest.
[4579.71s -> 4583.18s]  All right, I did it.
[4583.18s -> 4583.98s]  That should be good, right?
[4595.21s -> 4598.73s]  I look so funny.
[4598.73s -> 4601.45s]  God, dude, who cares?
[4605.26s -> 4606.78s]  This is the, who cares?
[4628.44s -> 4629.24s]  Go watch that.
[4636.84s -> 4641.08s]  I screw it up so bad, but who cares?
[4641.08s -> 4642.44s]  Did you get, did it work?
[4642.44s -> 4654.59s]  Did you claim it?
[4654.59s -> 4655.39s]  I claimed it.
[4655.39s -> 4656.51s]  All right, cool.
[4656.51s -> 4658.27s]  I feel bad for the people that left.
[4660.41s -> 4662.57s]  There's like a couple thousand people left
[4662.57s -> 4663.77s]  because they like all the streams over
[4663.77s -> 4666.83s]  and they're not going to get the clip.
[4666.83s -> 4672.06s]  That's, I feel kind of bad for that.
[4672.06s -> 4672.94s]  Wait, what is it?
[4673.66s -> 4674.86s]  Moments badge.
[4674.86s -> 4680.30s]  Why is the moments badge the body of Christ?
[4687.88s -> 4691.96s]  Okay, you got a moment badge.
[4691.96s -> 4695.07s]  All right, am I, did I officially do it?
[4695.07s -> 4697.07s]  I'm so afraid to hit end stream and it turns out,
[4697.07s -> 4700.67s]  oh dude, it was actually 13 minutes in like 34 minutes
[4700.67s -> 4702.99s]  or 13 hours and 34 minutes or something.
[4702.99s -> 4709.58s]  Should I do another moment?
[4715.60s -> 4717.12s]  Like the 200 people that just left?
[4717.76s -> 4720.51s]  You fucked up.
[4720.51s -> 4724.84s]  Hey, just want to say you are one of the only people
[4724.84s -> 4728.32s]  to get this clip of my longest stream.
[4728.32s -> 4734.14s]  13 hours, 24 minutes and 25 seconds.
[4734.14s -> 4738.43s]  That's right, this is the longest one I've ever done.
[4738.43s -> 4740.06s]  Thanks for watching.
[4740.06s -> 4742.06s]  It's time for me to get some rest.
[4742.06s -> 4755.53s]  Did it work?
[4755.53s -> 4758.01s]  A clip of the moment has failed to capture.
[4758.01s -> 4763.44s]  What are you talking about?
[4763.44s -> 4773.36s]  Hey, I got banned?
[4773.36s -> 4777.21s]  No, I didn't.
[4777.21s -> 4781.08s]  I just want to say you are one of the lucky people.
[4782.30s -> 4783.34s]  Why am I banned?
[4783.34s -> 4786.68s]  You're one of the lucky people that got this moment,
[4786.68s -> 4793.32s]  my longest stream ever at 13 hours, 25 minutes and 24 seconds.
[4793.32s -> 4797.58s]  Nobody else has this but you, this few people.
[4797.58s -> 4799.71s]  It's the longest stream I've ever done.
[4799.71s -> 4801.80s]  Congratulations, you were here.
[4801.80s -> 4802.68s]  You were here.
[4802.68s -> 4804.06s]  Time to get some rest.
[4809.28s -> 4822.03s]  Okay, okay, create moment.
[4822.03s -> 4823.71s]  A clip, it failed.
[4823.71s -> 4828.97s]  Can I only do this like once every 10 minutes?
[4828.97s -> 4832.41s]  I have four more moments to capture this month.
[4832.41s -> 4836.57s]  I think I'm just going to do this every 10 minutes.
[4836.57s -> 4839.47s]  And like, if you want to claim this moment,
[4839.47s -> 4840.67s]  you better stay to the end.
[4840.67s -> 4849.12s]  Do all five of them tonight.
[4852.36s -> 4853.08s]  Can I look this up?
[4853.08s -> 4858.28s]  When do these moments reset?
[4858.28s -> 4859.72s]  Do all five tonight.
[4865.74s -> 4866.70s]  It's in beta?
[4870.06s -> 4873.02s]  At the start of the, yeah, I still have four I can do this month.
[4873.02s -> 4875.66s]  I wonder how long the cooldown is.
[4875.66s -> 4888.81s]  Hey, just want to say, you know what time it is?
[4888.81s -> 4891.61s]  It's the longest stream ever.
[4891.69s -> 4895.85s]  13 hours, 27 minutes and six seconds.
[4895.85s -> 4898.09s]  I think that deserves a quick bite of pizza.
[4900.96s -> 4901.92s]  Thanks for joining me.
[4901.92s -> 4903.12s]  Thanks for sticking around for this long.
[4903.12s -> 4905.68s]  I've never done it this, I've never gone this long before.
[4905.68s -> 4907.21s]  And you were here for it.
[4907.21s -> 4909.04s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[4909.04s -> 4911.44s]  We're here, we're hanging out.
[4911.44s -> 4950.36s]  I'm doing all five of these tonight.
[4950.36s -> 4961.44s]  So it looks like it's about five minutes.
[4961.44s -> 4977.55s]  The last one, I should just be standing back there.
[4977.55s -> 4983.16s]  I'm just going like, you powered through.
[4983.16s -> 4984.84s]  You made it all the way to the end.
[4984.84s -> 4988.04s]  You must be commended for it with this fifth moment.
[4989.61s -> 4992.09s]  And then I spin around, bend over forward
[4992.09s -> 4994.73s]  and fart wicked fucking loud into the microphone.
[4994.73s -> 5004.81s]  Make the camera wider.
[5008.80s -> 5011.28s]  Just get them progressively more fucking weird, hold on.
[5015.71s -> 5025.12s]  If I was like, hey, Jess wanted to say,
[5025.12s -> 5045.69s]  I am so happy that you made it to tonight's stream.
[5045.69s -> 5075.32s]  Hold on a second.
[5075.32s -> 5079.37s]  The camera quality is going to get progressively worse.
[5079.37s -> 5081.93s]  So the actual one that you get is going to be the worst one.
[5092.91s -> 5103.20s]  Where did I go?
[5126.99s -> 5128.75s]  I think I actually broke the webcam.
[5128.75s -> 5140.27s]  Oh, shit.
[5140.27s -> 5142.83s]  Oh, no, it's actually fucked up.
[5142.83s -> 5152.49s]  Hold on.
[5152.49s -> 5153.45s]  Oh, shit.
[5157.47s -> 5164.67s]  Wait, hold on, I might be able to fix it.
[5164.67s -> 5165.71s]  Yeah, it's gone.
[5165.71s -> 5174.03s]  Hold on, did I get it back?
[5174.03s -> 5175.15s]  Oh, I think I got it.
[5175.15s -> 5176.27s]  Hold on a second, we're good.
[5176.27s -> 5191.85s]  Let's see, am I good?
[5209.24s -> 5209.96s]  Maybe.
[5209.96s -> 5211.10s]  You can't see though.
[5211.10s -> 5212.86s]  All right, the cooldown is up.
[5212.86s -> 5220.88s]  I got to fucking do it.
[5220.88s -> 5222.40s]  I don't know, what is that?
[5222.40s -> 5234.89s]  Oh, it's my fucking neck.
[5234.89s -> 5245.05s]  Okay, I got it.
[5245.05s -> 5252.49s]  That looks fine, right?
[5267.96s -> 5279.69s]  Okay, you ready?
[5279.69s -> 5282.04s]  Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[5282.04s -> 5285.24s]  13 hours and 33 minutes, you made it.
[5285.24s -> 5288.73s]  You made it to the longest stream that I've ever done.
[5288.73s -> 5289.77s]  You got it all the way through.
[5289.77s -> 5291.61s]  You were here for this.
[5291.61s -> 5292.57s]  You were here.
[5292.57s -> 5297.77s]  Special thank you to everybody that decided to show up and stick around.
[5297.77s -> 5301.58s]  I got a crunch for you.
[5301.58s -> 5303.61s]  Now that one sucked.
[5303.61s -> 5318.43s]  Again, just want to say a huge special thanks to those of you that stuck around
[5318.43s -> 5321.47s]  for the longest stream that I have ever done.
[5321.55s -> 5325.08s]  We're talking, wow, wowie.
[5325.08s -> 5332.28s]  13 hours and 34 minutes with 18 seconds also, which is unbelievable.
[5333.36s -> 5334.56s]  Thank you for sticking around.
[5334.56s -> 5335.44s]  This is the longest stream.
[5335.44s -> 5336.40s]  I'm never going to do this again.
[5336.40s -> 5337.52s]  The longest stream I've ever done.
[5337.52s -> 5338.32s]  Thank you.
[5338.32s -> 5348.30s]  Did it work?
[5348.30s -> 5355.76s]  Let's go even lower.
[5355.76s -> 5364.32s]  Let's make it worse.
[5364.32s -> 5375.00s]  I hate that I have to do this every time though.
[5375.00s -> 5382.56s]  Oh my goodness, really?
[5382.56s -> 5384.12s]  This looks so bad.
[5411.26s -> 5412.62s]  I can't even see it anymore.
[5412.62s -> 5414.36s]  I keep losing it.
[5414.36s -> 5418.38s]  There it is, okay.
[5418.38s -> 5431.47s]  Every time I go down in quality, it resets the whole camera and resizes everything.
[5431.47s -> 5439.82s]  This is 320 by, I don't know, 320 by like 180 or something.
[5439.82s -> 5446.11s]  It's all blown up and awful.
[5446.11s -> 5449.18s]  Okay, I don't know what the hell that was.
[5449.18s -> 5454.22s]  What am I looking at here?
[5473.04s -> 5477.21s]  Hey man, I can't believe you made it.
[5477.21s -> 5481.21s]  13 hours, 36 minutes and 52 seconds.
[5481.21s -> 5482.49s]  God, man, I can't believe.
[5482.49s -> 5483.68s]  You were here.
[5483.68s -> 5484.40s]  You were here.
[5485.04s -> 5493.53s]  You were longest stream I've ever done.
[5493.53s -> 5494.41s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[5494.41s -> 5495.21s]  I appreciate it, man.
[5497.05s -> 5497.69s]  See you later.
[5500.01s -> 5506.19s]  Did I even give a time?
[5516.78s -> 5518.62s]  52 seconds stream.
[5526.59s -> 5527.71s]  You can't hear that.
[5527.71s -> 5533.36s]  Longest stream I've ever done in 52 seconds.
[5533.36s -> 5534.64s]  God, man, I can't believe.
[5534.64s -> 5535.12s]  You were here.
[5535.84s -> 5536.56s]  You were here.
[5537.12s -> 5541.71s]  You were longest stream I've.
[5541.71s -> 5543.15s]  That's the beginning of the clip.
[5543.15s -> 5544.78s]  Ever done.
[5544.78s -> 5545.82s]  52 seconds.
[5545.82s -> 5547.50s]  God, I gotta redo it, right?
[5548.06s -> 5550.22s]  Should I redo it or is that funny?
[5551.10s -> 5551.58s]  What do you think?
[5553.93s -> 5555.61s]  Oh, 52 seconds.
[5555.61s -> 5557.05s]  Man, I can't believe we made it.
[5561.02s -> 5562.54s]  Oh, it didn't work.
[5562.54s -> 5586.24s]  Oh, hey.
[5586.24s -> 5588.64s]  Oh, I can't believe you're still here.
[5588.64s -> 5594.76s]  Wow, 13 hours, 38 minutes and 44 seconds.
[5594.76s -> 5596.68s]  Wow, that's the longest stream I've ever done.
[5596.68s -> 5598.20s]  And you were here for it.
[5600.16s -> 5600.96s]  Honestly, you know what?
[5600.96s -> 5603.20s]  I think that deserves a little bit of a bite of pizza.
[5603.20s -> 5615.69s]  Is the game too loud?
[5615.69s -> 5616.33s]  Oh, shit.
[5617.13s -> 5619.96s]  Oh, hey.
[5619.96s -> 5621.88s]  Oh, I can't believe you're still here.
[5621.88s -> 5623.08s]  No, I'll do it again.
[5623.08s -> 5624.94s]  Music's too loud.
[5624.94s -> 5631.20s]  The music's way too loud.
[5631.20s -> 5632.24s]  Okay, I'm good.
[5635.13s -> 5636.25s]  It wouldn't work anyways.
[5636.25s -> 5640.04s]  Take three.
[5645.28s -> 5651.08s]  Oh, hey.
[5651.08s -> 5653.53s]  Oh, you're still here.
[5653.53s -> 5656.78s]  Wow, 13 hours, 39 minutes.
[5656.78s -> 5658.86s]  Longest stream I've ever done.
[5658.86s -> 5660.57s]  And you were here for it.
[5660.57s -> 5663.37s]  I'll never do anything longer than this.
[5663.37s -> 5665.39s]  So you're here for it.
[5665.39s -> 5666.03s]  Good work.
[5667.84s -> 5669.34s]  Oh, what's that?
[5669.34s -> 5675.21s]  Oh, is that some Captain Grunch?
[5675.21s -> 5675.93s]  Delicious.
[5675.93s -> 5687.61s]  What a reward for 13 hours and 40 minutes.
[5687.61s -> 5691.05s]  13 hours, 39 minutes, longest stream I've ever done.
[5691.05s -> 5692.09s]  Oh, fuck you.
[5692.09s -> 5692.97s]  It didn't get it.
[5692.97s -> 5699.21s]  Where even is this?
[5699.21s -> 5700.09s]  Up there.
[5700.09s -> 5718.08s]  Where is this?
[5718.08s -> 5730.54s]  I don't know where it is.
[5732.43s -> 5732.99s]  You know what?
[5732.99s -> 5738.65s]  You made it to 13 hours, 41 minutes and 8 seconds.
[5738.65s -> 5739.88s]  You did.
[5739.88s -> 5741.72s]  You were here for this.
[5741.72s -> 5743.16s]  Thank you so much for sticking around.
[5743.16s -> 5745.40s]  Longest stream that I have ever done.
[5745.40s -> 5747.13s]  And you're here for it.
[5747.13s -> 5747.93s]  Yeah.
[5747.93s -> 5751.96s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[5751.96s -> 5760.62s]  quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick.
[5760.62s -> 5763.56s]  That's a good one.
[5763.56s -> 5766.30s]  I don't understand, I don't know where it is.
[5766.30s -> 5769.40s]  I don't, you know what, you made it to 13 hours,
[5770.83s -> 5775.90s]  41 minutes and a-
[5775.90s -> 5778.90s]  Alright, I'm done doing this.
[5778.90s -> 5780.02s]  You should lower your mic quality.
[5780.02s -> 5781.26s]  Dude, I'm not fucked with the mic.
[5781.26s -> 5785.50s]  I took me 10 years to get to this point.
[5785.50s -> 5788.64s]  I'm doing one more, and I'm just gonna say thanks.
[5788.64s -> 5794.44s]  That's 13 hours and 42 minutes, I'm done.
[5794.44s -> 5814.00s]  Do I keep, like, the cringe guy routine going?
[5814.00s -> 5824.12s]  Oh my god, I don't know how I'm gonna be able to do this.
[5824.12s -> 5840.46s]  It's so ugly.
[5840.46s -> 5847.34s]  What is that?
[5847.34s -> 5851.38s]  Okay, that's here.
[5851.38s -> 5864.88s]  Hold on, let me find it here.
[5864.88s -> 5949.73s]  Okay, so I need to move it this way.
[5949.73s -> 5959.82s]  Don't ever call the sus guy three.
[5959.82s -> 5961.82s]  13 hours and 44 minutes,
[5961.82s -> 5983.82s]  you made it to the longest stream I've ever done.
[5983.82s -> 5993.91s]  Don't ever call the sus guy three.
[5993.91s -> 5995.91s]  13 hours and 44 minutes,
[5995.91s -> 5999.45s]  you made it to the longest stream I've ever done.
[5999.45s -> 6001.81s]  I was gonna say final stream.
[6002.99s -> 6005.93s]  You made it to the final stream.
[6005.93s -> 6008.65s]  Okay, please tell me this is gonna actually go through.
[6009.65s -> 6011.65s]  No, it didn't go through.
[6011.65s -> 6012.49s]  It didn't go through.
[6012.49s -> 6013.31s]  Somebody clip it.
[6013.31s -> 6015.96s]  Oh, shit.
[6015.96s -> 6023.27s]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[6023.27s -> 6034.63s]  Don't ever call the sus guy at three a.m.
[6034.63s -> 6040.26s]  You made it 13 hours 46 minutes and 11 seconds.
[6043.91s -> 6053.46s]  You made it to the longest stream I've ever done.
[6053.46s -> 6054.66s]  See you on the next one.
[6056.50s -> 6068.66s]  I'm gonna cut it off.
[6068.66s -> 6070.53s]  You made it.
[6070.53s -> 6073.21s]  13 hours.
[6073.21s -> 6075.50s]  Fuck, God damn it.
[6075.50s -> 6076.98s]  All right, I'm doing this one more time and that's it.
[6076.98s -> 6082.22s]  Then I'm done.
[6082.22s -> 6091.71s]  Don't ever call the sus guy at three a.m.
[6091.71s -> 6094.11s]  You made it to the longest stream I've ever done.
[6094.11s -> 6098.39s]  13 hours 47 minutes and seven seconds.
[6098.39s -> 6102.71s]  And your prize is this stupid clip
[6102.71s -> 6105.51s]  that you're gonna forget about in two weeks.
[6120.89s -> 6121.73s]  What the fuck?
[6121.73s -> 6123.97s]  Why does he keep cutting it off?
[6123.97s -> 6126.37s]  You made it to the longest stream.
[6126.37s -> 6127.65s]  I'm gonna do it quick.
[6127.65s -> 6128.49s]  This is annoying.
[6128.49s -> 6132.48s]  It keeps cutting the beginning off.
[6132.48s -> 6135.08s]  Don't ever call the sus guy at three a.m.
[6138.24s -> 6140.36s]  You made it to the longest stream I've ever done
[6140.36s -> 6149.30s]  and your reward is the 13 hours 48 minutes zero second.
[6149.92s -> 6151.04s]  You win.
[6151.04s -> 6155.67s]  All right, did I get it?
[6155.67s -> 6157.79s]  Why does he keep cutting it off?
[6158.39s -> 6160.17s]  You made it to the longest stream.
[6160.17s -> 6161.29s]  I'm gonna do it quick.
[6161.29s -> 6162.13s]  What?
[6162.13s -> 6162.97s]  This is annoying.
[6162.97s -> 6164.29s]  It keeps cutting the beginning off.
[6164.29s -> 6166.33s]  Now it's only beginning.
[6166.33s -> 6186.71s]  Don't ever call the sus guy at three a.m.
[6186.71s -> 6188.93s]  Ah, you made it.
[6188.93s -> 6191.48s]  Three a.m.
[6191.48s -> 6193.26s]  Put the phone down.
[6193.26s -> 6196.35s]  Don't call me.
[6196.35s -> 6199.43s]  13 hours 48 minutes and 50 seconds.
[6199.43s -> 6201.47s]  Congratulations.
[6201.47s -> 6206.62s]  You've made it to the longest stream I've ever done.
[6206.62s -> 6209.98s]  Congratulations.
[6209.98s -> 6212.18s]  Oh, what's that?
[6212.18s -> 6217.12s]  A pizza.
[6217.12s -> 6218.32s]  Shit, it doesn't work.
[6218.32s -> 6230.26s]  This is not connected to the right mic.
[6230.26s -> 6233.38s]  13 hours 48 minutes and 50 seconds.
[6233.38s -> 6235.39s]  Congratulations.
[6235.39s -> 6237.99s]  You've made it to the longest stream I've ever done.
[6237.99s -> 6239.07s]  Put the phone down.
[6239.07s -> 6240.59s]  Don't call me.
[6240.59s -> 6243.91s]  Congratulations.
[6243.91s -> 6244.83s]  Oh, what's that?
[6246.12s -> 6251.08s]  A pizza.
[6251.08s -> 6251.92s]  Shit, it doesn't.
[6251.92s -> 6253.60s]  Put the phone down.
[6253.60s -> 6255.00s]  Whatever, you, here it is.
[6256.54s -> 6257.38s]  There it is.
[6257.38s -> 6258.46s]  There it is, your actual clip.
[6258.46s -> 6262.34s]  Goodbye.
[6262.34s -> 6263.68s]  Don't put the phone down.
[6263.68s -> 6265.44s]  Don't call me.
[6266.24s -> 6267.08s]  Oh my God.
[6267.08s -> 6267.90s]  All right, that's it.
[6267.90s -> 6269.78s]  That's the last one.
[6269.78s -> 6272.11s]  That's it.
[6272.11s -> 6272.95s]  Who cares?
[6278.94s -> 6286.04s]  We're almost at 14 hours I'm staying.
[6286.04s -> 6286.88s]  It's 10 minutes.
[6286.88s -> 6288.36s]  I don't like that 13.
[6288.36s -> 6291.04s]  It's gotta be 14.
[6291.04s -> 6297.09s]  That's long enough for the ending stuff.
[6297.09s -> 6297.93s]  No, thanks for watching.
[6297.93s -> 6299.57s]  I really did not,
[6301.94s -> 6304.92s]  I did not think I was gonna do a 14 hour stream tonight.
[6304.92s -> 6306.98s]  I thought I was gonna do like a six hour stream
[6306.98s -> 6308.92s]  and then like a six hour stream tomorrow
[6308.92s -> 6311.20s]  and then like a four hour stream on Sunday.
[6311.20s -> 6312.40s]  But you know, whatever.
[6314.07s -> 6316.75s]  Sometimes you just go for it.
[6316.75s -> 6317.59s]  That was fun.
[6317.59s -> 6323.30s]  I feel like we did a lot of stuff.
[6323.30s -> 6333.79s]  Oh, the mic is wrong, whoops.
[6333.79s -> 6335.59s]  Hey, there you are.
[6335.59s -> 6337.88s]  That's better, isn't it?
[6337.88s -> 6338.84s]  Hi, okay.
[6338.84s -> 6342.34s]  Now you can hear me, cool.
[6342.34s -> 6350.43s]  You heard that too, whoops.
[6350.43s -> 6355.99s]  Claimed.
[6355.99s -> 6362.64s]  The other mic is better.
[6362.64s -> 6368.71s]  Yeah, honest to God, complete real talk.
[6368.71s -> 6371.41s]  There is no way I will do a 14 hour stream
[6371.41s -> 6383.33s]  probably ever again.
[6383.33s -> 6386.02s]  Don't think so.
[6386.02s -> 6387.99s]  Seaman was 11 hours.
[6387.99s -> 6392.46s]  Lord of the Rings PlayStation 2 games with 13.
[6392.46s -> 6394.06s]  This was not a single game.
[6394.06s -> 6398.30s]  So there it is at the top of the list.
[6398.30s -> 6404.30s]  It is, oh, there it is.
[6404.30s -> 6408.78s]  13.4, 13.1, what was 12?
[6408.78s -> 6413.24s]  Lifeline was 12 hours.
[6413.24s -> 6421.39s]  Simpsons Hit and Run was 11.8, so just about 12.
[6421.39s -> 6425.71s]  Darkwood, I played Darkwood for 11 and a half hours?
[6425.71s -> 6427.62s]  How?
[6427.62s -> 6430.48s]  I don't think I would have been able to do that.
[6430.48s -> 6437.30s]  Holy shit.
[6437.34s -> 6448.64s]  And then what's this one that's 11.2 hours?
[6448.64s -> 6452.46s]  Oh, the thing, right.
[6452.46s -> 6456.06s]  Sometimes you're just gaming, that's right.
[6456.06s -> 6459.68s]  All right, we got seven minutes.
[6459.68s -> 6461.82s]  What do you wanna talk about?
[6461.82s -> 6471.89s]  Just roll the credits again.
[6471.89s -> 6473.73s]  Imagine not having a tier two badge.
[6478.10s -> 6481.86s]  If you claim to all four of those, do you get to,
[6481.86s -> 6483.28s]  by the way, that's probably the only time
[6483.28s -> 6485.04s]  I'm ever gonna do moments.
[6485.04s -> 6490.50s]  So if you got it, that's probably never happening again.
[6490.50s -> 6492.18s]  My thoughts on Christmas?
[6492.18s -> 6496.52s]  I like it, it's cool.
[6496.52s -> 6498.12s]  I'm really surprised by the amount of people
[6498.12s -> 6499.16s]  that are still here.
[6499.16s -> 6507.75s]  So thanks for staying up or waking up in the morning.
[6507.75s -> 6518.79s]  It's gonna be a very long VOD to go through.
[6518.79s -> 6523.12s]  Thanks for fucking my sleep up.
[6523.12s -> 6526.24s]  Yeah, I mean, I'm about to go eat a little bit more food,
[6526.24s -> 6528.89s]  probably take a shower or a bath or something,
[6528.89s -> 6531.62s]  and probably not fall asleep till like four,
[6531.62s -> 6533.89s]  so maybe five.
[6533.89s -> 6535.09s]  I think I'm right there with you.
[6535.09s -> 6538.79s]  I think we may have all collectively screwed up
[6538.79s -> 6544.97s]  some sleep schedules.
[6544.97s -> 6550.77s]  It's 5 a.m. right now.
[6550.77s -> 6552.65s]  Thanks for fixing my sleep schedule.
[6552.65s -> 6553.89s]  Oh, there we go.
[6553.89s -> 6561.66s]  Not all bad.
[6562.62s -> 6567.47s]  Oh man, there it is.
[6567.47s -> 6575.06s]  You knew it was coming.
[6575.06s -> 6576.78s]  You stream it again this evening?
[6576.78s -> 6580.03s]  No, I don't think so.
[6580.03s -> 6581.67s]  I gotta see how I get up at some point
[6581.67s -> 6587.46s]  in the hopefully early afternoon-ish.
[6587.46s -> 6588.70s]  I don't wanna get up late though.
[6588.70s -> 6590.30s]  I've been on a really good schedule.
[6590.30s -> 6592.44s]  I've been getting up normally.
[6592.44s -> 6595.94s]  I've been on a very good schedule for a long, long time.
[6595.94s -> 6608.10s]  I might just try to just make myself get up in the morning.
[6608.10s -> 6611.22s]  I've been so good for the last couple of years,
[6611.22s -> 6617.57s]  probably like the last year straight.
[6617.57s -> 6620.00s]  What are you gonna do on Sunday or Monday?
[6622.19s -> 6624.98s]  Probably switch.
[6624.98s -> 6628.06s]  I might jump into Splatoon 3,
[6628.06s -> 6629.44s]  because I was told that the campaign
[6629.44s -> 6633.14s]  is actually completely different than the multiplayer game.
[6633.14s -> 6637.15s]  I'll play the multiplayer too, whatever.
[6637.15s -> 6639.11s]  It's gonna be a coin flip between Splatoon 3
[6639.11s -> 6645.69s]  and Breath of the Wild on Sunday or Monday.
[6645.69s -> 6649.37s]  What time on Sunday or Monday?
[6649.37s -> 6651.09s]  Probably around the same time,
[6651.09s -> 6657.35s]  probably around two specific.
[6657.35s -> 6660.28s]  If you're in the pre-stream, we'll figure it out.
[6660.28s -> 6662.28s]  It's either Sunday or tomorrow, whatever,
[6662.28s -> 6669.10s]  Sunday, whatever, or Monday-ish.
[6669.10s -> 6671.08s]  Are you gonna play both or just one or the other?
[6671.08s -> 6674.32s]  I have a feeling if I'm gonna play one of those two,
[6674.32s -> 6677.24s]  I'm gonna play that for a majority of that stream.
[6677.24s -> 6678.80s]  You don't just play Breath of the Wild
[6678.80s -> 6681.68s]  for an hour and 40 minutes.
[6681.68s -> 6683.32s]  That's, it's the whole day.
[6683.32s -> 6685.74s]  That's the stream, right?
[6685.74s -> 6694.52s]  Unless I don't like it, which would be surprising.
[6694.52s -> 6695.64s]  It's been long enough.
[6695.64s -> 6698.76s]  I know everyone said don't play that
[6698.76s -> 6702.04s]  after you play Elden Ring,
[6702.04s -> 6704.76s]  but it's been a long time since Elden Ring came out.
[6704.76s -> 6708.59s]  I think it'll be okay.
[6708.59s -> 6710.47s]  I hope you don't compare it to Elden Ring.
[6710.47s -> 6718.53s]  I don't think so.
[6718.57s -> 6724.84s]  Hey, in two and a half minutes, it'll be 14 hours.
[6724.84s -> 6726.32s]  I kinda wanna see the reactions from people
[6726.32s -> 6728.36s]  that just thought this was gonna be a five,
[6728.36s -> 6729.64s]  they probably, you know what?
[6729.64s -> 6732.84s]  A lot of people that show up to check out the VOD
[6732.84s -> 6735.04s]  will probably think I got addicted to one of these games
[6735.04s -> 6737.16s]  and had an absolute meltdown,
[6737.16s -> 6748.94s]  and it was just mayhem for 14 hours.
[6748.94s -> 6751.10s]  You did, you did get addicted.
[6751.10s -> 6754.48s]  Oh, that's what happened.
[6754.48s -> 6760.18s]  Yeah, but that Oriole game was effectively
[6760.18s -> 6763.58s]  one five-hour block of this.
[6763.58s -> 6764.58s]  It wasn't the whole thing.
[6764.58s -> 6771.83s]  I didn't take 14 hours to beat that Oriole game.
[6771.83s -> 6773.96s]  Hey, you know, you can,
[6773.96s -> 6783.45s]  that Oriole game is the reason why I did this 14-hour stream,
[6783.45s -> 6787.29s]  because I knew for a fact if I were to put it down,
[6787.29s -> 6789.74s]  I would not have gone back to it.
[6789.74s -> 6792.17s]  I just wouldn't have, even though I loved it.
[6792.17s -> 6798.22s]  Other things would have just gotten priority for stream.
[6798.22s -> 6800.22s]  That was the only opportunity to play it and beat it,
[6800.22s -> 6804.96s]  unless I did it off stream.
[6804.96s -> 6807.68s]  All right, let's get the, let's roll the end here.
[6807.68s -> 6809.75s]  Thanks, everybody.
[6809.75s -> 6813.20s]  I'll see you guys in a day or two.
[6813.24s -> 6819.38s]  I am going to go do some stretches and go lie down.
[6819.50s -> 6820.58s]  Have a great night, everybody.
[6820.58s -> 6822.82s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[6822.82s -> 6827.12s]  Hopefully you had a good time.
[6827.12s -> 6831.00s]  I definitely have to end it like at 14, zero, zero.
[6831.00s -> 6832.32s]  I don't really care about the seconds,
[6832.32s -> 6834.64s]  but that's a clean 14, right?
[6834.64s -> 6840.71s]  14 hours, but that's in 30 seconds.
[6840.71s -> 6841.79s]  Good night, guys.
[6841.79s -> 6842.61s]  See you soon.
[6842.61s -> 6844.91s]  Keep an eye on the sus tomorrow and Sunday.
[6844.91s -> 6849.47s]  I'm sure I'll update you a little bit.
[6849.47s -> 6851.78s]  Good night, goodbye.
[6851.78s -> 6853.04s]  Take care of yourselves and get some sleep
[6853.04s -> 6854.82s]  if you stayed up or good morning.
[6854.82s -> 6858.83s]  Hope you have a good rest of your Saturday.
[6858.83s -> 6859.67s]  See you later.
