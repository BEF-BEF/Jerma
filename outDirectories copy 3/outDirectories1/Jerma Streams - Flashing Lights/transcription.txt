[1.72s -> 9.96s]  Welcome to 2020. I know it's been, it's been four days, but you know, it's 2020 nonetheless.
[9.96s -> 15.90s]  How are you? God, shut up already. What? I just turned it on. What are you talking about?
[17.53s -> 28.47s]  Hey, hey. Oh God. First comment I read in 2020 is that great. It was a good start. Anyways,
[29.98s -> 33.80s]  starting a little late today. The plan originally was we were going to do
[35.06s -> 41.70s]  keep talking and everybody will be whatever. Keep talking and nobody explodes with Joel,
[41.70s -> 46.66s]  but Joel's not feeling well. He kind of last second was like, I'm sorry to do that. I feel
[46.66s -> 50.26s]  like shit right now. And I'm like, don't, it's all good. Don't fucking worry about it. It's all good.
[51.46s -> 58.81s]  We're just going to do it tomorrow. So today, today we're going to do something else.
[59.53s -> 65.69s]  And what we're going to do is I've got a lot of games to play. I've got a huge list over the
[65.69s -> 70.89s]  last couple of days, at least I've been compiling at least what I want to start to do in 2020.
[71.77s -> 76.04s]  Derma falls on the street. Yeah. And I also, I've looked at the images.
[76.92s -> 83.56s]  I've seen the images of the, everyone that like weird mutant face that I have when I'm in the
[83.56s -> 94.06s]  chair. I know it looks doctored, but it isn't, but it, it looks bad. I know, I know I've seen it.
[95.30s -> 98.98s]  Anyways, we don't have the idea because we're starting really late. So I want to kind of get
[98.98s -> 106.34s]  right into this. So here comes the game. This is, this is flashing lights is the game. This
[106.34s -> 114.02s]  actually was requested more than once. This is a requested video game. This is a game we play as
[114.02s -> 122.31s]  police, ambulance and fire. No, not like not actual flashing lights. You know, you're not
[122.31s -> 133.22s]  going to get like flashed. This was requested twice. I don't, I have no, I saw the screenshots. I saw
[133.22s -> 138.98s]  like a few seconds of the trailer and I'm like, okay, fine. All right. I'll give it a try.
[141.88s -> 150.07s]  I'll give it a try. If this game is not, if we, I got two other like last minute additions,
[150.07s -> 157.35s]  that should be fun. Uh, we did a poll earlier and this is what was voted for. Again, 2020 is going
[157.35s -> 162.71s]  to be no different. I'm going to make this really, really clear. The power of the pre-stream chat.
[162.71s -> 170.18s]  This got like 70% of the vote. And if you want to know what it beat out, it beat out Katana Zero
[171.06s -> 177.42s]  and Wizorb. Just say it. The power of the pre-stream chat. Don't think you don't have power.
[177.42s -> 189.00s]  Somebody just wrote seriously? Seriously? Anyway, let's go. I don't know. Let's play.
[189.00s -> 196.90s]  This is called flashing lights. Uh, max vehicle traffic. Why don't we make this, um,
[200.94s -> 210.44s]  why do I have to do this? Max pedestrians. Yeah, you know, I want 99 vehicles. Sorry,
[210.44s -> 220.55s]  it's 20. Uh, okay. How about 12? Parked vehicle density, medium high, medium time,
[220.55s -> 229.34s]  day fuel consumption, medium, I guess. Is this like a simulator? Do I, is it like a tutorial?
[229.34s -> 234.92s]  There's 12 people in the whole city. All right. Is it, do I, this is really low volume too. Hold on.
[235.72s -> 238.92s]  This is going to be really high volume in about five seconds. Guarantee it. Let's find out.
[239.56s -> 251.19s]  I'm not looking forward to this. I'm scared. This is really, really, it's going to be really
[251.19s -> 268.73s]  fucking loud. Is this the same image? Wait, what? Is that a tank? Why is there a tank? Oh, hold on.
[268.73s -> 275.45s]  Can you hear this? And now you can. All right. Police firefighter or medic. Which one do you
[275.45s -> 285.21s]  want to start with? Uh, I feel like the title of the stream is doctor officer fireman. So we're
[285.21s -> 292.46s]  going to start as doctor. Let's do medic. And this, I can't hear anything. Medic. Done. Uh, male.
[293.34s -> 300.87s]  Okay. Uh, three bodies. Okay. You can either, you can wear a Christmas hat,
[303.26s -> 314.15s]  um, and sunglasses. At what point do you just not have a character creator? I'm just going to be
[314.15s -> 323.08s]  completely honest. Like just, do you really need sunglasses? There's three options. Like,
[323.08s -> 329.29s]  do you really need sunglasses? This is the EMT from the rumble. Holy shit. It actually is.
[333.00s -> 340.30s]  Oh my God. That's fucked up. That's really what it is. Uh, we had huge bits come in from
[340.30s -> 346.58s]  bilateral lich. Thank you for electric for the 5,000 bits. They say Jeremy is the police monkey.
[346.58s -> 353.22s]  S well, not yet. I'm the medic. All right. We're going to go with this. This is fine.
[356.52s -> 362.57s]  So I have to go help people, but seriously, thank you for the fucking $50 by luxury
[363.53s -> 370.84s]  starting 2020 off with huge money already. Thank you. I got to turn this up. This is really low.
[377.61s -> 387.88s]  Okay. Emergency medical service. It's like, it's like an open world. All right. Let me turn this
[387.88s -> 405.90s]  up. 75, 70, 77, 78, 79. Unconscious person at address green tag. What? Hold on. Address unconscious
[405.90s -> 412.50s]  person at address green tag. Call ID respond. Okay. Except unconscious person at green tag.
[413.14s -> 419.38s]  How do I get in a car? David too is responding to unconscious person. All right. I get in.
[420.18s -> 430.25s]  I don't even get a tutorial. Engine on. Okay. Lights sign. How do I drive right now? This is
[430.25s -> 439.45s]  fucking loud. Now we, of course it is. It's one of those loud and soft games. All right. 65 sounds
[439.45s -> 446.68s]  all right to me. All right. Here we go. Unconscious person over at green. Do I turn my siren on?
[453.50s -> 461.08s]  What? I got minus points because I bumped a stop sign. Really? Okay. How long do I have?
[461.88s -> 466.74s]  Do you have to follow the rule? I feel like I'm explaining Grand Theft Auto. All right. Hold on.
[467.62s -> 477.70s]  Unconscious person. See, I'm not making any, there's no damage. I just, I skimmed that person.
[477.70s -> 480.18s]  Inspect the person. Check if they can be transported to the hospital.
[491.48s -> 500.55s]  Interact using med bag. Where's my med bag? Why can you punch as a medic? Why? Why can you punch
[500.55s -> 507.99s]  as a medic? Okay. Med bag. Interact using med bag or other items from your vehicle trunk.
[508.79s -> 522.12s]  Okay. Let's get it out. Items. Okay. Stretcher. I got to put this guy on the stretcher.
[525.66s -> 542.54s]  Uh, what the fuck is going on? All right. How do I put them on? I put you on the stretcher.
[543.26s -> 546.30s]  Don't run them over. I'm not going to run them over. Oh, wait, here we go. Okay.
[547.67s -> 564.57s]  Wait, why is there an indicator over his head? Um, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Hold on.
[564.57s -> 571.37s]  Can I go back in here? You got a nerd neck. All right. What do we got? Technical defibrillator.
[572.01s -> 586.71s]  This is my first day. I'm sorry. Okay. Shock pads. Remove top part of clothing. What? What do you
[586.71s -> 604.07s]  mean? What do you mean remove top part of cloth? How do I, how, what? All right. Well, this doesn't
[604.07s -> 620.04s]  work. Um, items. Fracture kit. Medic bag. All right. Medic bag. I got it. Inspect patient. Here we go.
[620.04s -> 627.06s]  All right. What's wrong? You hit your head? Breathing. He has pulse. Unconscious. Uh, what
[627.06s -> 633.21s]  about his stomach? Inspect it. He has a pulse. You can feel a pulse from somebody's stomach?
[633.85s -> 647.05s]  It has pulse. Okay. You have a pulse. You have a pulse. You have a pulse. All right. I've,
[647.05s -> 654.44s]  you, I do have to use the defibrillator. All right. Where's that? Where's the, oh shit. Um,

[670.04s -> 680.66s]  Okay. Um, what? Okay. Uh, grab the stretcher from the ambulance and load the patient
[680.66s -> 686.74s]  to deliver to the hospital. Wait, his friend's leaving. I'm not done. You, you might, can you,
[686.74s -> 701.26s]  uh, okay. His friend's leaving. How do I, he has a pulse. He's good. Did I really knock a car over?
[701.26s -> 710.38s]  All right. But how do I put him on the stretcher? I need a second EMT for this. How do you put him
[710.38s -> 723.64s]  on the stretcher? Using med bag. Can I lower the stretcher? Is there any other buttons I can press?
[726.10s -> 732.65s]  Inspect you. Wait, let me give him the med bag. Give me the med bag. Okay. Let's try that. So
[732.65s -> 741.11s]  perform CPR. Neck collar. Uh, okay. I got a call. I got him in a neck collar. His neck was injured.
[741.91s -> 757.22s]  Okay. Um, now transport. Request transport. Wait, I am the ambulance. Unconscious person. Dispatch
[757.22s -> 764.23s]  received. Aren't I the ambulance? So why did an ambulance just call an ambulance?
[767.96s -> 772.34s]  I can't get him on the stretcher. Why would I call the ambulance?
[772.34s -> 779.34s]  Well, are they coming? Oh, there they are. Oh, don't worry. We'll take it from here.
[787.13s -> 798.25s]  Wait, there's a vehicle incident. Vehicle incident. Respond. Code three. Wait, I'm not yet. I want to
[798.25s -> 803.50s]  see what happens here. Well, you just kind of scooped him up. All right, let's go. Vehicle
[803.50s -> 811.48s]  incident. I got to load this stuff back onto the car. How do you put people on? That does a weird
[811.48s -> 818.54s]  indicator there and I'm not sure what it is. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you for putting it in.
[819.26s -> 824.46s]  You helped me put it back in the trunk. Good job. Oh, gunshot. Oh, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I got
[824.46s -> 835.56s]  to put my, I got to put my stereos back in. Just get out of the way. Get out of the way. Out of the
[835.56s -> 849.18s]  way. Okay. Can I not pick this up? Pick it up. I, there's nobody, there's nobody on the ground.
[849.18s -> 858.74s]  Why is it, why am I getting this? Remove all. Okay. All right, let's go. All right, vehicle incident.
[858.74s -> 875.77s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Why can't I drive? Am I driving the car in front of me? Oh, shit,
[875.77s -> 893.08s]  I'm in the wrong seat. Hold on. Okay, let's go. Where was it? Oh, it's all the way up here.
[894.25s -> 907.88s]  That's so far away. Filactory. Again, another $50. Holy shit, dude. 5,000 bits from file. I need you,
[907.88s -> 911.48s]  I need you to find out how many ambulances you can call at once. I was thinking about doing that,
[912.28s -> 919.43s]  but I think no, not quite. We're not quite there yet. We're not there yet. But yeah, I feel you.
[921.05s -> 931.50s]  Yeah, I want to call every single emergency service. Vehicle incident. Is there a handbrake?
[932.14s -> 943.13s]  Shit. Is this pre-recorded? Uh, no, it is not. Those of you that just trickled in,
[943.13s -> 947.45s]  Joel and I were going to play keep talking to nobody explodes today, but Joel was not feeling
[947.45s -> 953.43s]  well. Uh, he kind of just, uh, right at the, right before we were about to start, he was just like,
[953.43s -> 959.67s]  I fucking feel like shit right now. He just, it just jumped on him. So we're going to do it tomorrow.
[962.90s -> 978.12s]  Joel's health is more important. Defusing fake bombs. Seriously, this is, why do I have to go
[978.12s -> 986.54s]  all the way around here? This is no better way for me to go. This is just trying to hit me.
[991.88s -> 1007.69s]  This is the worst emergency route ever. Why is it not an emergency route? Multi-lane driving. No,
[1007.69s -> 1010.41s]  shouldn't, shouldn't it be like an off road that's, wait, this is the wrong way.
[1011.29s -> 1021.66s]  All right. What's the other siren? Is there no other siren? Wait, I can turn my blinkers on?
[1022.62s -> 1039.80s]  Why, for what? Whoa. Okay. I'm fine. That was actually scary because I have to call an ambulance.
[1041.22s -> 1042.90s]  I have to call an ambulance.
[1049.67s -> 1062.66s]  All right. I gotta call an ambulance. Hey, where's my medic bag? Okay. Need an ambulance.
[1063.22s -> 1067.00s]  How do I call an ambulance? I can run there. I can run there. I can run there.
[1071.08s -> 1078.92s]  It's right there. I got my medic bag. I can, I can call the, I can call for another ambulance.
[1079.48s -> 1094.07s]  What the fuck was that? Okay. Imagine, imagine you got in a car accident and you look down,
[1094.07s -> 1100.07s]  you got like a broken leg and you look down the, all the way down here and you see the medic
[1100.07s -> 1107.50s]  and EMT running up the hill with a bag. How disappointed would you be?
[1111.06s -> 1114.58s]  And you look even further down, you see that he drove into a ditch. All right. I'm here. I'm here.
[1114.58s -> 1126.02s]  I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. How's the patient? Inspect the person. Okay. There's the tank.
[1127.56s -> 1155.94s]  All right. What happened here? Leg, broken leg? No. Wait, what did it say? Not breathing, no pulse.
[1158.76s -> 1204.92s]  Okay. Um, perform CPR. Uh, what? How do you do CPR? How do you CPR? Does this get dead? Okay. Um,
[1206.31s -> 1214.39s]  I need the defib. I need the defib. All right. I'll be right back. Wait, wait. Can I have your car?
[1217.24s -> 1229.46s]  Can I borrow your car? Can I take this car? Okay. Let me request an ambulance. Let me request an
[1229.46s -> 1248.34s]  ambulance. Okay. Request transport. Patients not ready for transport. God damn it. You can't get
[1248.34s -> 1258.04s]  hurt. Can you, can you reset the car? I don't think so. Not that I'm aware of.
[1267.93s -> 1271.45s]  Can I get the car? I think I can get the car out of the ditch. I can, I think I can move it.
[1277.06s -> 1280.26s]  Yeah. I think somebody just mentioned it. Why is there a jump even programmed into the game?
[1280.82s -> 1285.40s]  Just for fun? I mean, I guess that's just kind of for fun. You can reset the car.
[1293.54s -> 1300.94s]  How? All right. If I get out and move like this. Okay. Here we go. I got it. Why didn't I do it?
[1300.94s -> 1304.38s]  I should have just done this in the first place. God damn it. Okay. Whatever. It's fine.
[1305.02s -> 1326.49s]  Do I need gas? I think I need gas. I need the stretcher. Do you need the stretcher?
[1327.37s -> 1334.54s]  No, I don't. I need the defib. How did that even fall out? The doors are closed. What the
[1334.54s -> 1341.56s]  fuck are they talking about? All right. I'm here. No, thanks to you two officers. Thanks a lot.
[1342.28s -> 1353.37s]  All right. Give me my, look, stretcher. Items. Stretcher. Items. Um, was it defib?
[1353.37s -> 1364.74s]  Technical. Defib. Let's go. Okay. Let's put it on. Here we go. I'm here. What does that mean?
[1365.38s -> 1368.15s]  What does that mean? What does that mean? What does that mean? What does that mean?
[1369.46s -> 1384.28s]  What does that mean? Does anybody know what that means? How many times do you have to do this?
[1384.84s -> 1399.74s]  Okay. Is he alive? He's alive. Right? All right. Let's go. Give me my med bag.
[1403.06s -> 1431.03s]  Uh, hold on. Is he alive? No pulse. I killed him. The patient's not ready for transportation.
[1433.11s -> 1454.63s]  Didn't, didn't he just have a pulse? Look, see? Patient's not ready for transportation.
[1456.42s -> 1477.69s]  Do I have to have the stretcher? Where is the stretcher? Back here? It's not that far.
[1478.73s -> 1493.18s]  You have to put his clothes back on. Why is it so hard for me to drive over this road?
[1496.33s -> 1507.86s]  Where's the stretcher? Isn't it right here? It was right here. Another $50 from Phylactery?
[1507.86s -> 1516.97s]  Holy shit, Phylactery. Really? Oh my God. Get boots. All right. Put that in. Let's go.
[1522.60s -> 1541.38s]  All right. Get over here. I'm just learning. I'm learning how to play. Please don't do this again.
[1543.13s -> 1552.71s]  Move. Bro, you need to learn how to read. No, I don't. Speaking of reading, five community subs.
[1552.71s -> 1560.04s]  I can read that from Flinzenberg. Thank you Flinzenberg for the five subs and Vilemi for
[1561.00s -> 1567.40s]  there's more money coming in. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. There's a shitload of money coming in.
[1568.78s -> 1575.34s]  You guys didn't stop from New Year's Eve. Oh my goodness. He can only read Greed. It's not true.
[1576.54s -> 1581.50s]  Vilemi, 5,000 fucking bits from Vilemi. If I'm ever dying, I hope to God you're not the EMT
[1581.50s -> 1587.10s]  that responds to my 911 call. Well, I wouldn't because I'm not an EMT. I'm an internet clown.
[1588.28s -> 1591.72s]  And now that would be odd if an internet clown had to come and take care of you.
[1592.68s -> 1615.93s]  How do I fill up gas? Another five community subs from Adventure MF Dan. Where's the,
[1615.93s -> 1621.45s]  in an emergency vehicle, where's the gas? Wrong side? Shit, it's the wrong side. Whatever,
[1621.45s -> 1627.35s]  whatever. I don't need it right now. There's a guy lying on the ground dying. I'm going.
[1628.15s -> 1639.29s]  Had his hest. 2,045 cents for gas. That's pretty cheap. He's not dead. He's going to be fine.
[1639.29s -> 1646.81s]  Flutter is 10 community subs. Holy shit, guys. Thank you. More subs. All right, I'm here.
[1650.70s -> 1653.66s]  Look, there was no real tutorial. I'm trying to figure it out as we go.
[1654.76s -> 1662.12s]  Drive on the roads. I did too much Grand Theft Auto in my blood. Okay, I have the stretcher now.
[1664.97s -> 1670.49s]  Stretcher. Let's get it. All right, I just like causing injury to somebody else.
[1670.57s -> 1676.97s]  Phylactery, what on earth are you doing, man? Phylactery, 60 fucking nine subs. What are you
[1676.97s -> 1687.50s]  doing? Holy fuck, dude. Hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Hundreds. All right, I get a, that's a
[1687.50s -> 1694.46s]  lot of subs. 69 fucking community subs. All right, how do I put you on the stretcher? I have an
[1694.46s -> 1702.30s]  indicator, but I can't do anything about it. Jeremy, you need to buy phylactery dinner at
[1702.30s -> 1708.62s]  this point. Phylactery's bought me dinner like 6,000 times. So, I mean, all right, hold on.
[1709.91s -> 1723.70s]  This is an indicator right here. Request transport. Not ready for transport. No pulse.
[1723.70s -> 1746.62s]  CPR again? Do the defib again. Okay. All right, stop doing that. Get up. What is additional?
[1746.62s -> 1774.62s]  Traffic cones? What? Why do I have this? I'm just like playing. What a dick. Okay, all right,
[1774.62s -> 1787.70s]  all right, all right. Defib, let's go. Defib, okay. Put them back on. You've got a pulse. Why
[1787.70s -> 1792.18s]  does it say no pulse? Grab the stretcher. I already did this. Load the patient and deliver
[1792.18s -> 1807.54s]  to the hospital. Okay, okay, okay. How do I load the patient? Oh, cannot do this while the, oh,
[1807.54s -> 1815.22s]  I have to undo the connections. All right, undo these connections. All right, put this down.
[1815.86s -> 1833.90s]  So, you do have to kind of go over them. Okay, pick up. Got him. All right, let's go. Into the car.
[1834.62s -> 1856.23s]  Let's go. Into the car. Okay, let's go. Let's go. He's going. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Not into the
[1856.23s -> 1872.04s]  river. Not into the river. Okay, get in. All right, door's closed. Let's get you to the hospital.
[1872.60s -> 1883.83s]  Where's the hospital? Yeah, I know, I know. I, yes, I'm aware that we just did like a 90s comedy
[1883.83s -> 1893.54s]  routine. Yes. That, I think that happens in every single Leslie Nielsen movie. And, I mean, those
[1893.54s -> 1905.69s]  movies are legendary, but that does happen. All right, let's go back. Get your bag. I don't need
[1905.69s -> 1915.72s]  my bag. I'll get a new, I'll get a new bag. Can I skip this? Hold on. All right, that guy just hit
[1915.72s -> 1923.10s]  the ceiling of the ambulance. He went like, boom, boom. I'm not going down that stupid thing again.
[1931.99s -> 1937.37s]  I'm so glad there's no time limit because this would be so stupid. I'm not driving down that
[1937.37s -> 1964.31s]  bullshit again. There's no cars on the road. Why would I even need to have the siren? Hopefully,
[1964.31s -> 1975.30s]  this guy's bolted to the ground. All right. Where do I go? Just drop off at the front.
[1976.02s -> 2014.90s]  Okay. Get them out. Let's go in. All right. Where? Into the here. I did it. Patient delivered. All
[2014.90s -> 2029.61s]  right. That was pretty fun. Okay. See, and I got a new medical bag too. You guys were so concerned
[2029.61s -> 2045.99s]  about that. Did I miss any of the calls? All right. I have two patients hospital. Here we go. Another
[2045.99s -> 2052.26s]  vehicle incident. Uh, skip this one. All right. I'm going to fill it. I'm going to get gas.
[2052.90s -> 2070.58s]  You're wasting tax dollars. I mean, am I though? It's like seven ambulances. This is not how you
[2070.58s -> 2079.51s]  pull into a gas station. What the fuck am I doing? Where's the, um, it's right there. Okay.
[2080.31s -> 2090.14s]  Skip. I don't drive big cars guys. I'm so used to being on the, it's on my car. It's on the
[2090.14s -> 2096.94s]  right side. Okay. So that's why I, and it's like that every time. And yes, I know you have to look
[2096.94s -> 2101.66s]  every time that you have to look at your gas meter on your dashboard every time. Yeah. You do
[2101.66s -> 2115.67s]  too. Even if you've owned the car for 10 years. Okay. I got to turn the engine off. What vehicle
[2115.67s -> 2138.68s]  incident? Nah. All right. Fuel. How do I feel? Is it fueling? Is it fueling? I have to pay that
[2138.68s -> 2160.70s]  due to pay money. Vehicle incident. Nah. What was this? I've got a currency. Hey, I don't know. I'm
[2160.70s -> 2171.06s]  not sure. I do have, okay. You just, you just click it and it fills instantly. All right. I just need
[2171.06s -> 2176.50s]  to see. I'm just curious. Can I make my own incident to then bring this person to the hospital?
[2178.12s -> 2220.89s]  Don't worry. I got you. I'll take care of you. What's, what happened? What? Uh, where are you
[2220.89s -> 2228.12s]  going? You're going the wrong way. Where are you going? Hold on. You're going the wrong way. This
[2228.12s -> 2243.29s]  way. Did you fuck? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait. They can't get over here. All right. Hold on. Wait.
[2243.29s -> 2246.65s]  I have to cause a couple more injuries. This is where we test it out. This is where we test the
[2246.65s -> 2277.38s]  theory. Can steal the other ambulance. Hold on. I will. Or I'll try. All right. Ambulance on route.
[2286.97s -> 2310.57s]  Ambulance on route. Okay. Move. Move. Get out of the way. How many ambulances can I have at the same
[2310.57s -> 2339.38s]  time? Oh God. Here we go. Come here. I got you. Damn it. That's the plan. Okay. We got a new plan
[2339.38s -> 2348.20s]  here. Yeah. When the EMT gets out, run over the EMT and then call an ambulance for the EMT.
[2352.38s -> 2359.93s]  Fuck. They're immune. Damn it. They're immune to damage. No, they're immune to damage. It's not
[2359.93s -> 2375.48s]  fair. Not fair. That guy's pissed. You keep yourself in business, but they can't go anywhere.
[2376.20s -> 2401.86s]  All right. Vehicle incident. Where's the vehicle incident? It's all the way back there.
[2402.50s -> 2414.57s]  Turn your blinker off. Oh shit. You're right. I'm sorry. Another vehicle incident hit a ton. Yeah.
[2414.57s -> 2417.93s]  All right. All right. All right. We gotta, we gotta get to, we gotta get to a spawn area
[2418.49s -> 2422.09s]  because what I'm going to do is I'm going to run over like 10 people and then I'm going to get out
[2422.09s -> 2426.01s]  and I'm going to go bang, bang, bang, boom, boom, boom, boom, bum, bum, bum, calling me as ambulance,
[2426.01s -> 2437.54s]  ambulance, ambulance, ambulance, and roll. Why is my blinker still on? Turn it off. It's a guy's,
[2437.54s -> 2453.85s]  my blinker's off. Deep. I can't turn it off. It's odd. Now the other one's on. They're going to go
[2453.85s -> 2469.64s]  all the way up here again. Turn off blinker. Oh my God. It's driving me crazy now that you mentioned
[2469.64s -> 2474.79s]  it. I can't fucking believe I have to go up here again. I'm just gonna skip this one. Skip it. I
[2474.79s -> 2493.88s]  don't even want to do this one. Is it too late? You blinker fluid is too low. How do I D? How do
[2493.88s -> 2503.05s]  I like turn? I'm gonna get out of the car. Turn the engine off. Turn the engine on. Ready? Okay.
[2519.22s -> 2529.00s]  I can't turn it off. Just unplug the battery. Yeah. I know. Don't worry. That's the plan. The
[2529.00s -> 2534.30s]  plan is we're going to, we're going to hit at least 10 people and I'm going to run around and
[2534.30s -> 2539.98s]  call an ambulance for every single one of them and watch the chaos. Press three. Yeah. I mean that
[2540.62s -> 2555.43s]  look, look at the bottom of the, look at the bottom of the screen. Press the left arrow key.
[2555.43s -> 2579.67s]  That's turn. Okay. Save a little bit of time there. That noise is going to drive me fucking crazy.
[2579.67s -> 2584.31s]  It's going to drive me crazy. It really is. You're right. It's driving me crazy right now.
[2585.29s -> 2594.86s]  All right. I'm here. What happened? What an entrance. Oh, look, someone's lying on the ground.
[2595.58s -> 2618.98s]  Okay. I need the damn med bag. Just get it all out of here. All right. What's wrong? Inspect.
[2619.78s -> 2628.54s]  Head. No pulse. Okay. There's no pulse. Let's get the, uh, defib. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[2629.18s -> 2651.21s]  What are you doing? Oh, right click. Uh, hook it up. Okay. Uh, I have to, wait, what? Oh, um, hold
[2651.21s -> 2664.34s]  on. Wait, hold on. Okay. No, this is bathing suit. Okay. This is a bathing suit. All right. Um,
[2666.44s -> 2668.52s]  let's, uh, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the defib, where's the defib,
[2668.52s -> 2682.74s]  where's the defib, defib, defib, defib. I just did. Let me inspect. I didn't, I just do that.
[2684.02s -> 2695.66s]  I gotta go. Hurry up. Where's my med bag? I just teleported it. All right. Inspect. I have to
[2695.66s -> 2703.06s]  inspect every single point here. I know the possible bone fracture. Oh shit. Okay. Perform
[2703.06s -> 2724.54s]  CPR. Okay. Here we go. How do I fix the bone fracture? What do I do? Okay. Use defib. All
[2724.54s -> 2742.44s]  right. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right. One, two, three. Um, that,
[2742.44s -> 2759.98s]  that just looks like a wavelength in audacity. Uh, shock pads. Okay. Here we go. Did it work?
[2765.32s -> 2774.54s]  Do I need a fracture kit? What's a fracture kit? All right. Fracture kit. Uh, technical items,
[2774.54s -> 2783.86s]  fracture kit. Okay. Here we go. That's it. All right. Grab the stretcher for the, and uh,
[2783.86s -> 2796.12s]  deliver it. Okay. Let's go. Wait. I have to take all this stuff off. All right. Give, I needed to
[2796.12s -> 2820.02s]  get this off. Give me this. Okay. Remove. I fixed it. I'm good. Oh, I need to put cones in the road.
[2820.02s -> 2827.85s]  Oh, I got a fracture. I got a left leg fracture too. We're the same now. You and me. All right.
[2827.85s -> 2851.64s]  Here we go. Okay. No, I can't. I can't. I can't just into the water. Oh, no. Please. No.
[2867.02s -> 2890.95s]  Don't worry. I'll get you. I think she's okay. Wait, can I, I can't just go into the ocean,
[2890.95s -> 2897.51s]  right? Why can't I go? Wait. Oh, shit. Wait, wait. Contact with water? What do you mean
[2897.51s -> 2920.86s]  contact with water? Is that a tube? I think I got fired. I think the game doesn't know what to do
[2920.86s -> 2945.35s]  with me. Is a new, is a new person. Wait, she's still there? Vehicle incident. Sure. She's still
[2945.35s -> 2957.53s]  there? All right. Do you think that she is still there? Yes or no? What do you think? And can I
[2957.53s -> 2975.91s]  get her? No, no, it's definitely gonna reset. Okay. Whatever. Uh, oh yeah. Hey, this is not
[2975.99s -> 2989.90s]  a, we have two more departments to go through. Wait, what? Open. What do you want me to do?
[2990.62s -> 3006.17s]  Why do I always get stuck like this in every game? Open chat window to, to respond. What?
[3006.89s -> 3035.53s]  What do I do? Slash car 100. Is that bullshit? Type car 100 to create tonic traffic.
[3036.41s -> 3058.18s]  That didn't do anything. Slash car 100. I'm not doing it. Is it car space 100? No, it's not.
[3058.82s -> 3084.95s]  You have to get out and do it. All right. Well, good. Nice. Good one. Got me. Baited. It's not
[3084.95s -> 3105.35s]  gonna, it's not working. Oh, I think we have a fire situation here. Inspect who? What is that?
[3105.35s -> 3122.09s]  All right. What happened? Inspect. Breathing has pulse conscious possible neck injury. I know what
[3122.09s -> 3149.32s]  to do. See? Give me. Give me. Into the water you go. No, this one's not going to the water.
[3149.32s -> 3166.07s]  All right. Excuse me. That's my fucking medical bag in the way. All right. Let's go.
[3172.34s -> 3180.44s]  The ocean, the ocean. I'm not putting them in the ocean. I don't think you can actually
[3180.44s -> 3186.49s]  go in this way. All right. You're in. Close. I don't think you can fall out that way. So who cares?
[3186.49s -> 3191.03s]  I really don't think you can. Speaking of which, I'm not sure I can get back in the car.
[3196.31s -> 3212.41s]  He definitely cannot fall out that way. All right. I think we may have seen all there is to see with
[3212.41s -> 3221.26s]  the EMT. I think it's time to switch to a firefighter. Yep. It's time. It's firefighter time.
[3234.31s -> 3255.50s]  Yeah. I'm going to try. I'm going to try my bullshit one time. I've done so much weird shit
[3255.50s -> 3264.94s]  and how do I only have a... That's not that big of a deal. Minus one. All right. Let's go.
[3266.17s -> 3286.87s]  Out. Into the hospital. Let's go. Aha. Good. All right. If there's... If we have one more
[3286.87s -> 3293.48s]  opportunity here, I'm going to skip a couple and I want to get like a person fell off a tree or
[3293.48s -> 3309.67s]  something. A person fell down a hole. Is there any of those? You can choose the next mission
[3309.67s -> 3316.46s]  with a command. Oh, I left a stretcher. I don't get a new one on a new mission. I thought that
[3316.46s -> 3337.93s]  happened last time. What did I do? I just pressed N. I just skipped something. Cheat codes? All right.
[3337.93s -> 3361.91s]  Hold on. What is this? Change role. Oh, I can change role. It's that easy. Officer next.
[3362.55s -> 3382.82s]  So how much... How different is everything? Reputation, fire calls, rescue calls.
[3383.46s -> 3392.39s]  Do I have to pick up this stuff? No. What is... Select vehicle. Fire department car, ladder truck,
[3392.39s -> 3402.36s]  fire department, pumper truck. I mean, I want this one. Why would I not use that one? Building.
[3402.36s -> 3415.16s]  Okay. There's a fire. Let's go. Where's my car? Let's go. I got to put out 10 fires. All right.
[3415.16s -> 3428.57s]  Open this up. How do I open this? Uh, open the garage? Open. Oh, shit. I have to go down here.
[3428.57s -> 3452.76s]  Okay. Let's go. Uh, how do I get out of the garage? And by the way, what is this bullshit on the front?
[3454.42s -> 3461.80s]  What is this cartoon thing? They don't have that. That would be so bad for people in the...
[3461.80s -> 3465.32s]  coming the other direction, wouldn't it? Like, just... That would be ridiculous.
[3465.32s -> 3486.01s]  On top I'd just stay, but like, that's crazy. All right. Let's go. Siren doesn't do anything.
[3486.73s -> 3497.67s]  The siren doesn't do anything. All right. Here we go. Uh, the diner. How do I put out the fire?
[3497.67s -> 3503.66s]  How do I put the fire out? Oh, fire extinguisher. Right. Oh, no. Hose. Hose?
[3517.19s -> 3532.38s]  Do I have like a mask on? Uh, what do I do? Attach hose to the fire truck. Okay. Now,
[3535.94s -> 3568.39s]  is this what you do? Oh, there it is. Go in the... I gotta go in. Uh, this...
[3571.72s -> 3594.23s]  Is this... Am I doing this right? Oh, there's people. There's people in here. Where's the...
[3594.23s -> 3613.16s]  Where's the hose? Am I dead? What? What happened? Is this an ambulance coming?
[3613.16s -> 3620.42s]  How are they gonna get in here? Play as the EMT and save yourself.
[3626.26s -> 3632.87s]  Is he an EMT? Is he gonna come in the front door?
[3636.87s -> 3648.41s]  Oh, shit. Wait, what? You brought me back to life. I did it!
[3660.01s -> 3667.82s]  There comes another ambulance. I have to run out of here. The second... I have to run the fuck out
[3667.82s -> 3694.95s]  immediately. What about this person? Is this person right here okay? I have to run out. Is
[3694.95s -> 3706.25s]  the second... The second that he gets in here. There he comes. All right. Get me up. And we both
[3706.25s -> 3720.94s]  have to run out. Get... Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Okay. Good. Now, where... Is my hose still in there or not?
[3721.50s -> 3735.42s]  Okay. I need another hose. Oh, shit. I need... I don't have a hose. Uh...
[3748.87s -> 3756.39s]  Don't worry. I'm here to save the day. Oh, that's so stupid. All right. Get off.
[3756.71s -> 3767.22s]  Sneaking. Oh, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. That's dumb. How fast can I sneak?
[3769.40s -> 3777.46s]  Go on the roof. Okay. I don't think I can get on the roof. Can I get on the roof? I can get on the
[3777.46s -> 3791.42s]  roof. Holy shit. No. I need the ladder to get up there. No. No, I don't. I think I can jump over
[3791.42s -> 3808.36s]  this. I'm almost there. Come on. Okay. I'm on the roof. I've made it to the roof. What does this do
[3808.36s -> 3818.82s]  for me? Not much. Okay. Well, there's a fire. It's not just smoke. There's a fire up here.
[3819.54s -> 3838.18s]  Can the EMT get on the roof is a question that we'll have to ask. I soft-locked it? All right. I'll...
[3838.98s -> 3857.82s]  Is there a better camera? All right. Come on. Get up here. No, he doesn't get it. He doesn't get it.
[3858.62s -> 3864.33s]  Does he get it? He gets it. Hold on. I just went in the building.
[3864.81s -> 3901.11s]  I don't see him coming up. Somebody help me. Wait. What? You actually... He got me?
[3902.97s -> 3929.19s]  Holy shit. What a hero. He did it. All right. I need to... Okay. Here we go. Now put this down. I need
[3929.19s -> 3945.24s]  a... I need like a fan. All right. Give me a fan. How do I use this? How do you put the fan down?
[3945.96s -> 3952.55s]  All right. Did I put it down? I need like a mask or something. Where's like a mask?
[3953.91s -> 3963.50s]  Traffic cones. Is this thing? Okay. I got it. It's on. All right. The scuba? Okay. Now I need the...
[3964.70s -> 3973.03s]  All right. Give me a fan. Where the hell's the fan? There it is. All right. Fan is in use. Let's blow
[3973.03s -> 3998.28s]  the smoke out the... Out here. Here we go. Watch out. Move. All right. Where's the last one? Right
[3998.28s -> 4003.37s]  up here, right? Isn't it somewhere right here? It's on the outside. It's outside. Outside.
[4004.09s -> 4025.42s]  Is this working? No. This is not working. I have to get on... I might have to get on the roof. I have
[4025.42s -> 4034.78s]  to use the ladder on the roof. I gotta use the ladder on the roof. Hold on just a minute.
[4040.22s -> 4044.54s]  All right. Did you guys ever... Did your parents on Easter ever do this shit where...
[4045.82s -> 4050.62s]  For my family, each kid got a string that went around the whole house. And at the end of the
[4050.62s -> 4060.07s]  string that went all over the place was your Easter basket. That's what this was. That's what
[4060.07s -> 4105.96s]  this is. How long is this? Can I spell my name? Oh, not quite. I was trying to spell Jeremy.
[4106.84s -> 4111.24s]  I'm writing an incursive. All right. Fine. I won't write an incursive. I'll do it regular.
[4111.80s -> 4115.48s]  It's... I thought it was gonna be easier to write an incursive. All right. I won't write an incursive.
[4127.50s -> 4138.74s]  Whoa. Okay. Here's the J. Right? That's done. Now I need E. So I need to go...
[4139.70s -> 4146.17s]  It has to be connected. So we'll go to like here. It's a J. Like it's gotta be a big loop, right? E.
[4147.78s -> 4154.04s]  No. Fuck. How do you make an E? Just we do... I do all capitals. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.
[4170.10s -> 4182.50s]  Don't fuck this up. Get out of the way. Why is this so long? Why can I do this? I don't even
[4182.50s -> 4222.25s]  want to do this, but like it's available. So I'm going to do it. Fuck. Almost done. Almost done.
[4222.25s -> 4242.79s]  Relax. Relax. I have to see what it looks like. Okay. M. M is... Okay. Hold on. I gotta fix that.
[4251.83s -> 4260.71s]  That looks like shit, but it's okay. And then just Y and I'm done. And I'll go back and I'm
[4260.71s -> 4267.93s]  just going to underline it. Okay. Y needs to be straight line up and then split it right here.
[4267.93s -> 4279.27s]  Come back. Split it this way. Ah! Ah! Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4279.27s -> 4285.06s]  It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's a little messy, but it's fine. We did it. All right. There
[4285.06s -> 4302.55s]  it is. I wish I could get a big view. There's Jeremy. Okay. Cool. This thing's still going.
[4302.55s -> 4312.58s]  How can water even go through this? Ladder. Press E. What? What do you mean press E? Press E?
[4313.30s -> 4335.61s]  Why press E? I don't get it. Why press E? Press E for ladder. This is fucking ridiculous.
[4336.01s -> 4345.32s]  Imagine just driving out. This is fucking crazy. Like this is ridiculous. I don't know why you can
[4345.32s -> 4364.84s]  do this. All right. E for ladder. E. Press E. What? I can't move. Oh no. Oh, what happened?
[4364.84s -> 4389.34s]  What happened? Why is it turning into rabbit food? Oh Jesus. Why can I do this? Use ladder.
[4389.34s -> 4397.43s]  No, I can't. I don't want to. I can't. I need to move it. How do I move the ladder up and down?
[4397.99s -> 4407.70s]  The game was suffering. Is it in a trunk or something? Like fire. Fan. No. Additional.
[4408.26s -> 4430.82s]  Okay. I'm just going to spell my name real quick. J. E. I'm fucking kidding. Relax. All right. How
[4430.82s -> 4440.71s]  do I put this down? Okay. So rescue ladder. Here we go. Wait. No, no. This is like a regular ladder.
[4441.67s -> 4449.69s]  Hold on. How do I put it down? I have a huge ladder. Why would I need to put the...
[4468.74s -> 4482.97s]  All right. I made it. No, I didn't. Honestly, I don't know how to move this big ladder up and
[4482.97s -> 4494.87s]  down. Is it inside the car? Like is it in the truck? Like I have to be inside? See? No. Is it
[4494.87s -> 4518.34s]  actually on top? No, it's not. Is it? I have to actually be on it. Oh, all right. What the fuck is
[4518.34s -> 4543.29s]  this? How far can this go? Q is... Okay. Q E is up. All right. Holy shit. This is high. A little to
[4543.29s -> 4552.94s]  the right. All right. A little to the left. All right. That's where I can go. Let's go
[4554.06s -> 4563.18s]  down with it. Right here. Okay. Looks good. Press to, press to lock in the ladder. Okay.
[4563.82s -> 4574.68s]  Lock in the ladder. All right. Now I'm going to get off and I'm going to get the hose. Lock in. Okay.
[4585.96s -> 4597.66s]  Don't worry. I'm fine. All right. Let's go. I'm actually excited for this. I can't. What do you
[4597.66s -> 4607.86s]  mean I can't use this tool? Why not? How was that? What am I supposed to... Fuck. Okay. I have to
[4607.86s -> 4617.40s]  use regular ladders. Put it, put this away. Put this away. Use the other ladder to get... Oh god
[4617.40s -> 4652.30s]  dammit. Don't give me stupid ideas. Okay. That's fine. Is this thing in water? I don't understand.
[4652.30s -> 4664.18s]  No shit. How do I spin it? Mouse scroll wheel? Wait, what? Middle mouse button change adjustment.
[4664.18s -> 4677.16s]  Okay. Here we go. Good. Right there. All right. It's in perfect position. Give me the hose.
[4677.80s -> 4706.89s]  Attach it. Climb the ladder. Use the ladder. All right. Let's fucking go. I can't jump.
[4714.30s -> 4721.94s]  Hose on ladder. Put the hose on the ladder. Hose on the ladder. Hose on... Wait. I don't know what
[4721.94s -> 4726.42s]  you mean. There's a hose on the ladder. Wait. What do you mean there's a hose on the ladder?
[4727.22s -> 4737.61s]  Bring up a fire extinguisher. There's a hose on the ladder. What? What are you talking about?
[4737.61s -> 4763.42s]  There's a hose on the ladder? What do you mean apparently? It's built in. Am I even going to make
[4763.42s -> 4780.94s]  it from here? Oh my god. There is a hose on the fucking ladder. How do I use the hose? All right.
[4780.94s -> 4810.36s]  I'm gonna pull this back. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm just a giant shower. Did I do it? All right. I'm almost...
[4817.45s -> 4819.45s]  This is the stupidest thing.
[4826.65s -> 4832.84s]  So much impractical bullshit. You know what? I feel a little dirty today. I think I'm just
[4832.84s -> 4851.88s]  time for a shower. I have to get fucking rid of this. Oh no. I don't have to climb all the
[4851.88s -> 4857.26s]  way back up. I can make it. No. It's gonna have a stupid... I have a stupid fucking hose in my hands.
[4861.77s -> 4868.25s]  Just get off. Get off and fucking go up the hole. Just put this away. It's not soft locked. Put the
[4868.25s -> 4878.01s]  hose away. Put the hose... How do I just put the fucking hose away? I just want to put it away.
[4880.31s -> 4899.19s]  I want to put the hose away. Okay. Let's go. Get off. The truck is on two wheels? Is it really?
[4903.72s -> 4908.04s]  All right. All right. All right. I've had enough. Yes, I have. I've had enough. You're right. I've
[4908.04s -> 4919.83s]  had enough. It's over. It's just time to get this done. Wherever this fire is. Where is it?
[4921.74s -> 4948.12s]  There it is. Okay. There's more? Is there more? Oh, easy. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[4950.89s -> 4959.53s]  I'm just spraying the street now. Where's this other fire? Pull it back. It's gonna go up. That's
[4959.53s -> 4978.79s]  the problem. It has to go up. People are trying to drive. Okay. Seriously. Stop driving. Somebody's
[4978.79s -> 4989.21s]  in control of the actual car. Pull it back. There's a fire right there. I see it. I almost got it
[4989.21s -> 5005.91s]  right here. Yeah. There it is. There's four more fires here. Where the fuck are these other fires?
[5008.25s -> 5014.14s]  Seriously. Where are they? Are they still on the roof? Right here? There's one right there,
[5014.14s -> 5031.32s]  I think. The car is just driving without me. There's so many cars. It's all the same car.
[5032.92s -> 5056.74s]  All the same car. There's too many white vans in this universe. All right. Here we go. Am I
[5056.74s -> 5077.26s]  hitting it? No. There it is. Okay. I got it. Increased traffic. Well, how do I do it? Somebody
[5077.26s -> 5107.90s]  give me the data. One more here. Do 100 times traffic. What is it? What is it? Do slash cam
[5107.90s -> 5114.15s]  one. It was just car 100. You already did it. Yeah. That's a link with all the commands. Hold on.
[5119.30s -> 5128.01s]  All right. Commands list. Resets the vehicle. TP car. I think I have to put it in brackets.
[5130.04s -> 5133.40s]  Okay. So, yeah. So, I'm missing the bracket then. All right. Let's try it.
[5134.28s -> 5159.98s]  All right. I got to... I don't think I can open up that menu right now. Okay. Slash car 100. Slash car
[5160.94s -> 5170.23s]  five. No, guys. I don't think some of these work. Pedestrian number. Example command.
[5171.37s -> 5186.54s]  Ped five. No. I don't think these work. Maybe the console commands have to be turned on. I'm
[5186.54s -> 5189.18s]  not sure there's a thing in the menu for that. All right. Let me just do this.
[5190.14s -> 5213.42s]  Where is this? Right there. Get it. All right. Ped 100. It goes in a line one at a time.
[5214.30s -> 5228.39s]  There's only one more left. Where is it? Oh, God. Hold on. All right. We're good. We're good.
[5229.11s -> 5251.43s]  There's one more right here somewhere. We're in the edge. There it is. Jeremy, you're going to
[5251.43s -> 5255.03s]  drown people. They're going to... All the fires are out. All right. Turn this off.
[5255.75s -> 5277.56s]  What? Fire department dispatch. Did I do it? I think I did it. What happens if I collide with
[5277.56s -> 5293.72s]  myself here? All right. That's fine. All right. Get off. Get off. Container fire. Let's go.
[5294.60s -> 5311.13s]  How do I get off of this? How am I going to get out of here? Are those commands in effect right
[5311.13s -> 5319.54s]  now? They might be. Because there's a shitload of cars here right now. Can't use this. I have to
[5319.54s -> 5350.25s]  put the mask away. I put this away. Additional. I mean, get rid of my mask. Okay. It's up.
[5353.91s -> 5365.29s]  God damn it. Do ped 100. All right. Slash ped 100. I just did it. I did it. I don't know
[5365.29s -> 5380.17s]  what's going to happen, but I did it. Okay. Let's go. Where's this water even coming from?
[5382.50s -> 5389.30s]  What am I... Right. Fuck. All right. Right. Right. Right. That makes sense. That makes sense.
[5389.30s -> 5404.50s]  I just drove in a perfect spot to get stuck. I have to drive as if that's the front of the car.
[5405.30s -> 5415.22s]  Pedestrian 100. I don't see that many more pedestrians. Do you? I don't see any more
[5415.22s -> 5425.77s]  pedestrians. You're watering people. There's nobody even on the roof here.
[5425.77s -> 5446.89s]  Pedestrian 1000. I don't think that shit works. I really don't think that works.
[5449.66s -> 5483.11s]  All right. I got this one. All right. Good. Easy. All right. What's next? Anything else?
[5492.70s -> 5498.70s]  I don't know why I'm trying to chase this person to carwash them. No, this is just how they make
[5498.70s -> 5514.02s]  every Hollywood movie, guys. When it's raining out and there's a big chase scene. Give me another
[5514.02s -> 5524.15s]  call. What's going on here? All right. Building fire. You got it. It's right here. In fact,
[5524.15s -> 5528.90s]  I'm going to change this up a little bit. Give me one sec. I'm going to make this a little easier.
[5528.90s -> 5553.03s]  I have to aim the ladder in a little bit higher. So we're going to pull it up.
[5554.63s -> 5561.72s]  It's got to be like a cannon. I will do all these missions instantly. Ready? Watch this.
[5562.44s -> 5578.79s]  Okay. Then put it up and we go. Maybe a little bit higher like that. That should be good. Maybe
[5578.79s -> 5603.93s]  a little bit right there. All right. We're good. Lock it. Let's go. And then stupid blinker is on
[5603.93s -> 5619.88s]  again. Don't go under an overpass. That's right. Don't go under an overpass. Uh-huh. That's a good
[5619.88s -> 5642.92s]  call, chat. Uh-huh. Good, good call. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Body, let's get out of here. Okay, Fred. I'll fix
[5655.86s -> 5700.78s]  it. Uh, I'm just going to staple this thing. Uh-oh. Oh dear. There we go. Not so hard, is it?
[5701.34s -> 5715.26s]  Not so hard. Not so hard. All right. Now I just have to turn it a little bit more like this and
[5715.26s -> 5722.14s]  then up. Okay. Bring it down actually a little bit. Don't drive under an overpass. Don't be a
[5722.14s -> 5740.87s]  fucking idiot. I can't... Why would you have punching? All right. No overpass. I gotta go this
[5740.87s -> 5748.71s]  way. Don't... No emotion for two minutes. Why would I do that right now? I'm full of emotion at the
[5748.71s -> 5759.30s]  moment. This is a very... This is... I'm full of... I'm full of it. All right. Let's go. No overpass.
[5759.30s -> 5765.22s]  No overpass. Oh no. Overpass. Wait. I got... Okay. I guess I got miraged. I thought that was two
[5765.22s -> 5777.32s]  next to each other. I really thought there was two right next to each other. Okay. God damn it. What
[5777.32s -> 5784.57s]  the fuck? I thought they were... Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. This is where I was.
[5786.38s -> 5793.14s]  It was... The perspective was like this. Like... I was like right here. Look. I thought they were
[5793.14s -> 5799.93s]  both the same part of the road. Look. See how they're connected? Ah. So I'm like, oh shit. I
[5799.93s -> 5804.18s]  have to go all the way around. I have to go around this. He was blind as a bat. No. That's... No.
[5804.18s -> 5810.18s]  That's real. Because I actually do... If I have... If I have sound available, I can hear better.
[5810.98s -> 5815.14s]  I would get... Fucking idiot. I can see better if I can hear what's happening.
[5819.77s -> 5836.95s]  I think... Okay. I'm... I might be fucked here. Can I push it back on? I think I'm fucked. Yep.
[5836.95s -> 5846.84s]  All right. We're going to do something drastic. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I feel
[5846.84s -> 5850.68s]  like I'm not even trying to do this. You know what I mean? Like I'm... I can't... You get stuck on a
[5850.68s -> 5895.48s]  curve. Ugh. All right. Here we go. Okay. Done. Pull it in. All right. I don't know if it's just me,
[5895.48s -> 5899.32s]  but it's like the running water is starting to give me anxiety. Is anyone getting anxiety
[5899.32s -> 5910.39s]  from this water being on the whole time? I kind of am. All right. Let's go. All right. See? Look.
[5910.39s -> 5927.93s]  Ugh. All right. We're good. Right there. The diner is on fire again. It's the same diner.
[5927.93s -> 5934.02s]  All right. Are we in the right spot? Kind of. I don't want to do this... I don't want to put
[5934.02s -> 5951.00s]  this out again. This is... This is the same one. I don't want to do this one again. Why is there a
[5951.08s -> 5967.11s]  chainsaw? Okay. Water hose. Let's go attach it. Here we go. Get in. Fires. Where are they?
[5969.46s -> 5972.66s]  And I... What? I want to rescue these people this time. Actually rescue.
[5973.38s -> 5985.62s]  Is it just the top of the building that's on fire? Oh, come on. Really? What about this side? All
[5985.62s -> 6012.95s]  right. This right here. You're cleaning the windows. No, I'm trying... It is outside. I was right.
[6013.91s -> 6032.60s]  I was right. I was right. I was right. I was right. So what the fuck? Let me know water supply.
[6032.60s -> 6044.23s]  Did I use it all? Dude, get out of the way. Move. Oh my God. You drive me fucking crazy. Get out of
[6044.23s -> 6067.99s]  the way. Move. Chainsaw. Hydrant. All right. Hydrant. That's not how this works. Water supply
[6067.99s -> 6097.11s]  hose. Okay. Now water hose. All right. Let's go. All right. Is there any of the jobs to do besides
[6097.11s -> 6113.14s]  just spray the same building over and over again? Forspawn them with cheats. Cheats don't really
[6113.14s -> 6124.92s]  work. I haven't been able to get them to work. These fires are in like some strange places.
[6125.88s -> 6137.58s]  Drive. What? Yeah. What does someone have the cheats? That's not that. Where is this fire?
[6139.22s -> 6152.39s]  Where's this fire? I can see it, but I can't hit it. Right there. I'm... I know it's right here,
[6152.39s -> 6181.50s]  but what the hell is going on? All right. Let me look at the cheats. I want to spawn... I want
[6181.50s -> 6189.32s]  to spawn a different mission. Okay. So a command to force the next mission is set. It does not
[6189.32s -> 6201.19s]  force the call. It will appear still at random. Cannot be the same twice in a row. Okay. So next
[6201.19s -> 6212.12s]  mission underscore ID equals... Oh, no. Underscore ID. Next mission underscore ID. No, no. Just
[6212.12s -> 6222.81s]  next mission underscore aggressive driver. This is police. Okay. Fire. Container fire. Building
[6222.81s -> 6232.82s]  fire. Vehicle fire. Driver trap. Driver trapped. Cat in a tree. Cat in a tree? Okay. That's kind
[6232.82s -> 6254.66s]  of cool. Let's try to do that. Cat in a tree is 2,000. I wonder if it's going to work. Try M
[6254.66s -> 6269.06s]  cancel. M... What was it? M cancel? Dash cancel? Oh, shit. It does work. All right. So the cheats do
[6269.06s -> 6289.99s]  kind of work. Vehicle fire. No, skip. All right. Let's do cat. Cat. I want a new one of these. I
[6289.99s -> 6310.57s]  don't want this anymore. What else we got? Oh, cat stuck in a tree. There it is. Boys and girls,
[6310.57s -> 6316.49s]  cat stuck in a tree. Freddy Dredd just dropped a fucking hundred subs. What? Freddy. Holy fuck,
[6316.49s -> 6329.75s]  Freddy. Freddy coming in hot again with 100. And they're... They are... Oh, boy. That's a...
[6331.06s -> 6343.19s]  That is 100 tier 2 subs. That's tier 2. That's a lot. That's a lot of money.
[6343.91s -> 6358.17s]  Tier 2. And the thing is, I don't even have any tier 2 stuff. Holy shit, Freddy. That is
[6358.17s -> 6369.66s]  even more to the ridiculous amount of fucking money that you've given this stream. Post the
[6369.74s -> 6378.58s]  golden beer. I'm not even sure... Is that still for 10 bucks? Where's my... I'm trapped. Hold on.
[6384.66s -> 6391.86s]  I need to get in that building. So I do have... No, I don't. Isn't that... That's a regular one,
[6391.86s -> 6398.10s]  isn't it? All right. How do I get into the fire department? Time for you to upgrade. There it is.
[6400.73s -> 6405.77s]  Okay. Cat stuck in a tree. I want to spawn just a regular vehicle. Nothing insane. We're going to
[6405.77s -> 6415.99s]  heal. $1,000 in one draw. Yeah, that's fucking crazy. Freddy, I can't thank you enough. That's
[6415.99s -> 6424.50s]  ridiculous. All right. We're just going to do fire department carb one. Or... No, let's do the...
[6427.86s -> 6444.42s]  Should we do every children's toy? Yeah. Honestly, the cat was up in that tree the whole time.
[6444.42s -> 6453.22s]  Phylactery. And not to be overshadowed. Phylactery with another 75. So... 75. 69. 75 stuck in my brain.
[6456.42s -> 6468.92s]  You guys. Seriously. Holy fuck. All right. Let me put... Phylactery. Thanks for the 69 fucking subs.
[6469.56s -> 6477.45s]  Let's go save a cat. We're going to start to be compound subbing. People are going to be
[6477.45s -> 6481.37s]  subbed two different times. People are going to get tier... Can you get tier one and tier two at
[6481.37s -> 6496.02s]  the same time? Holy shit. But seriously, both of you and anybody that subs this channel. We
[6496.02s -> 6501.14s]  talked about it on the New Year's Eve stream, but there's been so much support on this channel.
[6502.57s -> 6517.85s]  I just... I'm fucking flabbergasted. All right. How do I get the cat out of the tree? Do I have to
[6517.85s -> 6532.98s]  climb the tree with my hands? Where is the cat? I don't see a cat. No cat to return. Ladder. Climb
[6532.98s -> 6542.81s]  to... Okay. Cut the tree down. Wait. What? Hold on. Cut the tree down. They don't do this. Don't they
[6542.81s -> 6584.20s]  go up? What? What do you mean cut the tree down? Okay. Here's your... Thank you for calling the
[6584.20s -> 6594.86s]  fire department. Appreciate it. Have a good rest of your day. Oh my God. Okay. Can we do... I want
[6594.86s -> 6601.48s]  to do the cat. I want to do the cat stuck in the tree again. These are fun. These ones are good.
[6603.03s -> 6620.22s]  Okay. I want to actually fire... Building fire. No. Skip. I want to actually go climb the tree. I
[6620.22s -> 6634.44s]  didn't know you could even do that. He's stalling? What? Who's... Oh, this person's in the way.
[6634.44s -> 6647.98s]  He's stalling. No, I want to see the rest of the... I want to see the... You want to see stalling? I'll
[6647.98s -> 6673.75s]  show you fucking stalling. You really want to see what stalling looks like? Sure. What happened?
[6673.75s -> 6692.36s]  We should go... Oh, never mind. All right. Cat a tree. Let's go. Oh, I'm not doing it right. Cat
[6692.36s -> 6709.53s]  stuck in a tree. Okay. Is it her? Let's just... This time just run the tree over with your truck.
[6710.81s -> 6728.95s]  Oh, that's so loud. Stop. Get away from me. You're putting on a siren for a cat. Yeah, this is an
[6728.95s -> 6733.75s]  emergency. What if the cat like fell? But what if somebody cut the tree down with the chainsaw?
[6734.71s -> 6760.62s]  I gotta be prepared. I gotta be ready. I think I can do it. No. No. No. Don't. Don't. Don't. I think
[6760.62s -> 6771.82s]  I can do it. I really think it's possible. I do. All right. So it's not possible. Fuck it. Whatever.
[6771.82s -> 6775.66s]  You were right. I was wrong. I was wrong. You were right. I was wrong. You were right. And I will
[6775.66s -> 6781.26s]  admit that. That's fine. I thought that it was possible that I could go up and over. I might be
[6781.26s -> 6791.80s]  able to, but okay. Fine. No, you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. It's good to
[6791.80s -> 6807.45s]  try. You gotta try at least once. I hate going up here. Oh, that's right. There is still police
[6807.45s -> 6837.96s]  missions to do. What is that? Why do you have the Hollywood Hills place from GTA 5 here? And there's
[6837.96s -> 6859.10s]  always missions over here. All right. There's the tree. Let's go. Enough bullshit. I'm climbing up
[6859.10s -> 6868.74s]  there and I'm going to get the cat myself. There we are. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. I have
[6869.24s -> 6884.31s]  to go all the way around. Don't even think about it. You're going to get stuck. Okay. I'm here.
[6888.34s -> 6901.08s]  Cat's stuck in a tree. All right. What seems to be the problem? Found the cat. All right. Cat right
[6901.08s -> 6926.73s]  here. Give me the ladder. All right. Rescue. Ladder. Looks good. I'm going up. Come here.
[6926.73s -> 6945.78s]  There you are. Got you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit. I was going to...
[6946.66s -> 6953.82s]  You were going to be my partner. No, I was going to put you in like the front seat and it was
[6953.82s -> 6968.17s]  going to be like a funny movie, like a Disney movie. Stop. Come here. Save. I saved the cat.
[6968.17s -> 6999.14s]  Who cares? That's two failed cats. That's two rescued cats, actually. There's another cat?
[7000.02s -> 7012.07s]  Why is there another cat in the tree? You have two cats. Okay. Well, you have two cats.
[7012.07s -> 7020.63s]  Probably you're doing business with you. All right. Let's go. You didn't have clearance to do that?
[7023.83s -> 7033.46s]  It was violating... She was violating her neighbor's yard. Vehicle fire. No. All right.
[7034.46s -> 7040.86s]  What's any other good ones for fire? Driver trapped? All right. How about driver trapped?
[7040.86s -> 7061.38s]  We'll try this one. I don't know. 18. Oh, here comes the cliff joke. All right. Okay. Let's
[7061.38s -> 7069.08s]  do... I want to see driver trapped and then we'll do police. I promise. Vehicle incident. No. That's
[7069.08s -> 7080.02s]  not it. 18. I'm going to stay up here for a second because just in case it's up here.
[7080.02s -> 7095.66s]  I'm not doing this again. Wait, that was it? I thought that was a... Oh, that was it. You monster.
[7095.66s -> 7100.14s]  All right. I thought it was vehicle. I thought it was like vehicle incident, not like driver.
[7100.14s -> 7105.72s]  I don't know. We've seen like a bunch of vehicle incidents in the same thing. Building fire. No.
[7106.52s -> 7131.62s]  Okay. Let's do it. And then it was 18. Come on. Drive that guy off the road. I'm not going to do
[7131.62s -> 7145.53s]  that. Come on. Let's go. All right. Driver trapped. Yes. Where is it? I knew I should have stayed
[7145.53s -> 7153.80s]  here. Right? See? I told you. Wait, where is that? No, that's really far away. Is this a beach in
[7153.80s -> 7160.42s]  this game? This place... Why is everything in this same... This is a huge map. Jesus. This is actually
[7160.42s -> 7174.38s]  a giant map. Like that was not meant to be a joke. I'm serious. Like that was just quicker to get
[7174.38s -> 7182.15s]  down here. That's not... Oh, look at me. I'm jumping off a cliff. No, that's... I'm just trying
[7182.15s -> 7205.77s]  to get here fast. Minus one. Yeah, I know. That's fine. You can do that. Explaining the joke doesn't
[7205.77s -> 7227.86s]  make it funny. It would have taken me so much time. Wrong way. I know. I... This is how I drive in
[7228.50s -> 7235.14s]  I'm telling you. I'm sorry. It happens every single time I play any game. I drive on the other side
[7235.14s -> 7240.74s]  of the road. Something about it is easier for my brain to understand. In a video game. Like I drive
[7240.74s -> 7250.26s]  my car every fucking day. Let's be realistic here. I don't... I don't know why. And I missed the turn
[7250.26s -> 7257.82s]  because I'm sitting here just yapping. I can't even go over the medium. I have to turn around.
[7260.78s -> 7270.97s]  I have to turn around. God damn it. I gotta spin this car around. Admit it. You have a butler drive
[7270.97s -> 7291.99s]  you places. I don't have a butler. Get the fuck over here. I gotta go... Who put these cones in?
[7291.99s -> 7296.71s]  There's not even any construction. Fuck. No. Why does this have to keep happening to me?
[7297.75s -> 7301.35s]  I can't even... Why does this have to happen to me? This keeps happening to me.
[7302.23s -> 7305.67s]  When things like this keep happening to you, you're the problem. You know what I mean? Like
[7305.67s -> 7312.54s]  I'm the problem here. This... Oh wait. Why did I get stuck here? When it happens every time,
[7312.54s -> 7334.23s]  the problem I think is probably you. You know? It's me. All right. Fuck off with this. He's driving
[7334.23s -> 7340.47s]  on the wrong side of the road and he finally... He says maybe I'm the problem. Not right there.
[7341.19s -> 7354.78s]  I was driving normally there. Is this a Sim City highway? And these carriages all over the place,
[7354.78s -> 7361.14s]  aren't they? All right. Vehicle... Vehicle incident. Here we are. What's the problem?
[7370.30s -> 7395.24s]  I don't know. Somebody's... Who's trapped? Oh, okay. What is it called? A spreader? This just looks
[7395.24s -> 7427.24s]  like a camel spider. Okay. How do I get it in? Now what? Okay. Got it. How do I put this... All right.
[7427.24s -> 7436.02s]  Now get him out. What? Do I have to pull him out? Why do I have to pull him out? Aren't you an EMT?
[7436.02s -> 7445.94s]  Where'd you get that cool EMT outfit? Interact using medbag. That's you. That's this person's
[7445.94s -> 7477.58s]  job. I don't have a medbag. What? Yeah. Wait. Hold on. I have to do this? Breathing. Conscious.
[7477.58s -> 7495.11s]  Possible neck injury. Yeah. I got you. Wait. What did that say? Okay. Do CPR? I don't think I can do
[7495.11s -> 7505.45s]  CPR while he's inside of the car. You can't perform CPR on this person. Can't use this.
[7506.17s -> 7538.14s]  How do I do CPR? What's this guy doing? Why is he doing like mime work? Tree blocking road. I'll take
[7538.14s -> 7565.27s]  it. I can't move. Okay. There we go. All right. No, no, no. Time to... I want to be a police officer.
[7565.27s -> 7570.36s]  Did you just get in my car? What the fuck? No. All right. I want to be a police officer. Let's go.
[7570.36s -> 7621.10s]  And then we can move on. I'm interested though. How do I TP? TP slash HQ. Here we go. All right.
[7621.10s -> 7653.29s]  Let's go to the police department. He's cheating? Yes. Sorry. I'm cheating in flashing lights. Is
[7653.29s -> 7661.16s]  there a single game that you don't cheat in? Wait. Why is everybody so concerned about me teleporting?
[7664.78s -> 7679.86s]  I'm just TP. I'm not using cheats right now. All right. Here we go. Wait. Okay. Change to police.
[7684.79s -> 7714.42s]  Okay. Let's do tall guy. Hat. And shades. No. Wait. I'm going to get VAC banned. Office of Jecks.
[7714.42s -> 7721.38s]  This isn't supposed to be a fantasy game. Yes it is. Because it's something I'm not doing in real
[7721.38s -> 7727.11s]  life. All right. What's here? What's going on here? Register suspect. All right. Select vehicle. What
[7727.11s -> 7742.47s]  do I want for a car? Police car. Police car. This one. Get the tank. Oh, there it goes. Armed robbery
[7742.47s -> 7768.30s]  in progress. Let's go. It's in progress right now. Like right here. This car is fast. Really fast
[7768.30s -> 7776.52s]  actually. All right. Armed robbery. Here we go. How do you arrest people? Oh no. Armed robbery at
[7776.52s -> 7782.36s]  the diner. This diner. It would suck to be somebody that worked. They're shooting at me? It's the same
[7782.36s -> 7801.85s]  dot. How do I use a gun? All right. Wait. Wait. Trunk. Weapon two. What? I don't know. People are
[7801.85s -> 7819.78s]  running at me. I don't know. Why do you have a fan in here? What? Wait. Can I get revived by a BMT?
[7823.37s -> 7838.62s]  Wait. Suspect on foot. Suspect on foot. Suspect on foot. Quick. Get me. Get me. Get me. Get me. Get
[7838.62s -> 7843.59s]  me. Get me up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Revive me. Come on. Don't let her get away. Don't let her get away.
[7843.59s -> 7848.74s]  She's not getting away. She ain't getting away. Revive me. Why is there a fan in here? What are
[7848.74s -> 7858.66s]  they doing? Let's go. Come on. They're gonna get away. I have to arrest them. How do I say like
[7858.66s -> 7887.37s]  you're under arrest? Am I not gonna be... Am I dead? Permanently. What just happened? Come on.
[7887.37s -> 7893.16s]  Give me like ten. I think they're fucked up. All right. I have to respawn at the station.
[7895.50s -> 7902.97s]  I can't. The whole thing is fucked up actually. Yeah. It's all fucked up. I can't. R is not doing
[7902.97s -> 7920.54s]  anything anymore. I'm gonna TP. All right. TP. TP HQ. The suspect is coming back. What?
[7923.26s -> 7931.35s]  Dead body TP. Is the suspect gonna come back into the diner? Shit. Okay. How do I like... Is there
[7931.35s -> 7959.74s]  any like force... They're coming back down here. Somebody stop that person. Okay. I'm dead. Oh,
[7959.74s -> 7964.68s]  it's over. Is there like a force reset or something? What is it? How do I like force
[7964.68s -> 7980.23s]  reset? There's gotta be something here. Car. Reset. The resets vehicle. Cancels mission.
[7981.11s -> 7998.70s]  All right. So M cancel. Let's try M cancel. Okay. And then V reset. Can I fucking come back to life?
[7998.70s -> 8022.97s]  There's a fight going on in progress. No. God damn it. Come on. Wait. Where's the fight? There's a
[8022.97s -> 8030.92s]  fight in progress? Where's the fight? All right. Come on. Robot. Oh boy. All right. All right. I
[8030.92s -> 8034.28s]  gotta... I can't even hit escape. I'm gonna reset the game. I'm just gonna reset the game. Give me

[8046.01s -> 8050.46s]  It's all good. I'm coming right back. That was only one mission. That's not fair.
[8051.78s -> 8062.36s]  Coming back. Here we are. Why is my car flipped? It's because I spawned it in front of me or
[8062.36s -> 8070.71s]  something weird. I have no idea. Okay. Let's go. You want this as high as possible. 99.
[8071.83s -> 8076.39s]  99. Don't matter. Parked vehicle density. Medium. Time of day. Fuel consumption. Who cares?
[8081.70s -> 8085.30s]  Don't read this. I don't know. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna read the rest of that. Whatever it was.
[8086.18s -> 8094.58s]  Have I ever played city skylines? I have never played city skylines and I've never played sim
[8094.58s -> 8105.75s]  city. I have no idea. I've seen random stuff. I feel like I'm too stupid to play it.
[8114.07s -> 8117.75s]  You're not. I feel like it's too. I have to learn a lot and I'm not. I'm too
[8118.63s -> 8123.83s]  all over the place to be able to learn it correctly. He played sim city on DOS and it was a disaster
[8123.83s -> 8127.43s]  and I played it for like 15 minutes and realized I was not going to be able to. I was incapable.
[8128.31s -> 8138.04s]  City skylines is easy. All right. Well, put it on the list. I have 60 PC games and Wii games and
[8138.04s -> 8147.11s]  and GameCube games and PS2 games. I've got so many games. You have no idea. All right. Let's go.

[8223.00s -> 8228.36s]  Block the car. Ram it or use spike strips? Am I supposed to use spike? I think I could go in front
[8228.36s -> 8257.14s]  of them. I could go in front of them and do spike strips. Where are they? This person wasn't even
[8257.14s -> 8268.09s]  aggressive. They were driving normally. You were driving normal. All right. Get out of the car.
[8269.05s -> 8279.54s]  Out. Get out of the car. All right. Out. Get out of the car. Driving recklessly. Get out of the car.

[8400.44s -> 8408.28s]  that? Why can you do that? Why can you do that? You should not be able to do that
[8409.72s -> 8419.72s]  as a police officer. Why are they in the trunk? Okay. What? Why is this still on the list?
[8423.62s -> 8435.43s]  Block the car? Oh my god. Why? Hold on a minute. I am so confused. I can't believe you can do this.

[9138.36s -> 9145.05s]  following me. Where are they going? Where are they going? You're supposed to be following me
[9145.05s -> 9156.84s]  and instead you're trying to run away? No. Okay. Remember, if you see a bald guy, they have to join
[9156.84s -> 9168.31s]  the group. I'm gonna Agent Smith the fuck out of this. All right, let's go. I think they're too
[9168.31s -> 9181.58s]  stupid. All right, whatever. They don't move that fast. Can I even punch anybody? Punching doesn't

[10128.81s -> 10147.26s]  It's hard to turn. It's just the GTA five map. Is it really? No, it's not.
[10149.80s -> 10163.26s]  Is it? I'm confused. Is it really? All right. Is it, was this fight fight in progress? All right.

[10754.55s -> 10765.45s]  Watch out. All right. I think I've seen everything I can see in this game. This is pretty,
[10765.45s -> 10779.16s]  pretty interesting. Has to be from the other side. No, it does not. No. See, it's not doing anything.
[10784.54s -> 10797.43s]  All right. Let me go to the bathroom. I'll figure out what we're going to do. Some nice cars.
