[20.02s -> 29.02s]  Not that late, a little bit late. I just wanted to do a last minute check. I had to take auto out
[29.02s -> 33.82s]  and then I wanted to make sure these are all... I messed up the way the images came through,
[34.38s -> 41.74s]  so I had to re kind of put them in the right place. But we're live now. How are you? Good afternoon.
[42.62s -> 50.38s]  It is currently 2 1 2 Pacific. I don't know what time it is for you, but hopefully it's in a nice
[50.38s -> 60.63s]  time. Omega lull. Right off the bat, already got a couple of omega lulls. It's gonna be a good one
[60.63s -> 67.86s]  tonight! Uh yeah, we're gonna do a community content night. My throat's a little scratchy
[68.58s -> 79.27s]  because I've had a cold, but I've had a 20% cold for like 10 days. It won't become a cold,
[79.91s -> 91.96s]  but it won't stop. It won't leave me alone. Maybe it's the air. I started to develop this after the
[91.96s -> 97.78s]  slime stream. It's just like, get at it! Like give me the cold and let's get it over with.
[101.30s -> 116.54s]  He's turning. Not yet. Not yet. We'll see. You got slime-itis. No, but uh again, this is the second
[116.54s -> 125.53s]  time we're gonna be doing this. Expect this stream to be somewhere around a few hours, three or four
[125.53s -> 128.97s]  hours. This is what we're doing. Community content only. If you don't know what that is, go to the
[128.97s -> 134.42s]  discord. Read the pin on the community content discord page. You can find out what we're doing.
[136.31s -> 146.15s]  Art, videos, music, community themed. There were a lot of submissions. Tried to go through and get
[146.15s -> 158.74s]  as many as I could in for today. All right, so let's go ahead and move over here. We're just
[158.74s -> 166.07s]  gonna get started. Yeah, there's gonna be a cam today. I promise. There you go. You ready?
[167.61s -> 178.73s]  Um, there'll be a camera today. I didn't say which one though. This is the first one. This is the
[178.73s -> 183.29s]  first- we're gonna start with images. I don't know what the- I- is that pic- I don't know if
[183.29s -> 195.14s]  that's pixel me, but here's real me. How are you? Good afternoon. Uh, so make that face. I did that
[195.14s -> 200.66s]  face again. I'm never making that face again. I've done that face twice and it has become
[201.98s -> 209.11s]  just- there's a worse one. I look like it's gross in this picture too. I've talked about how this
[209.11s -> 220.04s]  is my least favorite photo a dozen times. Do it. Do it. No, the- the greedy grinner is not worse
[220.04s -> 225.00s]  than this. I'm gonna have to put like the evidence forward. This is the worst picture that exists of
[225.00s -> 236.17s]  me with like more than a hundred upvotes, but this is the one we're starting with. Derma face tier
[236.17s -> 241.78s]  list. I can't do that. Hold on. Let me just- everybody thinks I'm gross before drinking, like
[241.78s -> 251.35s]  I put blood in water, whatever. Uh, all right, let's get- let's go. This is number one. Again,
[251.35s -> 257.48s]  I want to make this very clear. Make sure you watermark your images. It's got to be on Imgur
[257.48s -> 261.98s]  and- or it's got to be on YouTube. Make- put- you got to put a little thing down here
[261.98s -> 271.26s]  that says like, Dan, you know, what- I do- whoever you are. What? What did I say? Imgur.
[271.26s -> 279.42s]  Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry, folks. Imgur. Imgur. That's too many things to say.
[280.06s -> 289.56s]  Imgur. No. Imgur. It's so much easier. Even if it's wrong, I'm still gonna do it. There are people
[289.56s -> 301.56s]  that say jup instead of jup. So, am I gonna change those people's minds? No. I say Imgur.
[301.56s -> 306.60s]  Fuck dumbass shithead. Oh my god. All right, let's take a look at the next- I gotta get this image
[306.60s -> 310.20s]  off the screen before it's like, again, the number one thing that comes up when you type in Derma
[310.20s -> 318.18s]  into any search. That's what it is. All right, this is the next image coming up. Fireman. Look
[318.18s -> 323.96s]  at this dude. Everybody loves Fireman. Of all the things, like, everybody just loves this character.
[326.10s -> 339.62s]  This is one of quite a few good Firemans tonight. He's awesome. Look at this dude. Very good
[339.62s -> 349.82s]  Fireman. I like the little rosy cheeks here. It's a nice touch. And I make that face. I do this all
[349.82s -> 355.16s]  the time. I always have this little, like, shit-eating grin on. I just did it right there.
[356.87s -> 367.66s]  Shito. I think we may have seen this one already, but it's still very good. Rest in peace,
[367.66s -> 379.42s]  Shito. What's wrong with Shito? Shito's batteries are dead, but that's all right. How do you zoom?
[379.42s -> 386.62s]  It's control plus, right? There we go. Shito's batteries are dead, but here's the thing about
[387.74s -> 395.94s]  inanimate objects. If you put new batteries in, they just wake up. It's like going under anesthesia.
[396.58s -> 401.99s]  They just get up. They're just up now. And they keep all their memories. Everything's fine.
[403.69s -> 407.13s]  Shito could sit in, like, a suitcase for, like, 10 years, and I just put batteries in, and it's
[407.13s -> 411.61s]  just like he opens his eyes from the last time he was turned off. And he's like, I'm fine. I'm
[411.61s -> 425.10s]  alive. I'm fine. Wake him up. Maybe one day. That's Toy Story 5. What a great idea for a Toy Story
[425.10s -> 437.59s]  sequel. That's fantastic. Have Woody just wake up in, like, 2060, and he has to deal with the
[437.59s -> 441.43s]  future, and he just, hey, all of his memories are from, you could do a whole future thing with that.
[444.38s -> 447.58s]  His batteries died. Yeah, that would be perfect. I would go see that movie.
[448.30s -> 456.73s]  The Wall-E future? No, it just had to be, like, a regular future. Not the Wall-E future. We're not
[456.73s -> 461.91s]  going to get, guys, we're not going to get that advanced. We've plateaued, I think, in a lot of
[461.91s -> 466.15s]  technology. It's going to take, like, a hundred more years before we get, like, a real new, like,
[466.15s -> 475.21s]  plateau of technology. I disagree. All right, let's keep going. That was Shito. Good. They watermarked.
[476.01s -> 493.32s]  I mean, it, that's me. That is me. Although I don't know if my, like, jaw is that. Maybe it was.
[494.04s -> 503.85s]  When I look at some of these images, I just go, like, is that, like, that's me? Man, I guess I
[503.85s -> 510.06s]  look like that, huh? That's a great style, though. I love, you know what I like about this one?
[511.10s -> 520.06s]  This part, right down here. I love this, this shadow. This, like, neon shadow. I love what you
[520.06s -> 524.86s]  do with the chin, because that's the extent of the amount of hair that I can grow on my face.
[525.58s -> 534.97s]  You nailed it. I don't have enough gamer neck. I don't, what do you mean gamer? I don't need gamer
[534.97s -> 541.18s]  neck for this. I can sit like that. And that's what my, look at my throat. That's what my throat
[541.18s -> 549.72s]  looks like, too. Like, bumpy and fucked up looking. I am, okay, I am such a bumpy person.
[551.08s -> 554.60s]  Like, what you see right here is what it looks like the whole way down. I'm just, like,
[554.60s -> 560.86s]  covered in, like, little, like, bumps and, like, loose skin. I do not look good naked.
[564.60s -> 573.46s]  No, I'm not kidding. Yeah, I do. No, not like a toad. Maybe it is kind of, no, it is like a toad.
[574.87s -> 579.91s]  No, it's not. Let's find out. Okay, what if I show you, okay, is it, no, that's illegal. I can't do
[579.91s -> 587.59s]  that. Just like, let me show you. That would be really bad. What do you think about this?
[588.89s -> 599.35s]  Illegal. No, I'm really, like, bumpy and, like, coarse. Like, when you touch my arm, it's like
[599.35s -> 609.53s]  sandpaper. It's like, ah, fuck, that's like, that's rough. I like this image a lot. It's very good.
[610.09s -> 617.03s]  Very, very good. Give me the watermark. Streamer go, well, there it is. Streamer goes insane.
[617.91s -> 631.98s]  I like this one here. I don't even, I don't even have to do anything. It's already there. Look at
[631.98s -> 646.14s]  that, like, in my stomach line, too. That is what it looks like. What is that? The old toothbrush,
[646.14s -> 654.78s]  I remember this one. That, like, that's the fart face? This, ah, this is the fart face, isn't it?
[655.42s -> 661.38s]  And of course, being bagsonic, I like the blue and the blue. That ties the whole thing together.
[661.38s -> 664.90s]  They pop, and then you add a little bit of, a little bit of green over here,
[665.94s -> 670.26s]  which your eye goes like this. This is how this works, guys. Trust me, I know how to, I know art.
[670.98s -> 676.82s]  Your eye, the artist decided to put the colors, pop it out like this, so your eye goes like this.
[676.82s -> 681.06s]  See what I just did? Oh, bang, bang, bang, bang, right there. Bang, bang, bang, bang, right there.
[682.02s -> 693.72s]  Your eye is one, two, three, four points across the paper. Don't you ask the artist. See?
[695.08s -> 699.99s]  Like, they're here right now? Yeah, that's why I did that. It's a good composition. I like it.
[700.63s -> 704.47s]  Very good. A lot of, a lot of moments. A lot of, like, a Twitter picture.
[705.83s -> 716.39s]  I don't think that, that many people are gonna like that photo, but they did. Your chin's not big
[716.39s -> 723.69s]  enough. It's huge right here. Like, my nose is, is, like, right outside, and then my chin, like,
[723.77s -> 728.97s]  touches the top of my nose, like, per minute. If you took a ruler and go like this, it'll hit
[728.97s -> 739.93s]  the bottom of my chin. See? Because it comes out. I fart like a banana. There isn't a ruler long
[739.93s -> 753.24s]  enough. Get out of here. Rude. All right, there's a, there's a, look, wait for this one. Ready?
[754.52s -> 765.37s]  So, this is, just watch it. Ready? Let's add the bottom teeth. Two submissions here. One,
[766.09s -> 773.19s]  one of the top row, and then finishing it with the bottom row. You gotta complete the photo.
[774.92s -> 784.78s]  My teeth aren't like that. Imagine you had teeth like that. Your mouth would just be constantly
[784.78s -> 790.63s]  bleeding. Blood would just be pouring out of your mouth at all times. It would just be like, ah!
[792.33s -> 796.17s]  Blood would just be filling your mouth, and you'd just have to spit. You'd have to carry,
[796.17s -> 800.65s]  like, you'd have to carry one of these around, and like, you just wouldn't, you'd have to keep
[800.65s -> 813.61s]  your mouth closed like this, and talk through here. Otherwise, you'd just get hurt. Blood bottle.
[814.17s -> 820.82s]  It's tea. It's tea. I'm drinking tea. But no, that's, I like these two because you,
[820.82s -> 825.06s]  the second submission has the bottom teeth. It's like, oh, fuck! I forgot to, I forgot the bottom
[825.06s -> 833.85s]  row of teeth! All right, I got, I got it now. It's there now. Let's keep going. This is when I won
[833.85s -> 843.94s]  the vine wrestle. It's the belt right there. You'd have to wear a mouth guard. Yeah, you just have to
[843.94s -> 853.78s]  have like a constant mouth guard on. CM Jerem. That was a lot of fun. I was happy to participate.
[853.78s -> 865.54s]  It was a great day. This is glue man. Who is this? What, what actual character is this? I don't,
[865.54s -> 873.50s]  I don't know who that is. What's the actual wrestler? It's glue man. No, behind the mask.
[876.20s -> 885.86s]  It's the dude, it's just a dude next to CM Punk. That's not a wrestler. This is like a fan. Wait,
[885.86s -> 890.26s]  is this somebody just getting in the photo? Like, leaning in? How would they be here?
[893.05s -> 902.71s]  They were just in the crowd. Oh, I thought this is like two wrestlers. Whatever. Oh wait, this is
[902.71s -> 906.87s]  awesome! I forgot this is like the Jupiter Storm. I should have, bye, I didn't, I wouldn't. Let's
[906.87s -> 915.37s]  just sit here for a minute. This is great. So this is a Jupiter Storm. Really a little screen saver.
[915.37s -> 921.11s]  I think it's great. You know what would be really awesome is if whoever made this, whoever programmed
[921.11s -> 928.55s]  this, to make it so it would count the Jupiters that are happening in chat. How many completed
[928.55s -> 934.39s]  ones happened? And that's the ones that ran down. That would be awesome. Oh, there's also gnomes
[934.39s -> 943.85s]  here, but who cares about those? We can remove those. Chat is feeding them back to the sky.
[946.71s -> 952.22s]  But yeah, this is really cool. It's just like a little screen saver. I think it's random too.
[953.32s -> 959.10s]  Seems like it is. Let's see. Is it random? They're just kind of, yeah, I think it is.
[959.66s -> 966.63s]  Different distances and stuff. No, it's not. Are you sure? I don't know about that. Let's see if
[966.63s -> 972.47s]  that happens again. No, it is absolutely just whatever, wherever they go. See? Look at that.
[973.19s -> 977.78s]  Here they come. See? They go down and then at the bottom and then they start at the top.
[978.73s -> 985.22s]  Watch the gnomes. Why do I feel like if I sit here for long enough, it's going to scream at me.
[989.35s -> 997.06s]  I don't think it is. It's just going to go like boop. It's really cool though.
[1000.30s -> 1007.30s]  This is a photo of a photo that somebody did I think in a class or something. Green light means
[1007.30s -> 1019.99s]  go. It's me T posing and then T posing J's. Is this a classroom meme? Are you passing this
[1019.99s -> 1027.85s]  like around in class? Don't get me in trouble. Don't get yourself in trouble. You better turn
[1027.85s -> 1035.10s]  that over and there better be flash cards behind there. I don't want to get you in trouble.
[1039.35s -> 1044.49s]  Get me in trouble. Oh, there's a flash card all right. There's a flash all right.
[1045.22s -> 1051.13s]  Why would you say that? Pretty cool classroom. You can tell. Look at the thumb. There's like
[1051.13s -> 1057.50s]  the thumb on the corner right here. Just like with like a camera phone right here.
[1060.15s -> 1063.91s]  Right there, the second you took that photo, you probably just got yelled at.
[1063.91s -> 1071.99s]  It was like Steven. Yeah. What are you doing? No, no, just flash cards. Don't get me in trouble.
[1071.99s -> 1089.91s]  I've been seeing this a lot lately. The lion from Madagascar. It does that thing.
[1093.83s -> 1100.14s]  I mean, I don't know. Did I steal it from Madagascar? I don't think I did. I've never
[1100.14s -> 1109.32s]  seen this movie though. I didn't see this movie. I've never seen Madagascar. Does he actually go
[1109.32s -> 1122.60s]  like this? Like bang. I don't think he does. Does he? I've never seen this movie. Maybe I like it
[1122.60s -> 1129.80s]  was all like in the background one day. No, I refuse to believe that I stole content from the
[1129.80s -> 1140.60s]  lion Ben Stiller character in Madagascar. I refuse to think that. I refuse. No, like my like father
[1140.60s -> 1146.63s]  used to do this. Like this is my dad. He would be like, Oh, look at me. I don't, I don't do that.
[1146.63s -> 1155.82s]  I got to say, I got to see it. I got to see it. I think we've seen this already, but this is crazy.
[1156.38s -> 1166.20s]  This is from the Simpsons hit and run stream. It's terrifying. Like they're melting and
[1167.86s -> 1174.38s]  it's scary, but it's really, really well done. Yeah. This is a thumbnail for one of the videos.
[1174.38s -> 1179.03s]  Yeah. This is the second term of thumbnail. That's why I was like, I've seen this before.
[1184.46s -> 1193.16s]  It's crazy. It's good stuff. Yeah. Look at how this is as a, as a thumbnail.
[1194.12s -> 1197.16s]  You can still make up pretty much everything. That's how you know a thumbnail is good.
[1197.72s -> 1203.82s]  When it's this small and you can still tell everything that's going on. Excellent work.
[1205.29s -> 1218.79s]  Excellent work. Just like you. Hey Carnival. Carnival, uh, German. I love the fact that you
[1218.79s -> 1225.77s]  put a watermark on it because there's, there's, there's the million dollars in bits. Frog,
[1226.41s -> 1235.69s]  just a well-composed fun image. German lied about Wailord. You sure about that? Wait, where is he?
[1236.33s -> 1241.46s]  I don't know where he is. I think he was being cleaned. He's not here.
[1243.74s -> 1251.43s]  Whatever. I usually just sitting right here in this chair, but not right now. He lied.
[1252.07s -> 1260.06s]  No, this is great. I like that. I like the teeth here. I like the crumpled up car run over hat.
[1260.70s -> 1265.43s]  Looks good. Very, very, very, very good job. Just all around. Good shit.
[1266.23s -> 1277.05s]  Here's Jax mix new bald coin marshmallows, low sugar. That's what I like to see.
[1277.05s -> 1290.39s]  I would eat this. What's the flavor though? Marshmallows, chocolate. This is like Cheerios.
[1291.93s -> 1295.13s]  Che, like kind of like Chex. I actually don't like, I think Chex are gross.
[1295.69s -> 1300.26s]  So I wouldn't want these to be Chex flavored because I find them to be absolutely abhorrent.
[1303.77s -> 1309.70s]  Don't, don't, don't give me that look. How, how, no, no, no, excuse me. You guys don't just leave
[1309.70s -> 1316.14s]  all the Chex in the Chex mix. Just remove the Chex from the Chex mix and you have like a really
[1316.14s -> 1324.36s]  great snack. I don't eat the Chex. I eat around the Chex, even the ones that are cheese flavored.
[1324.36s -> 1330.04s]  No, I don't, they're gross. They're just like too crunchy and they just taste like, like just
[1330.68s -> 1340.25s]  pure wheat. You eat the pretzels, you eat the fake Cheetos because heaven forbid we call them real
[1340.25s -> 1346.81s]  Cheetos and you eat the fake Cheez-It triangles and the rings and the rings and the little flat
[1346.81s -> 1353.75s]  bread pieces and the little weird gross white puff balls. I'll take those over Chex. Don't
[1353.75s -> 1369.96s]  eat any of the Chex. The rye, the rye bits. He's insane because I don't like Chex. He hates good
[1369.96s -> 1375.86s]  snacks. Like there's no way that this many people like Chex. I don't think that's real.
[1376.42s -> 1386.44s]  I think I'm getting like messed with here. Do you eat Chex in like milk too? Because like I'm about
[1386.44s -> 1389.80s]  to like, we're going to be going like a thousand miles per hour if that's true.
[1390.52s -> 1401.13s]  I'm not seeing a whole lot of no's. I cannot believe this. Chex are good as fuck. Chex are
[1401.13s -> 1411.05s]  amazing. This has to be a generational thing. Am I actually not in the majority when I say that I
[1411.05s -> 1419.30s]  don't like Chex? I can't believe this. No, like the old people eat Chex. You guys call everybody
[1419.30s -> 1424.09s]  boomers here. Old people eat the fuck out of those things. It's like their favorite snack.
[1424.73s -> 1433.75s]  They've been around for 150 years. You're the real boomer. Chex. Oh, even the word. I just think of
[1433.75s -> 1446.33s]  it. This is called streamer. Is this like doom? Old people eat wheat thins. Yeah, you probably
[1446.33s -> 1459.43s]  eat those too. I'm the real zoomer. I eat like Bucky Charms, Gatorade, and Beyond Burgers.
[1460.44s -> 1478.14s]  That's all I eat. This is really good though. You eat plastic bottles? There's no, what do you mean
[1478.14s -> 1483.51s]  plastic? There's no plastic in Lucky Charms. Maybe a little bit of rat shit, but that's
[1483.51s -> 1497.98s]  FDA regulated. This is great. So this is, I'm like a doom character. What, is this in doom?
[1498.62s -> 1508.52s]  What's the globe? Rat shit is fine if it's regulated. Don't make me do the you eat over
[1508.52s -> 1518.90s]  an inch of dirt every meal thing again. I will. I'll do it and people will be very upset with me.
[1519.54s -> 1525.98s]  Here he goes. Just pretend I said it. You eat over an inch of dirt at every single meal you eat.
[1525.98s -> 1530.62s]  Every single meal you eat over an inch of dirt. I don't know how people don't understand that
[1531.42s -> 1537.78s]  when you're sitting at a dining room table. He did it. He did it. He actually did it.
[1539.67s -> 1552.73s]  This is awesome. Question marks don't get it. Think about it. That's, that's on you. Streamer.
[1556.02s -> 1562.18s]  Very good image. I like the aesthetic. What is that image even of? I think it's from green screen.
[1564.04s -> 1574.50s]  Ooh, look! This werelord. How much of an inch of dirt is in grass? You eat food off of the grass.
[1575.14s -> 1578.90s]  So if you made a sandwich right now, you'd put it down on the grass before you ate it.
[1579.70s -> 1594.02s]  What are you talking about? I like the color back here. I'm asking, I'm talking to one person here.
[1594.02s -> 1600.98s]  One person said they eat like on the grass. I forget that there's like four, five thousand people
[1600.98s -> 1619.08s]  here. I'm talking to one person. What? Uh, werelord. I like the face here. This is really good. I think
[1619.08s -> 1632.82s]  that really captures me. Flat and then like, it's very good. I don't know how people draw.
[1635.37s -> 1639.53s]  You have to have a ton of patience to really actually sit there and do all this.
[1640.33s -> 1647.34s]  Cause I will get to the first stage, the first step of drawing and you start like blocking
[1647.34s -> 1653.18s]  out what you want and then it's all wrong. My legs are too big and it's like I have to,
[1653.18s -> 1656.86s]  I've made them like these big parachute legs and then you erase it but then I,
[1656.86s -> 1661.86s]  I screwed it all up so I don't even want to do it again. I have a lot of respect for people that
[1661.86s -> 1666.42s]  can do shit like this, that can draw and design. It's very, very, very, very, very cool.
[1669.13s -> 1675.19s]  Just draw for thousands of hours. Yeah, that's kind of how you do it. People are very, very
[1675.19s -> 1683.51s]  talented in their craft and everybody draws differently too. That's like the best part.
[1685.42s -> 1693.75s]  This is really cute. I'm liking it. Nice. This is kind of how like a dog will look at you.
[1694.78s -> 1700.65s]  And I mean if you like, or hey, like hey Otto and he's like, like huh? Like come over here.
[1701.66s -> 1705.75s]  This is a very like dog looking over at something that they're interested in.
[1707.42s -> 1713.93s]  The side eye. Yeah, the dog side eye. Let's get in a little closer.
[1714.49s -> 1724.95s]  God, rats are awesome. I wish I could just actually pull the trigger and actually get a rat,
[1724.95s -> 1732.34s]  two rats. I always get two. I just think I was gonna get a lizard before a rat. Can you guys
[1732.34s -> 1744.31s]  believe that? I was gonna get a big ass lizard before I got a rat. It's tricky. Lizards are good
[1744.31s -> 1759.34s]  too. I know. No, not an iguana. What if I just got like a huge monitor lizard? They need a whole room
[1759.34s -> 1767.62s]  in your house by the way. They need, it's like having like a guest just there permanently,
[1767.62s -> 1773.22s]  like in a bedroom. They have to have their own room. Imagine having a fucking like lizard live
[1773.22s -> 1786.02s]  in your house. So it's like a kid, yeah. They are so cool though. They're not like main either.
[1786.02s -> 1790.41s]  Some of them can be, but there are some monitor lizards that are just, they don't give a shit
[1790.41s -> 1795.06s]  about anything. They're like, are you feeding me? I guess you and I are really good friends.
[1797.69s -> 1807.83s]  Get a lizard roommate. Maybe the lizard roommate will strain too. Give its own office.
[1811.03s -> 1818.46s]  That would be fucking crazy. Nah, too much. Too big. Maybe one day. Maybe one day.
[1818.86s -> 1823.83s]  But I do want a lizard though. I want like a bearded dragon. Just like a, like a, at least,
[1823.83s -> 1828.87s]  I want a bearded dragon that's at least as big as my head. As big as like by hand all the way down,
[1828.87s -> 1834.66s]  like all the way down my arm. But that's like, I don't know. Maybe, maybe like another time. I don't
[1834.66s -> 1858.57s]  know. Great photo though. Great pic. You guys nail eyes, can I just say? Like, I don't even know how
[1858.57s -> 1868.14s]  you do that. I do like that you have the fact that there's two in, two earbuds in. This is,
[1868.22s -> 1874.39s]  I know what shirt this is. This is the Aquaman shirt. I know what stream this is from.
[1874.39s -> 1888.23s]  Let's get in a little closer. See the real detail here. I like the shine here. Nice shine on the
[1888.23s -> 1897.50s]  hair because that's for real. See? You've got that little shine coloring coming in. That's not
[1897.50s -> 1910.41s]  turning white, is it? No, it's not. Is it white? No, it's just like a lighter blonde, right?
[1911.37s -> 1915.83s]  Uh oh. I look in the mirror every single day. It's just the width of the lights hit in my face,
[1917.32s -> 1940.17s]  I think. Cover the eyes and it looks like the TF2 soldier. It kind of does. It kind of does.
[1941.29s -> 1949.99s]  That's pretty cool. That's century. Get a haircut. You guys act like my hair is down to my ankles.
[1953.50s -> 1959.98s]  It's not that long. It's like not down to here. It's just like a normal hair.
[1964.04s -> 1970.02s]  No, I like it. It's staying. I'm gonna grow it on my face too. No, I would never do that.
[1973.21s -> 1978.73s]  This is, I remember this one. This is somebody did. This is from playing Jackbox, I think,
[1979.53s -> 1985.54s]  and this is what they were able to do in the drawing game. Dr. Swiss Cheese getting papers
[1985.54s -> 1992.34s]  from Dr. Rat. You have like a tiny little cube to work with in Jackbox. How do you even make a
[1992.34s -> 2001.35s]  fucking volcano? Don't you only have like 40 seconds to draw this stuff? It seems very hard
[2001.35s -> 2011.34s]  to do this. Dreamy live streamer. Caption Twitch streamer. What if you have a 43 inch tablet?
[2011.34s -> 2018.86s]  This is Drawception, not Jackbox. Right, okay. Blue Guy with Fedora. This is German Neptune.
[2018.86s -> 2027.58s]  Does that emote still exist? Did I delete that emote? I haven't seen that emote in a long time.
[2028.30s -> 2035.72s]  Oh, it's German Egg. Right, right, right. I feel like that's an emote I never see anymore.
[2036.44s -> 2046.50s]  We'll get rid of it. This is great though. Classy Egg. You can't remember his own lore?
[2047.30s -> 2051.30s]  I know my own lore, but that was, what do you mean I don't know my own lore? That is German Neptune,
[2051.30s -> 2056.79s]  but it was just so bad that I just uploaded it and called it an Egg. That is the lore. That's my own
[2056.79s -> 2067.59s]  lore. I know my own lore. I know my own channel. That's, that is German Neptune. Let's keep going.
[2069.82s -> 2078.17s]  This one scares me a little. This one freaks me out. It's Lil Germo, number one clown streamer.
[2079.48s -> 2087.06s]  It's just like, this is like, unsettles me. This is for Halloween, it seems, like the last few weeks.
[2087.06s -> 2094.20s]  Pretty relevant. Apparently I am a rat puppet, but it freaks me out because
[2095.43s -> 2102.23s]  this is typically what I wear when I stream. Except maybe like shorts, or the other way around.
[2102.23s -> 2111.32s]  This is like, it's too real for me, including a diaper. That's not a diaper. That's a pair of
[2111.32s -> 2122.46s]  underwear. That's not a diaper. I get like, yeah, I get huge hands. That's not a diaper. That is a
[2122.46s -> 2133.10s]  pair of underwear. Yeah, those are tighty whities. There's a difference. Not very much of a difference,
[2133.10s -> 2149.62s]  but there is. Tighty whities really are just thin diapers. I don't wear tighty whities. Nope, sorry,
[2149.62s -> 2160.73s]  not on this guy. I don't wear tighty whities. Actually, there was one time where Kim and I,
[2160.73s -> 2168.23s]  I think we're on vacation somewhere. I think it was, she came to, whether it was E3 a couple years
[2168.23s -> 2174.31s]  ago, I don't remember what it was, but I ran out of underwear on the trip. And it was like,
[2174.31s -> 2178.63s]  I just have to get underwear. Let's just stop at like, a random store. I don't remember what the
[2178.63s -> 2186.71s]  store was, but I got a package of, I got a package of just tighty whity default underwear. And they
[2186.71s -> 2193.27s]  were huge, even though they were my size. And they just, they would like, cartoon tighty whity
[2193.27s -> 2199.30s]  underwear. And I remember just her laughing hysterically at me because I just had on this
[2199.30s -> 2203.14s]  tighty whities and I walked out of like, the hotel bathroom and like, brushing my teeth.
[2204.34s -> 2210.46s]  I just looked like a fucking idiot. And they were just like, bulky and all. They really probably
[2210.46s -> 2218.73s]  did look like a diaper. It wasn't the underwear she was laughing at. Oh, all right, I see what
[2218.73s -> 2234.76s]  you're doing here. Nice. You bastard. Ban that person for life. But yeah, I don't, I don't like
[2234.76s -> 2240.97s]  just tighty whity underwear. And they always show people in commercials wearing them. There's this
[2240.97s -> 2246.73s]  weird propaganda campaign with like shitty default, just tighty whity underwear, where they show these
[2246.73s -> 2254.52s]  like huge, handsome, like Chad guys wearing them. Nobody wears those. I don't, nobody buys those.
[2257.93s -> 2265.54s]  It's like, like tighty whity commercials are like the Switch commercials. Like they, it's the
[2265.54s -> 2270.82s]  equivalent of having like a big strong Chad guy in tighty whities in front of a camera is the same
[2270.82s -> 2281.61s]  thing of having a party on the roof with like 30 people all hovered around one Switch. So I don't
[2281.61s -> 2290.42s]  know who's buying it. Not me. Not anymore. Not after that trip. Box of briefs are where it's at.
[2290.42s -> 2301.75s]  Absolutely. Yes. You only buy tighty whity underwear, in my opinion, in like an emergency
[2301.75s -> 2309.00s]  like that. That's like emergency ration underwear. Not for any other purpose. And it does what it's
[2309.00s -> 2315.11s]  supposed to do. My name is, this photo is very, very good, but it's very creepy. Like who are these
[2315.11s -> 2325.72s]  people up here? Are these supposed to be you guys? But you guys are in here. Why are you in my house?
[2326.44s -> 2336.74s]  It's creepy, but it's very well made. Nice job. I, this one, I didn't mean to put this one up.
[2336.74s -> 2350.46s]  This is, I, I didn't, I, I, that must have stayed. This is me as the Joker. All right, when, okay,
[2350.46s -> 2354.22s]  when I go through all these images, like there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them,
[2354.22s -> 2358.46s]  right? Sometimes I save a bunch. I put like a bunch of tabs up and I go like, what do I want
[2358.46s -> 2362.22s]  to put that here? Maybe we'll put that over here. Uh, that's a good image. We'll put that. And then
[2362.22s -> 2365.66s]  I go, maybe this one too. Maybe. And like, I have like a bunch of that. I, they have kind of a rough,
[2365.66s -> 2372.44s]  like go through them all and like kind of condense them. I mean, it's, it's good. It's good,
[2373.45s -> 2380.73s]  but I'm not, it's, I'm not going to have this as an emote. No, you know why this is not,
[2380.73s -> 2384.97s]  I'm not going to have this as an emote because when this is small enough, it's just the Joker.
[2387.11s -> 2396.25s]  When this is at like 10%, that's just the Joker. That's not me. That's just Joaquin Phoenix.
[2398.73s -> 2402.65s]  It's still you. No, but that we're, that's not as small as it's, it's going to be. It's going to be
[2402.65s -> 2417.10s]  like 50% smaller than that. No, I'm not the Joker. I'm the Riddler. Get it right. Something,
[2417.10s -> 2420.30s]  something, something, something, Jim Carrey, something, something. It's because it was Jim
[2420.30s -> 2430.90s]  Carrey. I'm not going to do that face anymore. I already said I wasn't going to do it. I love
[2430.90s -> 2447.29s]  riding the frog. This is awesome. What is it? I like, I just like this. It's frog in the park too.
[2447.85s -> 2459.22s]  Tell us a riddle. Did you know Batman? Did you know that you eat over two inches of dirt
[2459.22s -> 2465.67s]  every single meal? What are you talking about, Riddler? Well, if you can't get it, then I'm
[2465.75s -> 2485.35s]  sorry, Batman. That's where you die. Good photo. How's that a riddle? That's a riddle.
[2488.82s -> 2495.58s]  It's a puzzle. It's a puzzle joke. It's a joke puzzle. That's a riddle. You have to think about
[2495.58s -> 2501.10s]  it. A joke is a riddle. A joke just is a riddle. That's a humorous riddle. That's why you have to,
[2501.10s -> 2510.25s]  what are you talking about? A joke is a humorous riddle. Oh, you, God, did you think you know
[2510.25s -> 2526.31s]  comedy? You think you know comedy, Batman? It's a humorous riddle. Oh my God. I'm sorry, chat.
[2527.05s -> 2532.89s]  Yeah, I might as well get off camera and just play this. This is actually pretty good.
[2536.92s -> 2548.36s]  That wasn't a joke or a riddle. How is a joke not a riddle? You set up a punch line that the people
[2548.36s -> 2555.61s]  don't know what it is until you tell them. Three guys walk into a bar. One sits down and asks a
[2555.61s -> 2565.08s]  question. Like, it's just a long drawn out punch line. The punch line is the solution to the riddle.
[2565.08s -> 2576.54s]  You don't know the answer to that until you hear it. Come on. You know, it's a question that you
[2576.54s -> 2581.10s]  don't have the answer to until it's given to you by the fucking master puzzle creator of the joke.
[2592.15s -> 2597.56s]  So you are the joker, not the riddler. They live in the same house. They live in the same house.
[2597.56s -> 2614.31s]  Who cares? Oh, God. They all share, like, the same fucking flat. The best part about this one
[2615.11s -> 2625.02s]  is this is, uh, this is me kissing Kim that she took a picture of and they omitted it.
[2625.02s -> 2630.30s]  And it's just me. There's an image floating around of somebody, I don't know if we showed it before,
[2630.30s -> 2636.38s]  of me kissing myself with different clothes and different hair. And it's really, really fucking
[2636.38s -> 2658.30s]  weird. But Kim is supposed to be here. So this just looks really strange. This is called Mini,
[2658.30s -> 2675.40s]  Mini, no, that is it. That's Mini Man instead of Gemini Man. You motherfucker. Gemini Man. Oh,
[2675.40s -> 2683.94s]  you're embarrassing me now. What is this? Oh, is this it? Hold on. This, I need to put this on
[2683.94s -> 2693.45s]  camera. This is fucked up. Oh, this is so, this fucking weird, man. Hold on. Let me get this on
[2693.45s -> 2725.48s]  camera. It's fucking so weird. It's just so, oh, it's because we're making the same face.
[2729.93s -> 2736.06s]  What an egomaniac. I didn't make, I didn't make this, I didn't make this riddle.
[2746.04s -> 2759.74s]  Let's move on. Disgusting. It's the same, like, and look, I know, I got criticized for that image.
[2759.74s -> 2769.10s]  Let me go back. I got criticized for this image because, yes, I look like a corpse. I look like
[2769.10s -> 2777.69s]  somebody in a casket. I understand that. But the photo was taken. The photo was taken right when,
[2777.69s -> 2783.77s]  like, we first started kissing and it was just like, oh, it started there. I mean, like, I look
[2783.77s -> 2796.38s]  like, I look like I'm just asleep. I look like I'm sleeping. Another one. I'm not clicking it. This
[2796.38s -> 2801.94s]  is community, that is community content. You're right. This is community content. That's correct.
[2802.66s -> 2810.31s]  Click it. Hold on. We can't just get stuck. We got, like, another three hours of footage.
[2810.31s -> 2834.68s]  We haven't even got to the video section. All right. Whatever. All right. That's it. That's it.
[2834.68s -> 2861.29s]  That's it. Okay. That was good. Let's move on. This is, I like, this is almost like clay. Like,
[2861.29s -> 2869.62s]  I've made it, like, it's been molded out of clay. I need Dead Rising today. I already beat it.
[2870.26s -> 2874.42s]  I'd be Dead Rising all the way through. We're going to start Dead Rising 2.
[2878.71s -> 2898.44s]  Don't say tomorrow. Hold on. No, no. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea.
[2903.35s -> 2910.09s]  Maybe. No. In, like, a few, no. Next week. I'm going to do something else. We just did Dead
[2910.09s -> 2916.90s]  Rising. I just streamed it, like, the whole thing. No. Not tomorrow. Not the next day.
[2916.90s -> 2921.94s]  Maybe another time. Next week. You'll see. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I got to talk,
[2921.94s -> 2930.01s]  we got to announce this because, like, what the heck? I, over the next couple days,
[2930.73s -> 2934.57s]  there's going to be a new channel that gets opened up in the Discord.
[2935.21s -> 2946.04s]  What do you think it's going to be? It is going to be green screen DLC for free discussion.
[2946.04s -> 2950.04s]  Over the next, like, probably few, probably, like, in a couple days. It'll be up there.
[2950.68s -> 2956.52s]  And then that stream, green screen DLC for free, will be probably in, like, two or three weeks.
[2959.02s -> 2962.06s]  And then for the next community content night, we're going to see, we're going to see what you
[2962.06s -> 2972.82s]  come up with. But that'll be probably in, like, two or three weeks from now. But this is great.
[2972.82s -> 2980.02s]  I like the background of this one. This, was this brush? Like, take a look down here. You know what
[2980.02s -> 2993.11s]  I mean? This is brush stroke, right? Looks like it. I like when, like, the canvas shows up in the
[2993.11s -> 2998.63s]  background. You can see. Because then it adds, like, you got the white and then you got, like,
[2998.63s -> 3003.93s]  the maroon and then you got, like, the face. It's really, really good. Excellent work.
[3010.23s -> 3026.10s]  Here's the, look at those yellow teeth. There's the egg. This is unbelievable. Yolk teeth.
[3026.74s -> 3038.22s]  Nice work. You captured his essence very well. He, this is kind of how he is all day. And there's
[3038.22s -> 3043.00s]  blood in his mouth. Yeah, because look at how sharp his teeth are. We went over this already.
[3046.47s -> 3055.99s]  Now what are you guys linking? Uh, nice job. We haven't seen very much egg. He's been in two
[3055.99s -> 3064.78s]  videos ever. So, then why would we ever see him again? Click the link. Hold on. I'm in the middle
[3064.78s -> 3081.27s]  of something. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not real, right? That's not real, is it? No, that's
[3081.27s -> 3102.57s]  not real. Is that real? That's not good. What the fuck? God damn it. You gotta be fucking kidding
[3102.57s -> 3111.72s]  me. How long does those stay there for? How long does it stay up like that? Oh my god damn it.
[3111.72s -> 3129.08s]  Okay. Well, excellent work on the egg. It's gone now. Imagine seeing that shit. There's, uh,
[3129.72s -> 3137.29s]  Jerma Myers. How, so we're going to get a lot of Halloween themed ones because Halloween was,
[3137.29s -> 3147.18s]  like, two weeks ago. So, it's still there. That thumbnail is so bad because it's,
[3147.18s -> 3154.52s]  it's a just chatting and it's somebody with their webcam in the corner, which is obviously
[3154.52s -> 3162.02s]  the person that's in the photo reacting to them, like, hooking up with themself. That's not,
[3162.02s -> 3170.28s]  that's fucking bad. I, you scroll right by that and you don't even click, you go, no, no, no.
[3170.28s -> 3181.96s]  God damn it. Uh, this is good. I like how it's the, it's the mask is what it is. Like, that's
[3181.96s -> 3195.59s]  not even what I look like under there. Nice touch. Jerma actually looks like unmasked Mike
[3195.59s -> 3204.50s]  Myers. I don't. Wait, I don't even, what does unmasked Mike Myers look like? I mean, true.
[3208.90s -> 3213.94s]  There's been like 30 Halloween movies. I don't know which one. I've only seen like 10 minutes
[3213.94s -> 3229.74s]  of two of them. This is really good though. This image will haunt me forever. This is like, okay,
[3230.79s -> 3236.15s]  you know those cursed videos that you can watch and it's like, don't watch this video. You'll get
[3236.15s -> 3239.83s]  cursed if you watch it for more than 10 seconds. There've been, there've been reports of people
[3239.83s -> 3247.32s]  who have, have watched this video and then they died. Like that's what this is. Don't watch,
[3247.32s -> 3256.49s]  don't look at this for more than 10 seconds. Actually, it's like, this is like actually scary.
[3257.86s -> 3271.42s]  I feel like it's moving. Look at it for a while. No, no, no, no, no, no. Next one. Next one.
[3271.42s -> 3279.51s]  Cause I don't want it to be on the thumbnail for the live thumbnail. That's a huge clear image of
[3279.51s -> 3282.47s]  like a gross face I've made, but let's go back and look at it one more time. So it's not the
[3282.47s -> 3291.58s]  thumbnail. Okay. I always thought that hair was probably the hardest thing to do. All you artists
[3291.58s -> 3304.71s]  out there and nice job. Love the watermark. Hair seems impossible. Every strand. Do you have to do
[3304.71s -> 3316.52s]  every strand? I have a crooked, somebody said crooked nose. Yeah. What about it? I have a crooked
[3316.52s -> 3323.59s]  nose. I got hit, I got hit in the face when I, when I was like fucking 12 on a trampoline.
[3324.23s -> 3328.47s]  I jumped on a trampoline and I landed on my back and my knees, I landed with my knees up and my
[3328.47s -> 3334.38s]  knees came back and hit me right in the fucking face. And it like for life. And then I got hit
[3334.38s -> 3344.76s]  with a baseball, like right here. And then I got hit with a recycling bin right here. And then I
[3344.76s -> 3351.61s]  fell down some stairs and like bumped it hard. How did you get hit in the face with a recycling bin?
[3355.48s -> 3359.80s]  Taking out the recycling and I was flipping it around. I was like doing like flips with it
[3359.80s -> 3373.51s]  because I was fucking 13 and stupid. It's a garbage truck accident. Like trying to like a
[3373.51s -> 3376.63s]  water. Okay. Remember the water, you remember the water bottle thing where it's like, I'm going to
[3376.63s -> 3381.43s]  try to flip it. So it like lands on it's like this, right? Imagine you doing that with something
[3381.43s -> 3385.75s]  that's 20 times as big and like throwing it up in the air and trying to catch it in your mouth,
[3385.75s -> 3401.59s]  like a popcorn kernel. When you, when you're a kid, things seem like they're fun and interesting.
[3401.59s -> 3406.39s]  They're dangerous. Don't do those things. Oh, it's going to be the thumbnail. It's going to be the
[3406.39s -> 3414.65s]  thumbnail. Not anymore. Says the guy that's probably done enough stupid shit, even the last like two
[3414.65s -> 3424.94s]  years on this stream. You can't ignore this forever. Oh, I can and I will. I can and I will. No,
[3424.94s -> 3438.66s]  it's not. Is it the thumbnail? It's not the thumbnail. Stop it. I have to, I'm in the middle
[3438.66s -> 3444.18s]  of something. All right. I got to, I got to go. I thought that was auto. That's not even fucking
[3444.18s -> 3466.38s]  real. What? This is fake. This is a fake image. This didn't just happen. Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye.
[3468.57s -> 3478.55s]  Lost stakes. Wait, what, what category is this supposed to be in? Why are there like stakes and
[3478.55s -> 3491.59s]  like stews? Chill your mind in the dishwasher. What the fuck is this stream? And is it still
[3491.59s -> 3500.73s]  live? Because if it is, I hope it's, I hope it is. Chill your mind in the dishwasher. What a great
[3500.73s -> 3518.62s]  stream. Oh my God. That's funny. All right. See, if they're still live, give them a follow. Barbecue,
[3518.62s -> 3528.73s]  smoked brisket and lamb. Holy shit. These channels seem fucking cool. I should watch all these.
[3530.74s -> 3540.62s]  All right. Let's go. This is a compilation of work from Gen 2. We can't see them because I'm in the
[3540.62s -> 3544.22s]  way. So let me get out of the way for a second. So you see the watermark. Good watermark. Excellent
[3544.22s -> 3557.46s]  watermark. The thumbnail is the face. Whatever. So here is just a compilation of things they did.
[3558.02s -> 3563.43s]  I like the rat. Let's get in close so you can see these. So we can see them all. There's a really
[3563.43s -> 3579.38s]  nice render of bald coin. I like that one. Here is, does that mean like vaping? The pumpkin. What is
[3579.38s -> 3585.08s]  that? Is it like a tray? Like a dinner tray or something? Like a plast, like a keychain. It looks
[3585.08s -> 3600.50s]  awesome. Chill your mind. Yeah. I mean, I would rather have, you guys know this already. I would
[3600.50s -> 3605.78s]  rather have a coffee and fried chicken with like, I really would rather eat this meal. This meal is
[3605.78s -> 3615.85s]  way better than this. Steak and, no, this is a better meal for me. Save the line. I can't, otherwise
[3616.57s -> 3625.72s]  we won't get over it. There's coffee here. There's fried chicken here. And there's also a puffy
[3627.24s -> 3638.49s]  snack. That's Cheetos. Coffee. No, no, we've moved on. We've moved on.
[3639.29s -> 3650.73s]  Hold on. Okay. They're gone. This is cool though. I want to do this. Let's see if I can find one.
[3652.04s -> 3662.78s]  Compact word search. There's coffee right there. There's coffee. There's Cheetos. There's coffee.
[3662.78s -> 3678.52s]  Cheetos. And there's coffee, Cheetos, and chicken. There it is. Got it. Okay, I want to find a
[3678.52s -> 3690.10s]  Germacraft right there. Got it. How about, uh, pee pants? Pee? No. Pee. Can you go diagonal?
[3694.04s -> 3704.74s]  Pee pants. There it is. Nice. Got it. He's going all out. No, just a no. There's a nice, uh, rat
[3704.74s -> 3719.80s]  painting. Click here for your free iPod Touch 5. The fake ad on this page. What the fuck? These
[3719.80s -> 3730.23s]  are great though. I like the compilation. Click it. It doesn't do anything. Okay, it doesn't work.
[3730.23s -> 3751.77s]  It's an image, guys. It's not a website. I'm clicking. Do you not hear? See? That's fake.
[3752.33s -> 3761.94s]  What? Let's keep going. This mouse sucks though. Don't ever buy this. Like, I'm going to give you
[3761.94s -> 3772.06s]  like, anti. Don't, um, just don't buy this ever. Let's keep going. Oh, Jojo's Bazaar Adventure.
[3772.06s -> 3780.49s]  Germa 5 foot 8. Featuring the Haunt Single QRS. Rat Records 5.98. This is a nice touch.
[3780.49s -> 3786.28s]  This is hard to emulate. What you have to do here is you have to actually get a photo of this with
[3786.28s -> 3791.16s]  that price on it, because that font doesn't exist. And you have to doctor it up. And then you got to
[3791.16s -> 3801.10s]  make it a little dirty. This is some work. It's just a pose. No, I'm talking about the price up
[3801.10s -> 3807.18s]  here. That's hard to emulate that. That's like the exact font. I'm sorry. When I, when I go to like,
[3807.90s -> 3815.88s]  font, fontditty.org, whatever the hell it's called, they don't have grocery store price tag font.
[3815.88s -> 3831.13s]  That took work. fontditty.com. Featuring the Haunt Single QRS. This is great. I like the,
[3831.13s -> 3837.78s]  how it's a little washed out here at the bottom. Excellent job. And you've got a, you've got a
[3837.78s -> 3851.56s]  watermark. Nice job, Cold. Good stuff. Very well edited. Demonwood Zaraxos at the Germa Rumble.
[3851.56s -> 3861.82s]  One night only. New Year's Zoo 2014. Doors open at 5 p.m. This is great. It's like those bar photos,
[3861.82s -> 3876.33s]  bar posters for random events. One night only. This is like the great photo. This is what great
[3876.33s -> 3893.14s]  on a wall. Make this a poster. Make this a poster. Make it a shirt. Make it a poster. This is so good.
[3894.23s -> 3900.12s]  Make it both. Make it a coffee mug. Man, there's too many things. Make more merch. Merchandise,
[3900.12s -> 3908.71s]  merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. I would consider purchasing this. I would, holy shit,
[3908.71s -> 3917.90s]  this is like unanimously, oh my god, you guys want to buy this. Merchandise, all right, well,
[3917.90s -> 3926.06s]  all right, hold on, wait, hold on. Just wait, let's, well, just hold on to that. Make this an emote.
[3927.10s -> 3939.91s]  This doesn't work as an emote. Pay the art. No, if I was going to do this for like a poster,
[3940.47s -> 3964.78s]  they would get a majority of the money. 51%. That's still a majority. 50 point, 50.1%.
[3965.42s -> 3979.59s]  It's technically still a majority. No, I'm fucking kidding. Or is he? Pay them an exposure.
[3989.80s -> 3995.85s]  We'll figure this out because there's also, there's also like, people have made stuff in this
[3995.85s -> 4003.21s]  community, like fireman, like this type of stuff. I would want to do that right. You know what I
[4003.21s -> 4009.37s]  mean? I really don't want to just be like, oh, thanks for the image. Yoink, and now it's a poster.
[4009.37s -> 4014.94s]  Thanks for the money. Actually, we've talked about it once or twice about doing another shirt,
[4014.94s -> 4022.68s]  doing like community shirts. But I would, I would want to make sure that it was like fair. I would
[4022.68s -> 4027.48s]  want the person that actually made it to be happy with it and happy with what they got. But that's
[4027.48s -> 4033.19s]  a process though. That's not just as simple as one, two, three. I would want that to be them
[4033.19s -> 4046.15s]  then to be happy. Regulations. Just make this a hoodie. But that, but there's another thing too
[4046.15s -> 4050.71s]  here is, I mean, let's get real. Ready? Let's get real. No more riddles. Okay. Like forget about the
[4051.43s -> 4063.11s]  riddles. When you take stuff from the community, for instance, like this, you end up, it's like,
[4063.11s -> 4066.79s]  there's been hundreds of images that have come through that people were like, oh, well, that was
[4066.79s -> 4072.31s]  awesome. That was really great. But one of them is the shirt. It's like, well, mine, what was wrong
[4072.31s -> 4074.63s]  with mine? What was wrong with that one? What was wrong with that? We should have that one and that
[4074.63s -> 4079.35s]  one. You have to, I just, you have to be careful just because I never want to have anybody think
[4079.35s -> 4083.91s]  like, oh, well, this one was the shirt. Cause it was the fucking best. Yours wasn't any good.
[4087.21s -> 4095.05s]  It can get a little weird sometimes. No one cares about that. I know, but still it would have to be
[4095.05s -> 4102.12s]  something that we unanimously thought was a good idea. Cause I wouldn't, I don't want anybody to
[4102.12s -> 4108.28s]  think that like their images or their art as great or incredible as it was, is in like a competition
[4108.92s -> 4114.97s]  for a t-shirt or for a poster or something. You know what I'm saying? It would just be as simple
[4114.97s -> 4120.23s]  as this is, it just happened this way. I don't want this to ever be a competition of who makes
[4120.23s -> 4127.26s]  the best art. That's not the point. And if something like this, if that ever ended up happening
[4127.26s -> 4131.90s]  for some reason, it's not because this is the best image that ever was put through,
[4131.90s -> 4139.10s]  it's because it just happened that way. You know what I'm saying? No, you know what I'm saying?
[4139.10s -> 4146.46s]  You know what I'm saying? He did it. Slot fucking slime on me. He did it. Um, we'll see though.
[4146.46s -> 4150.38s]  I'm open to it, but I would want it to be done right. I'd want it to be fair to whoever was
[4150.38s -> 4153.90s]  given the image and I would want it to be the right thing that we all thought was a good idea.
[4154.54s -> 4161.98s]  Okay. All right. Back to the riddles. I don't know if this is supposed to be in this.
[4161.98s -> 4168.74s]  What am I getting, like a windows update? Am I actually getting a win? Don't you fucking dare.
[4168.74s -> 4179.74s]  I saw the ring. Merch. Get this on a poster. Get this on a pizza box. Make this a shirt.
[4180.46s -> 4190.66s]  How does somebody already have that ready to go? No, not everything is merch.
[4190.66s -> 4199.62s]  There's a good potential fun emote though. I need emotes too. Derma, but it's me. Germ yourself.
[4200.76s -> 4203.32s]  This is supposed to be like a fake, like Snapchat filter.
[4205.64s -> 4222.26s]  What is this? So this is a fake Snapchat filter thing. It's me at the DMV? I included it. I've
[4222.26s -> 4229.91s]  been looking at a lot of images. Derma, but it's me. Germ yourself. This is like a take on the
[4230.79s -> 4244.12s]  Snapchat. Look at me. Today, the change of faces. It's like Brad Pitt today, right? Why the DMV
[4244.12s -> 4250.55s]  though? I don't understand that. Here's Twitch chat versus Germa 95. Rob versus me brawler.
[4251.37s -> 4260.28s]  On day four, carnival. Insert text here. This is cute. This is cute and has a lot of layers.
[4264.49s -> 4276.87s]  Nice job. That's cute. This is you guys. And it even has, look at this. So it's Rob,
[4276.87s -> 4281.43s]  but look at that little piece of paper. That's the smile that just was tacked on there to be you.
[4282.23s -> 4299.06s]  I love it. Excellent job. Everyone's going to say emote, but when it's shrunk down,
[4299.62s -> 4304.09s]  it just looks like a car with hair. I don't even know what this looks like.
[4306.07s -> 4315.32s]  It's better like this. It's much better like this. This is not emote. This is desktop background.
[4315.32s -> 4328.76s]  It's perfect. Make it a B-T-T-V emote. You know what's going to be interesting? Can you imagine
[4328.76s -> 4334.76s]  if eventually Twitch and streaming and stuff is so normal that they start teaching these things in
[4334.76s -> 4340.90s]  class like at college? It's like how to connect your B-T-T-V and enable emotes. There's going to
[4340.90s -> 4346.34s]  be like Twitch stream college classes and they're going to look, I'm going to be in a book somewhere.
[4346.90s -> 4365.94s]  You're going to be fanning through like a hundred years. There he is. Ego maniac. What? I was the
[4365.94s -> 4382.44s]  first person to ever sing on stream. That happened in like 2011. I was the first person. I was the
[4382.44s -> 4387.51s]  first person to get in a rowboat and row down a river on stream. Remember we went over the
[4387.51s -> 4393.11s]  waterfall and I was like holy shit that's like 400 feet drop and I like I went down it was like
[4394.55s -> 4398.31s]  it was like holy fuck the camera panned back and it showed me going all the way down the waterfall
[4398.87s -> 4402.55s]  and then like I bursted out of the water like a shampoo commercial and it was like
[4404.15s -> 4412.94s]  and it was like pogchamp. Everyone freaked the fuck out. I was the first person to do that.
[4412.94s -> 4432.06s]  I'll be in that book. Oh look at this. They're in the same family. Shito. They're so cute.
[4433.06s -> 4441.13s]  I just want a video game with what's it called? What are those actual? They have an insanely long
[4441.13s -> 4449.82s]  name. The face flute. What is it actually called? I want a face flute video game where you walk
[4449.82s -> 4462.22s]  around and like make noise and stuff. Automaton. An automaton. Right. The face flute. Don't you
[4462.22s -> 4469.06s]  just want that to be like an item in a game? It's in Kirby? No not that one. Don't stop.
[4469.78s -> 4491.38s]  Holy shit. What the fuck? Watch this. I look like a different person. Watch watch me chameleon into
[4491.38s -> 4514.78s]  a different person. Holy shit that was kind of weird. He really does do it. He actually fucking
[4514.78s -> 4530.49s]  does this. What the fuck. Look at me. I need to like look up a clip of if this is real.
[4531.13s -> 4541.90s]  I need to see. God damn it. I hate seeing this in reality. Give me a link. I want to see it.
[4543.86s -> 4558.28s]  Give me a link. I want to see this once and for all. The lion roar. Fuck. It is the same thing
[4558.28s -> 4571.19s]  that I do. God damn it. But it's not though. Fuck. It really is the same thing. Hold on. I need to
[4571.19s -> 4593.48s]  get this on camera. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. I'm gonna go pee. I'll see
[4593.48s -> 4871.10s]  you guys in like fucking a minute. Hello. Sorry it took a little while. He's chilling his mind
[4871.10s -> 4891.62s]  in the dishwasher. You scared me. Get jump scared. It's still going? The dishwasher is
[4891.62s -> 4904.39s]  actually still going? Wow. All right where were we? Oh right. That's right. We were in the middle
[4904.39s -> 4922.62s]  of doing this. It's even like the right elbow placement. Like god damn it. Whatever. It is what
[4922.62s -> 4931.13s]  it is. I was just like in my room. Just had my pillow in my face. Just going like. It's a cool
[4931.13s -> 4951.08s]  pose. It's a really cool pose. Why can I not go forward? You know it took me like I it was like
[4951.08s -> 4957.85s]  a double take to see if like this is like a real photo of me. Like when was it? Oh no no no no no.
[4960.22s -> 4983.29s]  Very clearly it's not. You're too tall. Djerba. There it is. Of course we got Yen Wen with an
[4983.29s -> 4990.87s]  insanely. This is the type of shit I'm talking about when I say art. I don't understand. How do you,
[4992.71s -> 5000.97s]  how do you even make that happen? This is when I was showing you guys how I shave.
[5001.61s -> 5007.05s]  But seriously it's it's like it's like it's really happening on the screen.
[5010.06s -> 5017.26s]  The pressure at the the trajectory of the fingers going into the cheek. The wrinkling.
[5017.90s -> 5030.02s]  This is some like renaissance style. Like the like old school like paintings of people. It's
[5030.02s -> 5042.01s]  unbelievable. Uh Alamanda just gave five community subs. Thank you. It looks like there's uh some
[5042.01s -> 5053.59s]  line work going on down here. This is like Michelangelo type shit. The hands. You can see
[5053.59s -> 5066.46s]  you can see the skin folding. That's like that's what my hand looks like. Yen Wen again just
[5066.46s -> 5073.46s]  unbelievable work. Egomaniac. Me talking about my my my skin folds on my fingers.
[5074.10s -> 5089.50s]  It's kind of gross actually. Egomania at its finest. Oh link and chat. Link and chat. Link
[5089.50s -> 5096.50s]  and chat. Link and chat. Link and chat. Not right now. But awesome yet again. Yeah Yen Wen.
[5096.50s -> 5109.43s]  Awesome yet again. Well written original structured joke. No emotion for two minutes.
[5110.33s -> 5130.02s]  Oh shit. Um but there was a reason why oh shit was so funny. It wasn't just somebody said oh shit.
[5130.02s -> 5136.25s]  It was every single character had a different way that they said it and they all said it.
[5136.25s -> 5150.22s]  That's more that's well structured original riddles. I'll take a loss on this one okay.
[5150.22s -> 5153.66s]  I'll take a loss on that one. Not on the first one. Absolutely. I'll take a loss on this one.
[5154.30s -> 5173.77s]  Whatever. I did cry laughing at that. But there was but that um but hold on. It was the it was
[5173.77s -> 5179.13s]  the the first part with the gym and the loud song and like the if that was what that person was
[5179.13s -> 5185.53s]  listening to as like a remix. That's what was funny to me. It wasn't the human biology of going
[5185.53s -> 5198.41s]  to the bathroom. No it was not just that. Shito man incoming. Look at this Otama dude. Look at
[5198.41s -> 5207.58s]  this Otama dude. This is so cute. You've combined you've evolved Shito into a new character.
[5207.58s -> 5219.74s]  Or is it just Shito with hair? With with beautiful hair might I add. The fusion to Anne is singing.
[5220.57s -> 5228.70s]  And I like the this. Look at this. This is good. This is like just odd sounds coming out. Just like
[5229.82s -> 5246.09s]  just broken. Oh it's a shirt. Oh it's a mug. Oh it's a car keychain. It's very very good though.
[5246.09s -> 5253.99s]  By Groove Wizard. Nice watermark. Put watermarks on your stuff please. So people know who it was.
[5255.54s -> 5260.23s]  Watermark it. Uh excellent excellent job. A Shito Otama dude.
[5267.13s -> 5279.27s]  That's crazy. Oh no fire man got gobbled up. That's not good. What's what's with all the blood?
[5279.27s -> 5293.74s]  That's blood. Is it? Or is it ketchup? Oh that's the dork cube. Okay right right right you're right.
[5294.46s -> 5303.16s]  It is it is blood. It just was in a box and shipped to you. Very good. I like the corner.
[5303.16s -> 5309.56s]  Just like oh this is bad. This is bad. Just say it's ketchup. Yeah that's what I just did.
[5312.07s -> 5320.79s]  Good stuff. I think there's another one. There is. I don't even know where half these photos are
[5320.79s -> 5333.83s]  from. Oh there's Otto. There's you. See if I can recognize all these. McChicken. Turbo Raptor.
[5333.83s -> 5345.54s]  I'm not sure what that is. I think that's just in the game. There's a rat. Turbo Venus. Of course
[5345.54s -> 5356.57s]  we've got the uh the poses. Beanbag Sonic. All rolled up by me who's crying. I'm apparently not
[5356.57s -> 5367.00s]  happy about doing all this. This is good and fire man's is still good to go. Not even rolled up.
[5367.00s -> 5376.68s]  A lot of sad faces in here. And no what about Otto? Got the worst emote on Twitch. It's currently
[5376.68s -> 5381.86s]  rolled up. That's good. There's somebody's doodle of umjammer Lammy from that stream.
[5382.87s -> 5388.33s]  Pretty good. I like the fact that it's just a folded next part of your scrapbook there.
[5393.37s -> 5397.37s]  I need to make a face like this because that's like a really good image to have for a planet.
[5397.37s -> 5410.41s]  Pretty good uh pretty good Lammy. Floating in outer space. Lammy emote. Oh emote? Yeah let's
[5410.41s -> 5414.42s]  make this an emote. When it gets that small you can just see. It's just a piece of paper at that
[5414.42s -> 5425.26s]  point. It should be German notebook. Good shit. Uh this is the quote that uh a senior yearbook
[5425.26s -> 5432.50s]  quote. Uh I was taken out of context for this one but we'll read it anyways. This is uh keep
[5432.50s -> 5436.90s]  your eyes on the prize. The road to success is always under construction. Pretty fucking goddamn
[5436.90s -> 5443.22s]  good if you ask me. Boring boring boring boring boring boring. That's what my mother used to say
[5443.22s -> 5448.34s]  to me. That's a that's a quote from my mother. You what are you why are you going to make fun
[5448.34s -> 5453.88s]  of my mother? Are you making fun of my mother? Mrs. Albertson huh? I didn't say end quote.
[5457.03s -> 5464.63s]  That'd be a really really strange quote. I don't think that would be I don't I think there's like
[5464.63s -> 5472.71s]  a Twitter amount of characters you can have in your senior quote. It's like under 150 characters.
[5473.27s -> 5483.32s]  I don't think this one would fly. And then here we go. Uh remember the last time we had somebody
[5483.32s -> 5490.02s]  give an interesting Imgur gallery of their created characters from Soul Calibur. They have some more.
[5490.66s -> 5497.74s]  So this first one is uh grandpa. Grandpa entered the ring with a kendo stick. His doctor said
[5497.74s -> 5502.06s]  to not participate due to heart problems but fuck that. Watch out for this crazy old bastard.
[5504.10s -> 5511.30s]  Pretty good. There's uh the ring master. Straight from the carnival comes the victim
[5511.30s -> 5515.70s]  of chat abuse himself. He had to change from his glue man shirt to his night sky shirt after a
[5515.70s -> 5525.53s]  dunk tank issue. He's weak against wind type and frog type. That wind was nuts. I'm surprised that
[5525.53s -> 5532.22s]  half of this stuff is even in the game. Do you can you bring in custom images into Soul Calibur 6?
[5535.67s -> 5547.62s]  You can? No. So how did you do the planets here? They're very clearly there's planets right there.
[5548.26s -> 5558.20s]  Or is it like a sun? Is that just really really good replacement of something? It was kind of
[5558.20s -> 5565.80s]  hard but they're all suns. Oh all right. That's still really cool though. This demon grandpa
[5567.61s -> 5573.14s]  from Jerma Rumble Live and he's the scythe. That's awesome. Oh there's a Louie Anderson.
[5573.70s -> 5597.78s]  Is it just a nightmare? There's Jex. Can you tell I like that shirt? That's pretty close too.
[5598.58s -> 5612.36s]  Jerma Louie. Holy shit he's here. He's here right now. There's the egg. Everybody loves the egg.
[5612.36s -> 5617.72s]  The egg the egg has okay you know when a character steals the show but they were
[5617.72s -> 5624.02s]  a cameo and they were on screen for like only like three minutes. It's like the egg has like a
[5624.02s -> 5635.35s]  collective like 0.0002 percent screen time but people just love him. He's great. This is good.
[5636.68s -> 5649.56s]  Jerma Craft. That's so that's so works perfectly. It's perfect.
[5656.17s -> 5660.01s]  Here comes the coffee pasta of course. I wouldn't have it any other way.
[5663.80s -> 5671.00s]  And then here is HHH the headless the horseless headless horseman from TF2.
[5673.74s -> 5684.76s]  There's a Tertemus. You even got the like the cage right. Do I I really should probably play
[5684.76s -> 5691.66s]  this game for like an hour just to play it. There's a 30s milkman. There's Star. He ain't
[5691.66s -> 5704.20s]  that jacked. He's not that jacked. Look at that arm. He shrank that a little like 30 percent.
[5705.48s -> 5715.96s]  Unrealistic. Demon Lord Xeroxos with the you got the sweater. Oh my god.
[5717.93s -> 5728.97s]  The apple. It's just a turtle shell but it works. See the mind of a creator of a character creator.
[5728.97s -> 5734.10s]  You got it. You make those sacrifices. You make those compromises to figure out how to get the
[5734.10s -> 5744.30s]  character to work on camera. Good fucking work. Seriously this is like yep you get it. Oh you get
[5744.30s -> 5769.14s]  it. Pinwheel. Papyrus. Jesus. There we go. Fireman. You can paint too. Captain Crunch.
[5771.42s -> 5777.34s]  Giant rat. It's just got this nose. There's like what is it like there's a there's a monitor lizard
[5777.34s -> 5790.26s]  character in Soul Calibur. That's that's what I want. This is what I want in my house. That's
[5790.26s -> 5796.04s]  awesome. This Sonic the Hedgehog and you fight with a ring. Of course you do.
[5796.92s -> 5809.42s]  Super Jex. Super Jex is just barely bigger and stronger than Star. These are all so good and
[5809.42s -> 5814.30s]  then of course I don't think you can watermark Soul Calibur characters but these were made by
[5814.30s -> 5825.22s]  gnarly 62. Good shit. These were fantastic. That's my favorite. Just shows what you have
[5825.22s -> 5833.67s]  just shows what you're willing to be able to do to get what you want on screen. The apple.
[5833.67s -> 5841.26s]  All right let's keep going. WWE superstar Roman Reigns reviews wrestling scenes in movies. Vanity
[5841.26s -> 5854.65s]  Fair. Oh there's context to this one. This is I think my bitrate dropped to like 500 one day
[5856.62s -> 5862.23s]  and then somebody posted this image and everybody thought it was real.
[5873.62s -> 5884.92s]  It was. I mean it was. This is not a real image. This one's real yeah because I remember looking
[5884.92s -> 5894.54s]  over at chat and everyone was like your bitrate is fucked but this one is a edit. Get this on a
[5894.54s -> 5908.47s]  mug. Good stuff. Oh here's the official from apple shift. This is I think we looked at this the other
[5908.47s -> 5916.86s]  day but we'll look at it again. This is from 2k20 I think. Pretty accurate. Let's get let's get let
[5916.86s -> 5932.26s]  me set up a little bit here. Good stuff. That beautiful hair too. It's almost as good as mine.
[5933.22s -> 5940.54s]  Mine's okay. That's the full tire. Mine's like the flat tire but it's the same. It's the same tire.
[5940.54s -> 5955.42s]  That one has a little more air in it. What is this? This is this is a sandwich. Is this a picture of
[5955.42s -> 5976.95s]  a snake? I think it's supposed to be me. Is that my eyes? I think that's me. You don't remember the
[5976.95s -> 5987.16s]  snake. No not new. We already have this as an emote. This is somebody made the emote in real life.
[5987.24s -> 6006.92s]  This is Bogdanoff, Germany. Good shit. Me as the joker again. And it's that same image. I can see it
[6006.92s -> 6012.47s]  from a mile away. You can always tell because of the eye. One eye goes right completely forward.
[6012.47s -> 6017.75s]  The other guy the other one guy goes this way. One guy okay. One eye is normal. The other eye is
[6018.39s -> 6025.03s]  buried into the socket and going this way. I can always tell when it's in that image.
[6025.99s -> 6032.84s]  You know which one I'm talking about. Oh and like the whole face too. It's pretty good though.
[6032.84s -> 6047.83s]  Nice stuff. I I've had this movie spoiled for me. What? That's not good. And Shito. Very good
[6047.83s -> 6059.91s]  Shito. Very clean. A very clean Shito. The happy face with the little sheen on the top. It's
[6059.91s -> 6076.02s]  beautiful. It is beautiful. It's got good lighting. Yeah it does. Good shading. Give me a watermark.
[6076.02s -> 6082.95s]  Give me a watermark down here. Gotta give me that watermark. Otherwise like otherwise like who made
[6082.95s -> 6089.80s]  this? Could be anybody. Give me that watermark. Up here. Down here. Right here. Just right there.
[6089.80s -> 6107.40s]  Small. And I'm gonna zoom in. You'll see it. It's fucking fantastic. It's fantastic. I love it. I
[6107.40s -> 6119.50s]  love this one too. This is with pencil. Pencil smudges and shit doesn't it? Do you use cloth
[6119.50s -> 6127.16s]  when you do this? I can imagine. Okay hear me out on this. When you are drawing something,
[6127.16s -> 6133.56s]  doesn't matter what it is. If you have pencil, pen. When I okay let's say I draw a circle or
[6133.56s -> 6137.16s]  even if I'm writing like a check or something. You write out whatever it is you're writing
[6137.72s -> 6142.20s]  and then there has to be more done to what you're doing and you put like your hand and arm on the
[6142.20s -> 6147.88s]  paper and you like lift up and like your sweat from your arm has ruined the picture and like
[6147.88s -> 6154.41s]  smudged it and smeared the ink and smeared the the graphite and how do you how do you do stuff
[6154.41s -> 6164.01s]  this detailed without like resting your like whole fucking body on the table? It must be so difficult
[6164.01s -> 6168.42s]  to do that because think about it. If you if let's say you you were working right here right?
[6170.12s -> 6175.48s]  You have this whole area down here that could be smudged by your hand and wrist and arm.
[6176.12s -> 6180.01s]  You put paper under your hand. Do you really just like put like a towel or like a paper or
[6180.01s -> 6185.86s]  something on underneath? You paper on top of the drawing and then you kind of slide it down while
[6185.86s -> 6196.57s]  you work. That's cool. They wear a hazmat suit. That's cool. You're drawing. Why are you sweating?
[6198.68s -> 6205.29s]  I've run hot. I'm one of those people and you're gonna know what I mean when I talk about this.
[6206.97s -> 6212.73s]  You know when you are in the car like let's say you pick up somebody or you're you know it has
[6212.73s -> 6218.17s]  to be fairly cold for this to work too. So I'm the person that gets in the car during like a
[6218.17s -> 6225.77s]  40-50 degree day and after about five minutes the windows start to fog because I'm in the car.
[6226.41s -> 6240.39s]  It happens every fucking time. That happens to me. Good right and I know it's me but I don't you
[6240.39s -> 6245.91s]  don't say anything. What if I go oh sorry guys I uh I have like the internal temperature of
[6245.91s -> 6253.03s]  fucking thanksgiving turkey. Sorry. I just see the corners start to fog up because I got in the car
[6255.54s -> 6259.86s]  and then I just sit there and I go oh whatever I'm just I'm just in your car
[6260.76s -> 6264.44s]  and they know because there's two other people here. There's two other people in the back seat
[6264.44s -> 6269.35s]  and this the car was not fogged up. I got in close the door. Windows are up. Let's go.
[6269.35s -> 6276.38s]  Here we go. We're going down the road. Fog. Well that's weird. This didn't happen for any other
[6276.38s -> 6281.56s]  reason. Just open a window. Yeah that and you crack no but if you if you crack the window
[6281.56s -> 6288.31s]  if I go just so it goes down like a half an inch and let out all like the fucking human steam
[6289.19s -> 6295.48s]  everybody knows that it's I did that. Why do you think I fucking why I think I'm always naked?
[6296.12s -> 6302.06s]  Well that's a little weird that you never have clothes on when you're streaming. Yeah because
[6302.06s -> 6311.29s]  like I'm I weigh like a thousand degrees and that's right I said weigh because it's heavy.
[6313.94s -> 6320.81s]  Anyways if I were to draw this I would lift up and this would look all nice and this would be
[6320.81s -> 6330.92s]  as if it was like a three-year-old with watercolors just smearing their hand all over the paper. I'm
[6331.00s -> 6346.14s]  just I run hot. He's melting. What did you do in your art minor? I don't know. I got like a bunch
[6346.14s -> 6357.74s]  of clay and hit a baseball bat 20 times and then like I gave it eyes and a mouth and it was just
[6357.74s -> 6367.72s]  like another face. Great. I just saw that happen in real time. I forget that people can just press
[6367.72s -> 6378.44s]  the button. I always forget that that like yeah this is live. Remember I grew up with like TiVo
[6378.44s -> 6384.74s]  was like a thing that just came out. I was like 18. I was like probably 20 when TiVo was like a
[6384.74s -> 6398.12s]  thing that at first came out. Click on the link. Never. I'll never click on the link. Look at how
[6398.12s -> 6413.98s]  awesome this is. This is somebody made a plush toy of that dude fireman. Merch, merch, sell it,
[6413.98s -> 6419.82s]  sell it, sell it, sell it. Now you can't just sell everything. I can't just I can't just sell
[6419.82s -> 6428.97s]  everything guys. Like you can't. No no I don't I don't like no no no I'm not I'm not going
[6428.97s -> 6451.08s]  corporate. Had to reply. I'm not going corporate. You're the greedy grinner. All right fine. We're
[6451.08s -> 6466.02s]  going corporate. This is fantastic though seriously. It's just love went into this you can tell. Very
[6466.02s -> 6481.69s]  very good job and we are all currently looking at him. Something's gonna be bopping real soon
[6486.36s -> 6490.20s]  and like I'm weirdly drinking that because like I know you're watching me.
[6490.20s -> 6495.64s]  It's the same thing like a being on the date. Like you I I know you're watching me drink this so I'm
[6495.64s -> 6513.03s]  like get this on BTTV. This is not mine. I didn't make this and none of you made this either.
[6519.26s -> 6534.98s]  Just yoink it. Anybody yoink this? No this ain't mine. I didn't make this. Yeah nobody did. That's
[6535.06s -> 6552.25s]  really cool though. Boom. Here's the B. If no one made it then you can claim that it's yours.
[6552.25s -> 6563.83s]  That's not how that works. I like how how like jacked I am. Sometimes I think about how big and
[6563.83s -> 6570.47s]  strong I used to be and I go damn imagine if I was like that still and then I go no
[6571.51s -> 6579.21s]  because that took like five days a week every single fucking week. Constant constant care every
[6579.21s -> 6588.14s]  day for like two or three hours a day. It takes a lot especially when you're my size and I don't
[6588.14s -> 6596.38s]  mean that as like a I mean that as like a when you're like under like five ten when you're like five
[6597.18s -> 6605.74s]  eight five nine and below it's hard to keep on fucking like 160 170 pounds. It's hard to do that
[6608.74s -> 6614.44s]  especially when you have metabolism like I do. Those of you guys that are under six feet like
[6614.44s -> 6621.93s]  under five ten five eleven and you have like like fast metabolisms you putting weight on is
[6622.73s -> 6637.40s]  impossible. It was a full-time job for me to keep an extra 25 pounds on. Damn. Just eat forehead.
[6638.20s -> 6649.85s]  Oh I did. I was eating tuna out of the can just right out of the can just as a snack in between
[6649.85s -> 6667.91s]  meals like a fucking cat. I just turn upside down onto a plate and I would eat it or I wouldn't I
[6667.91s -> 6676.79s]  would just open it and eat it out of the fucking can. That's nasty. I did what I had to do to get
[6676.79s -> 6685.51s]  strong. You know how much protein I'm looking you right in the eye. Do you know how much protein is
[6685.59s -> 6700.46s]  packed in tuna fish sir or ma'am? You look pretty full right now. I do not I've lost I I have I have
[6700.46s -> 6713.19s]  lost like 20 pounds since 2012. I was like 170 in like 2012. I was a I was a fucking cement brick
[6713.19s -> 6724.06s]  of a fucking man. Seriously I was oh I was just made out of cement and then I just you know
[6725.40s -> 6731.40s]  stopped. I started going less and less. Started my priorities started changing and I'm sorry I
[6731.40s -> 6736.22s]  just bumped you. Sorry I bumped you again. Now he's a little squishy. Yeah you get a little older too
[6736.22s -> 6746.02s]  and it's it gets harder to do. Contrary to popular belief I think once you cross like 30 35 years old
[6746.02s -> 6752.36s]  it's kind of hard to at least for me it was hard to like get to the gym like four days a week five
[6752.36s -> 6759.69s]  days a week and like lift. I just was like it's like kind of not what I want to do right now.
[6763.06s -> 6770.50s]  Jesus you're old I thought you were 32. Keep thinking that. Now we'll be 32 up here for a
[6770.50s -> 6779.19s]  long time. Down here though from here down it's like a turtle shell. As long as I just keep a
[6779.19s -> 6796.54s]  fucking long sleeve shirt on and a turtleneck on I'll be good. Excuses. Hold on a minute hold on let
[6796.54s -> 6808.78s]  me let me drink the rest of my life like water and cigarette ashes. He's fragile now he is. I'm not
[6808.78s -> 6816.10s]  going to tell you that I'm not. Here's a an album apparently that I am. Albertson the debut album.
[6816.66s -> 6827.88s]  Did you take this from eBay? Oh like this is an eBay photo right? Like this is an eBay photo
[6827.88s -> 6837.99s]  that you that you yoinked. I mean it's I get this is like pretty good like editing wise.
[6838.63s -> 6849.91s]  Parental advisory oh yeah I can't listen to that. No he's just saying yoink now. I don't think it's
[6849.91s -> 6858.79s]  edited. What are you talking? No no of course not. It's wait it's printed. Somebody printed this.
[6858.79s -> 6883.96s]  No they didn't. Did you? It's printed. Well let's hear it. What's in there? What's the CD?
[6884.76s -> 6904.07s]  And there it is. The first album I ever did apparently. Something of a scientist. Nice.
[6907.13s -> 6917.72s]  Oh look at this. Lots of fireman stuff. I love it. Now this in particular. We got the one guy in
[6917.72s -> 6929.94s]  there. Got the slug. What else is in here? He got the watermark. Beautiful. This is great too. What
[6929.94s -> 6943.96s]  else is in here? My favorite emote is in here. That emote will never be deleted. Term of chomp
[6945.45s -> 6960.47s]  is the Saturn. All neatly packed into fireman's face. Fantastic. Very good with the
[6962.34s -> 6966.58s]  switching between. I'm not even going to pretend like I'm going to like talk about how what I
[6967.06s -> 6975.34s]  think. It looks good. I make myself probably sound stupider and stupider the more that I talk about
[6976.22s -> 6985.75s]  the line work. It just looks great. But I like what you did with the white on the outside.
[6985.75s -> 6989.11s]  It really makes it come out of the image. It separates it from the paper enough
[6989.91s -> 6998.94s]  where it almost looks like a 3D image. You said my piece. You got an A. This is me scared.
[6999.66s -> 7011.86s]  He's an art major. Why does Jex have to be like three inches taller than me? That's not fair.
[7011.86s -> 7019.69s]  We're the same person. If anything, Jex should be smaller because Jex is like a spirit that
[7019.69s -> 7030.84s]  comes out of me and goes in and out. Shouldn't they be like a spirit that's like smaller? What
[7030.84s -> 7046.42s]  do you mean stand? He's stronger. Stand. Like you want me to stand up. I don't understand. I don't
[7046.42s -> 7054.06s]  know what that means. It's a JoJo reference. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know that everything
[7054.06s -> 7065.06s]  that was pink and blue is a JoJo reference. I didn't know that. I just I thought this is me.
[7065.06s -> 7090.06s]  No, this is me. This is me and Jex. I know what this is. He doesn't get it. A stand is a some like
[7090.06s -> 7099.46s]  a summoned person. That's the worst noise of 2008 and 19. No, it's not. Bullshit. Bugle Boy
[7099.46s -> 7104.74s]  screaming into the urn is the worst noise ever on this channel. That happened like three weeks
[7104.74s -> 7111.91s]  ago. There's no contest. There will not be a contest for that because that will beat it every
[7111.91s -> 7127.58s]  time. Bugle Boy is like jeans. Bugle Berry. Bugle Boy. Bugle Boy is like clothes from the 90s.
[7130.23s -> 7137.19s]  Bugle Berry screaming into the urn is the worst noise I've ever made while live on this channel.
[7140.02s -> 7147.66s]  Son of Bugle Berry. Bugle Boy. Streaming hot. Streaming cheesy.
[7148.62s -> 7159.26s]  Cluck cluck is just cheesy chicken. New character. Bugle. I think this clip is too quiet. Hold on.
[7160.89s -> 7166.15s]  I'm going to warn you. I have not heard this in like three weeks. I'm going to play something
[7166.15s -> 7184.34s]  very loud right now. So I'm sorry, everybody. I need to hear what this sounds like. That's not it.
[7185.80s -> 7194.74s]  This is so much reverb. I was fucking shitting myself laughing at this
[7194.74s -> 7203.99s]  because the reverb is insane. It's insane. I didn't know it was this much reverb.
[7207.10s -> 7221.24s]  Did you guys know that during this segment? Okay, listen, this is real. We're talking real talk
[7221.24s -> 7227.94s]  right now. I don't know if we talked about this already, but we may have. During that stream at
[7227.94s -> 7234.58s]  about 8,000 to 9,000 concurrent viewers watching, there was like 8,700 people watching before we got
[7234.58s -> 7245.62s]  to Bugle Berry. When Bugle Berry came on screen, almost 3,000 people left. It was like a catastrophe
[7245.62s -> 7254.92s]  of viewers dropping. It was so hard to fucking not laugh at that. Oh my God.
[7256.92s -> 7263.72s]  Everything that I saw was like, dude, it's so loud and I can't hear fucking anything.
[7272.57s -> 7278.25s]  When I watched clips of this, there it is. There's the eep. This is going to be really loud.
[7279.59s -> 7286.44s]  Loud, a loud warning coming up. Very loud. Seriously, I'm not kidding around. This is
[7286.44s -> 7295.74s]  going to be very loud. When I was told, hey dude, we dropped like 3,000 viewers,
[7295.74s -> 7320.74s]  I was just like, are you fucking serious? Oh my God. Holy shit. Oh my fucking God. That's so bad.
[7323.13s -> 7328.09s]  Holy shit. That's fucking loud. I can see it on the monitor.
[7330.47s -> 7351.48s]  There's more? 3,000 people left. If you want something funny about that stream,
[7351.48s -> 7357.56s]  I'll give you another little tidbit of information. No joke. My actual reel, my mother
[7357.56s -> 7364.55s]  watched that stream and she said she watched it all. Right? So I'm just sitting there going,
[7364.55s -> 7372.15s]  holy shit. And she didn't say anything about Bugle Berry. The slime part was really funny.
[7372.15s -> 7380.31s]  Wow, that was really interesting. Oh, thanks, mom. The trivia was really funny. She didn't skip
[7380.31s -> 7391.14s]  the middle 22 minutes of Bugle Berry. She even turned it off. Mom saw you in a diaper.
[7392.82s -> 7398.68s]  My mother saw me in a diaper when I was two, okay? Who cares? This is great, by the way.
[7436.06s -> 7441.38s]  This is why we have to vet submissions. That was up for a very long time.
[7442.34s -> 7451.82s]  It's okay. No, it didn't even say what you think it did. It said whatever. Okay, this is sticks.
[7451.82s -> 7457.42s]  This is Sticks Renegade saying, Sticks, I'm going to draw your fursona. I said it like four years
[7457.42s -> 7478.92s]  ago and I just never did. I never did it. And spoiler alert, I never will. Reapplication.
[7478.92s -> 7483.48s]  Because I will butcher it. You're not going to like it. You're not going to like it. I'm telling
[7483.48s -> 7486.04s]  you, you think you want that, but then you're going to get it and you're going to be like,
[7486.04s -> 7496.97s]  this is so bad. And it'll turn into merch. That's right. Chat will never let you forget this,
[7496.97s -> 7501.85s]  Jeremy. And this is breaking news. The drawstrings of my pants just flopped directly into the urinal.
[7501.85s -> 7505.21s]  What the fuck do I even do now? I've been walking around like I'm wearing a diaper
[7505.21s -> 7513.90s]  because I don't want the drawstrings to touch me. I don't care. That's fine. That's a real problem
[7513.90s -> 7519.91s]  that people can have. If you're wearing comfy pants and you go into a bathroom and you pull
[7519.91s -> 7523.91s]  your comfy pants down and your underwear down to pee into the urinal and then you have these
[7524.63s -> 7530.23s]  long fucking strings that are like this long and they just went into the fucking urinal.
[7531.35s -> 7538.63s]  And what do I do now? What are you supposed to do? What do you do? You pull your pants down at
[7538.63s -> 7549.98s]  a urinal. No. Did you hear what I said before that? If you're wearing comfy pants that don't
[7549.98s -> 7556.14s]  have the hole that's in the middle of the pants, what do you do? Just pee through your pants?
[7556.78s -> 7564.97s]  How are you supposed to go to the bathroom if you have like comfy pants on that do not have the
[7564.97s -> 7577.38s]  hole in the middle? Why do people think I'm talking about like dropping my pants to my ankles like
[7577.38s -> 7595.64s]  butters from South Park? What? Just use a stall. That was like a shit in there. No, I'm not doing
[7595.64s -> 7601.35s]  stall. I'm not doing stall roulette. If you go to a very, very public bathroom with a bunch of people
[7601.35s -> 7608.76s]  in it, people, you never know which one's going to have a person in it. Look, if there's like six
[7608.84s -> 7616.68s]  or seven stalls and there's like 40 people in 30 people in here, I don't know who's in there
[7625.99s -> 7629.51s]  to lock. I don't know, but you don't want to walk up to a closed stall and be like,
[7629.51s -> 7635.83s]  go, go, go, go. Oh shit. Hey, I'm in here. No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'll try the next one.
[7644.63s -> 7651.43s]  Look, no. What? Is somebody in there? No, cause stall. I'm talking. Look, I'm not talking about,
[7655.66s -> 7661.74s]  they need to do, and this is an American bathroom problem because everyone's like,
[7661.74s -> 7665.74s]  what are you talking about? When you go to, when you go on an airplane, listen to me,
[7665.74s -> 7668.78s]  this is so important. This is the most important thing I'm going to talk about all day. When you
[7668.78s -> 7676.46s]  go to an airport and you go in an airplane and there's bathrooms there, right? When you go in
[7676.46s -> 7681.34s]  and you close the door and you hit the little switch, a little fucking light is on. Just,
[7681.34s -> 7688.71s]  it just says that somebody's in it. No, no stalls in America have anything like that.
[7689.27s -> 7695.51s]  Only some of them do. For the most part, American toilets are like three pieces of sheet metal
[7696.07s -> 7704.18s]  that just sit hovering over the, off the ground and a lock that barely even goes forward enough
[7704.18s -> 7709.02s]  to lock the door. So if you want me to open a stall, if I don't know if somebody's in there,
[7709.02s -> 7717.27s]  the door's not actually locked. It will open. It's just, it's enough to just not have the door do
[7717.27s -> 7721.51s]  the stupid fucking thing that it does every time. When you go into a stall and you close the door
[7721.51s -> 7725.91s]  behind you, it just opens again. And you're like, get the fuck away from me. And then you,
[7725.91s -> 7732.63s]  that's enough to make it so the door doesn't hover back and hit you. Have stalls, let it go all the
[7732.63s -> 7740.86s]  way down. They don't have holes, huge gaps in the corners and make it so when you actually latch it,
[7740.86s -> 7746.06s]  there's a little light. It just has to be a fucking like 30 cent red and green LEDs.
[7746.06s -> 7764.17s]  Have it just be red or fucking green. Why is that so hard? It's easy. No joke, you're right about
[7764.17s -> 7768.97s]  this. Yeah, we've been doing toilet, we've been doing public bathrooms so incorrect in the United
[7768.97s -> 7776.82s]  States for like 60 years. We're just all peeing into walls and like standing behind fucking bricks
[7776.82s -> 7784.98s]  of sheet metal. If I designed a bathroom, I would, I would probably win an award. I would win awards
[7784.98s -> 7789.96s]  for this. It's not going to be expensive. It could be more, it could be cheaper than it is now.
[7793.72s -> 7799.48s]  No, I just talked about urinals. I never talked about stalls. Do what airplanes do. It makes
[7799.48s -> 7804.76s]  everyone so much more secure. You don't have to fucking worry about like the gaps in the fucking
[7804.76s -> 7811.64s]  stalls. Light, LED, red. I know that ones don't go in that one. That one is, is green. Now,
[7811.64s -> 7817.00s]  if you went into a stall and you didn't put on the fucking light that's red and it's green and
[7817.96s -> 7823.51s]  you got to fucking be aware of that. Okay. That's, that's a, that's a you problem.
[7823.51s -> 7833.14s]  You got to, if it's, if it's green, it means it's vacant. Otherwise you get into a problem there.
[7833.14s -> 7838.49s]  That's the one issue, but it'll be locked anyways. No, no, no. Cause you would do the thing to the
[7838.49s -> 7843.58s]  airplane. You do think the airplanes do when it's locked, it's red. Done. I'll take a hundred million
[7843.58s -> 7852.38s]  dollars in a grant please to redo every bathroom in fucking America. This already exists. Yes,
[7852.38s -> 7860.30s]  it does. It does already exist on porta-potties. So porta-potties in the United States are better
[7860.30s -> 7868.41s]  than bathrooms in fucking public places that may have cost a hundred to $200,000 to make.
[7868.41s -> 7885.40s]  A like $89 plastic box is better. I had to defend myself on this. $200,000 bathroom.
[7885.40s -> 7889.00s]  How much do you think toilets are? How much do you think those stalls cost? How much do you think
[7889.00s -> 7895.51s]  every sink is? It's like a hundred fucking grant, 200 grand to make like a full like 20 toilet
[7895.51s -> 7906.78s]  bathroom. Nice. Hey, somebody just gave, uh, that was modest narcissist five community subs. Thank
[7906.78s -> 7917.64s]  you. Modest narcissist. Appreciate it. Thank you. German has never been to a construction site
[7917.64s -> 7928.86s]  porta-potty. No guys. I don't like, I don't like go pull over on the side of the road to like,
[7928.86s -> 7936.34s]  go use the bathroom at like the construction yard. I don't do that. Oh, I let me go to the
[7936.34s -> 7941.72s]  bathroom. That, that seems like a good one. Uh, German sucks. Thanks for five community subs.
[7941.72s -> 7949.66s]  Tingy five community subs. Thank you. Like three or four back to back to back to back five subs.
[7949.66s -> 7959.42s]  Thanks guys. You're just too good for the common man's bathroom. I'm trying to improve the common
[7959.42s -> 7970.71s]  man's bathroom. I'm trying to improve it and make it better for everybody. What? Don't use my
[7970.71s -> 7992.76s]  lightning hands. German 2020. Uh, no. Hey, there's baby boy, baby boy, baby boy. Being back Sonic.
[7998.36s -> 8005.30s]  I do that face. I have a urinal installed in my house. Bathrooms are overrated. That actually
[8005.30s -> 8015.64s]  would be kind of cool. I mean, it sounds like you got a lot of money. This is great though. Thank
[8015.64s -> 8025.80s]  you, uh, eternal for this beautiful profile picture esque being back Sonic. It's fantastic.
[8026.36s -> 8043.19s]  How do I shit in public bathroom? We're not going to get started on this. People are going to think
[8043.19s -> 8065.46s]  I'm insane. This is German lemur. There's like two or three of these in a row. Hey, there's a
[8067.16s -> 8078.30s]  German Naruto. I like the style. I still don't understand what they were thinking with this hat
[8078.30s -> 8084.71s]  though, with the hair. How would, cause you don't pull it down all the way. That's supposed to be
[8084.71s -> 8095.98s]  a headband, right? This is really good, uh, pencil work, pen work, whatever it is. It's very thin.
[8096.70s -> 8102.81s]  It just goes under the hair. Yeah. But if I pull that down, that was sitting on the top of my head,
[8102.81s -> 8108.06s]  like all the way up to the top. If I had pulled that down, the top part would have gone over my
[8108.06s -> 8116.20s]  eyes. I was like balancing that like on the top of my forehead. Good. What do you mean good?
[8119.67s -> 8128.15s]  You have a small skull. I know that's okay though, but no, this is great. Thank you for this.
[8128.95s -> 8136.47s]  And we also have, uh, this is from the slime stream. That's me. I believe this is me.
[8137.19s -> 8156.09s]  That was not me driving by. So there we are. Distraught. That's a kind of a blurry photo though.
[8162.73s -> 8170.70s]  What? Worm? What? Wormy? What is wormy? What do you mean? What do you, wait, what do you mean?
[8170.70s -> 8184.63s]  What is that word? This is cool though. I'm a boomer. I don't, I don't know what that is.
[8186.38s -> 8194.36s]  It's a Splatoon thing. Oh, okay. Oh, all right. I get it. Have I ever played Splatoon? Maybe like
[8194.36s -> 8200.06s]  for an hour. Oh, okay. So this is like a Splatoon character or something. Oh, all right. Now it
[8200.06s -> 8213.82s]  makes sense. Now it makes sense. Splatoon. Very cool. Uh, Jeremy Elbertson breaks down his career
[8213.82s -> 8226.47s]  from the rat movie to Spider-Man, Vanity Fair. There's a little GIF involved us playing trivia.
[8229.37s -> 8235.56s]  German in 10 years. More like German in 40 years. I'll still have this face. This face
[8235.56s -> 8242.68s]  ain't going anywhere. No, I eat way, I take way too much olive oil and way too much garlic and
[8242.68s -> 8258.74s]  avocado oil for this face to turn anywhere. I'm sorry. Dr. Schmikeson on the right. Minus two
[8258.74s -> 8270.18s]  for me. I had more points than that. Sorry. I had way more points than that. BRB, stop streaming
[8270.18s -> 8281.62s]  for a second. I need to go shit in my urinal. Oh, Dunkin Donuts because you're cool. This is,
[8281.62s -> 8293.94s]  look at this. Now that's what I call a good photo. All right. Here's, here's what I would change.
[8293.94s -> 8302.25s]  Okay. Get rid of the, uh, the don't sue me branding. Maybe a couple of little ice cubes
[8302.97s -> 8309.45s]  and what's that like steam coming out like up here because it's cooling them off, but it's fire.
[8310.97s -> 8320.52s]  This is fucking amazing. Not out of his ass, like up like, like like little smoke.
[8320.52s -> 8330.07s]  This is fantastic work. I love this because this is what I do. This is just me every day.
[8331.21s -> 8340.76s]  I just not Dunkin Donuts anymore. He has to say Dunk. I'm not saying that it's Dunkin Donuts
[8340.84s -> 8347.62s]  is the name of the store that you get this coffee from. I'm not going to say it. He hates it. Why
[8347.62s -> 8356.68s]  would I hate this? What I just said, it was my like, I like this one. I can't play favorites
[8356.68s -> 8363.46s]  because they're all, all of these are my wonderful children. I can't play favorites on them. He's a
[8363.46s -> 8372.86s]  liar. I hesitated because I didn't want to say favorite. It's great. Thank you for this. And
[8374.25s -> 8382.57s]  you got the CB BB cold blue, cold brew blueberry. You want the best coffee from Dunkin Donuts?
[8383.51s -> 8391.75s]  Cold brew ice coffee with blueberry. That does not say what you're saying in chat. Hate to break
[8391.75s -> 8406.14s]  it to you. Ah, this is me as the giant rat. It seems equal parts is terrifying and interesting.
[8412.71s -> 8417.43s]  You just, did you say the blueberry flavor at Dunkin Donuts is the worst, most disgusting flavor?
[8421.02s -> 8428.26s]  Sometimes I think I'm an alien on earth. When I read stuff like this, I feel like I'm like
[8428.26s -> 8436.09s]  from another planet. I have to be. Blueberry is the worst flavor from Dunkin. What are you,
[8436.09s -> 8454.39s]  a hazelnut guy? Oh, blueberry tea is shit. I must be from fucking Jupiter. Very, very good.
[8454.39s -> 8464.42s]  Derma real life rat. Look at the claws. I even, I even have four fingers. You did your research.
[8468.95s -> 8486.49s]  This is a painting of the hyper cam. Very accurate. It looks great. That's from, yeah,
[8486.49s -> 8491.03s]  that's from condemned. Don't you wish you could go back and play a game again and wipe your brain
[8491.03s -> 8499.72s]  like we've talked about? I wish I could play condemned again. That game was so good, but this
[8499.72s -> 8509.54s]  is paint or is it, is it tape? Hold on a second. Is this paint or tape? I'm seeing like a little
[8509.54s -> 8516.44s]  bunch of bunching up here and like bunching up. Is this a plastic bag? Hold on. Look down here.
[8517.40s -> 8528.84s]  Is this like a plastic bag paint? No. Look at down here. Holy shit. Nice. It could be marker.
[8529.99s -> 8539.45s]  You're stupid. Sometimes I seriously think I'm fucking, like, I was dropped off here and like
[8539.45s -> 8553.42s]  somebody booted me up. No, you. No, this is awesome. I love it. Roach Ranch Zoo Resort off
[8553.42s -> 8562.46s]  of exit 78 said to close amidst money laundering allegations. Roach Ranch. Roach murder. Okay.
[8565.00s -> 8571.40s]  Roach Ranch was such a great place though. I love Roach Ranch and of course you got the
[8571.40s -> 8581.59s]  sign for Anthony for Anthony. You have to. I would love to go to like a bug zoo. People give bugs
[8581.59s -> 8587.35s]  such a bad rap. I mean, I hate them. They're disgusting. I really don't like bugs at all,
[8587.35s -> 8595.19s]  but like they get a bad rap because they're interesting. They're cool. They have like a
[8595.19s -> 8600.15s]  really, really, there's so many different species. There's so many different types of bugs and, and,
[8600.15s -> 8606.84s]  and what? Because like, yeah, I'm just saying the bugs have a bad rap. I'm included in this. I don't
[8606.84s -> 8623.61s]  like bugs. There are like three bugs that I like. Praying mantis, butterflies, and like stag beetles
[8625.72s -> 8640.06s]  and bees and ladybugs. Yeah, that's pretty much it. What about you? You killed a bee. No, I didn't.
[8641.14s -> 8651.38s]  Those were wasps. Wasps are fucking murderers. Did somebody just say same thing? Bee and wasp.
[8651.38s -> 8658.42s]  One of them is going to, is for the future of our planet and the other one kills for fun.
[8658.42s -> 8679.03s]  What are you talking about? Bad, that guy. Like hornets and wasps, they're like, they're murderers.
[8685.85s -> 8690.17s]  Hornets sometimes just, just destroy hives because they felt like it, bee hives,
[8690.17s -> 8702.65s]  and just take it over for fun. Wasp pollinate. Bees do justice. Bees do very, very good. Bumble bees,
[8702.65s -> 8719.19s]  honey bees, carpenter bees. There's wasps in chat. Hey, don't say that about us.
[8721.98s -> 8728.62s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I might punch you in the face when we come across each other on the street,
[8728.62s -> 8746.49s]  but I pay taxes. What's wrong with that? I might break in your house and like eat all your food
[8746.49s -> 8751.43s]  and like throw your fridge onto the ground, but I'm really good at fucking making pies.
[8752.07s -> 8766.44s]  Did you know that? Fucking wasps and hornets. They're mean. They're aggressive and they're angry
[8766.44s -> 8788.47s]  all the time. This is German Lego. This is great. And Nvidia Greg made this. The Lego hair is
[8788.47s -> 8819.64s]  perfect. The seagull, the skeleton. This really does look, okay. I look like a Lazy Town villain.
[8819.72s -> 8832.36s]  It's the hair. It's like that plastic-y kind of hair in the outfit. Yes, it's online thanks
[8832.36s -> 8847.03s]  to the five community subs. Yes. What would my gimmick be as a villain? I wouldn't have any
[8847.03s -> 8863.13s]  gimmicks. I don't have gimmicks. Boring. Yeah, I'm just, it's just me. I just have like funny hair.
[8866.22s -> 8873.77s]  I'm like every villain from all the Disney XD shows. Doesn't have any superpowers. Just dresses
[8873.77s -> 8885.43s]  up in costumes and like is kind of fucking annoying, right? Just gets in the way of
[8886.15s -> 8891.93s]  stuff that the main characters are doing. Happens to like pull the wrong lever,
[8891.93s -> 8903.59s]  like if I mess it up with my plan. Yeah, I wouldn't be a very good villain. Let's go.
[8905.24s -> 8908.52s]  Happy Thanksgiving. I hope you're hungry for some German turkey.
[8916.31s -> 8923.08s]  There's a lot of grapes and fruits. I don't eat very much fruit on Thanksgiving.
[8923.83s -> 8934.33s]  Look, there's apples in here. Tons of grapes. Apples. Oranges. Oranges. Oranges. Grapes.
[8936.46s -> 8943.22s]  I don't eat fruit on Thanksgiving. I mean squash. Yeah, I mean, but that's, I eat squash, corn,
[8944.10s -> 8953.05s]  green beans. I don't, apples on Thanksgiving. Like apple pie. Not like, who eats like grapes like
[8954.01s -> 8974.33s]  on fucking Thanksgiving. Do you guys do that? I've got to be. From Pluto. Nice work Dorkcube.
[8974.89s -> 8990.07s]  You got the facial hair really, really spot on because that's all that happens.
[8994.49s -> 9000.97s]  When I grow up my facial hair, it just looks like somebody took a stapler and just just went nuts
[9000.97s -> 9015.14s]  with it. It's not good. But this on the other hand, this is good. No emotion for two minutes.
[9015.14s -> 9019.29s]  Why would I do that? We're going over some great community art right now and then we're going to
[9019.29s -> 9026.23s]  go over community videos. Strap in for that one. We're almost done with this I think. Only a few
[9026.23s -> 9037.10s]  more. But good doodle. Good work. This is from the, I believe the Space Ace stream, which is really
[9037.10s -> 9055.18s]  cool. Or is this a JoJo reference? Space Ace. It is now. No, it's not. Cowboy Bebop. I just saw,
[9055.18s -> 9064.87s]  I saw the blue and I saw the like magenta. It's from neither. You guys got in my head here.
[9068.36s -> 9074.52s]  Everything, everything is JoJo if it's like brightly colored blue and magenta and like pink.
[9077.19s -> 9082.46s]  This is great though. There's the light gun. If you, by the way for some of the new viewers that
[9082.46s -> 9089.98s]  might be here that haven't been here for a while. In this shirt, mind you, in this shirt I did on
[9089.98s -> 9096.30s]  first try. I played light gun games which I'm very, very good at. First try I did the bonus round in
[9096.38s -> 9101.74s]  point blank, which is almost impossible to do. It is physically nearly impossible to complete it.
[9101.74s -> 9105.10s]  And I did it first try. That just, there's probably some new people here that don't know
[9105.10s -> 9118.50s]  my light gun skills. Humble brag. No, that was a regular brag. That was like bragging it to your
[9118.50s -> 9134.81s]  face. Awesome work though. And look at that. Good stuff. I like the glasses. I don't even have a
[9134.81s -> 9141.45s]  pair of glasses like this. I should probably get some then. I'm a new viewer and I don't believe
[9141.45s -> 9152.55s]  you. Somebody linked the clip. It's ridiculous. And then I fell out the window. That hurt. I like
[9152.55s -> 9161.40s]  the very, very nice glowing letters. It adds a lot. It does. No, not the haunted bugleberry 3000
[9161.40s -> 9171.91s]  people leave the stream noise. Now this is very interesting too. It's a nice suit. Is this, that's
[9171.91s -> 9181.48s]  the J. That's really cool. I didn't even know this was the J at first. And then that's me in a suit.
[9182.12s -> 9194.54s]  German 985. That's a Jojo stance, but whatever. That's how I stand. I actually do kind of stand
[9194.54s -> 9208.18s]  like that. I love it. You made the J this interesting, like Power Rangers villain.
[9208.18s -> 9226.70s]  That's awesome. He's my stand. You're such an old person. I haven't seen a television show.
[9228.92s -> 9240.78s]  This is not like required reading in high school. I haven't seen this TV show. Yes, it is. Yes,
[9240.78s -> 9246.54s]  it is. Well, all right. When your high school starts to have Jojo's Bizarre Adventure as required
[9246.54s -> 9256.30s]  reading, then we'll talk. TV wasn't even invented yet. Not yet. This is really well done though.
[9256.30s -> 9264.50s]  Is it like a heart monitor in the back? Like a, like a, what's that? One of those things.
[9265.06s -> 9276.36s]  It's really cool. This is me fat. Like really fat. This is kind of how I feel right now.
[9279.74s -> 9284.46s]  This is the clothes I wear every day. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What do you mean? Uh-oh.
[9285.67s -> 9298.58s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Stinky poopoo. What the fuck are you guys doing? Stinky poopoo? What are you guys
[9298.58s -> 9306.84s]  fucking doing? It's a, oh, it's called, it's, it's, oh, right. Okay. It's like a meme thing.
[9307.56s -> 9313.32s]  I look over it and I just see like a wave of people writing like, poopoo, stinky poopoo,
[9313.32s -> 9320.46s]  and shit. I'm just like, what the fuck is going on over here? Like, why did this happen?
[9323.72s -> 9327.88s]  No, I'm not watching meme video. All right. This is fucking fat Jeremy.
[9333.16s -> 9351.29s]  The Rumblers. The Compact War. Holy shit. Look at that. What is that? Is that beanbag? Is somebody
[9351.29s -> 9377.82s]  like in a beanbag Sonic? Is that like a cosplay? This is awesome. There's Dr. Jerma with the
[9377.82s -> 9387.29s]  Infinity Gauntlet. Anyway, there's Batboy, Pac-Man. They're all here. Everybody's here.
[9389.19s -> 9401.43s]  Infinity War. Marvel's Smash Brothers. Poster. Let's get it. Poster. Everybody knows what I'm
[9401.43s -> 9412.58s]  saying. Poster. There's a Glooman. Like a pixelated version of Glooman's face, like we do have on the
[9412.58s -> 9425.38s]  emote. Pretty, it's actually really good. I really like this. Watch it. Watch it. I'm not going to
[9425.38s -> 9438.70s]  watch the stinky poopoo video. I'm not going to watch it. Please. Please. I'm not going to watch
[9438.70s -> 9449.22s]  it. No. I'll watch it. I'll watch it later like in bed. You're going to unsubscribe because I won't
[9449.22s -> 9458.95s]  watch the uh-oh poopoo video. I don't know what to tell you on this one. I'll give you my review
[9458.95s -> 9467.18s]  next stream. It's cursed. I'll give you my review next stream. This is great though. Reminds me of
[9467.18s -> 9474.58s]  like a pixelated video game character. Unsubbing. I'm not going to... I don't want to watch this
[9474.58s -> 9490.31s]  video. We got so many other videos to watch. Do reactions. Reaction now. He's going to lose
[9490.31s -> 9495.90s]  3,000 viewers. No, I think I'll gain 3,000 viewers because I'm not going to watch that video.
[9496.63s -> 9500.63s]  Because as many people that are writing this right now that want me to click that video,
[9500.63s -> 9506.39s]  there's probably like two or three thousand people that are here still right now that don't want me
[9506.39s -> 9512.15s]  to watch it and will leave if I do. So what is it? What am I supposed to do here? Three thousand
[9512.15s -> 9514.95s]  people will leave if I don't click it and three thousand people will leave if I do.
[9515.83s -> 9528.52s]  What's the game plan here for me? Don't watch it. Damned if you do. Damned if you don't. Don't mind
[9528.52s -> 9538.01s]  if I don't. Oh all right. Everybody look what's on screen. The easiest way to make chat completely
[9538.01s -> 9553.80s]  just focus on... dog on screen. Dog on camera. Dog on camera. This is cute. He's so chunky.
[9553.88s -> 9559.78s]  He's like, you know, he's like a little black bear. That's what he looks like. He's so cute.
[9562.78s -> 9571.72s]  Yes, it's all love here with Otto. That's how I feel every morning. I just look at him and I'm
[9571.72s -> 9585.40s]  like, you're the best. He's my best friend. Show Otto the video. I'm going to print out a picture
[9585.40s -> 9595.16s]  of this video like a thumbnail of the video. I'm going to eat it on camera. This is very, very good.
[9595.80s -> 9599.82s]  I love this. You know who's going to love this? Kim would like this really, really. She like
[9599.82s -> 9607.00s]  loves drawings and pictures of Otto just like I do. This you probably go, what is this photo of?
[9607.00s -> 9620.15s]  Well, it's a photo of this. The coal miner. I still don't know why that even happened. That
[9620.15s -> 9633.64s]  was so strange. I feel like it was worse than this at some point too. It's football germa.
[9637.46s -> 9655.54s]  Look at that hair too. Look at that dusty hair. Somebody just wrote, do you guys have any idea
[9655.54s -> 9662.26s]  how annoying this must be for Jeremy to see this over and over again? They won't pestering him.
[9670.39s -> 9681.66s]  I will watch the first, I will listen to the first one second of this video. If it is not,
[9681.66s -> 9686.12s]  if it is not what I want, if I will click off of it, if I do not want to watch this.
[9686.76s -> 9705.32s]  Okay. Don't give in. You know what? Fuck it. I'm not giving in. It's true. All right. What's next?
[9706.28s -> 9714.01s]  Is there anything left? Hey, look at that. This is from the last stream. Bunch of psychos in this
[9714.01s -> 9724.41s]  mall. Erp. For the love of God, Frank, put on some shoes. This is great. This was like a few
[9724.41s -> 9736.33s]  days ago. Not all heroes wear capes. They just don't click poo poo videos. If that's the criteria
[9736.33s -> 9748.26s]  to be a hero, we've got a long way to go. Not all heroes wear shoes. Not all heroes wear shoes.
[9748.90s -> 9759.45s]  This is great. Thank you. Thank you, Multitrip. You did the watermark too. Good. And ladies and
[9759.45s -> 9788.06s]  gentlemen, there's one more. There's one more. This is just fucking crazy. Watch this. This is
[9788.06s -> 9794.58s]  what happens. You know what? It might seem like weird for you guys to see this, but this is the
[9794.58s -> 9806.09s]  type of technology that actually existed back in like NBA 2K 11. This is what it actually looked
[9806.09s -> 9816.89s]  like when you did this. Like NBA 2K, like 2009. It was this scary. But I don't even know how you
[9816.89s -> 9822.41s]  must've just mapped my... That horrible face is that same image. I'm not going to click on the ad
[9825.66s -> 9838.10s]  under any circumstance. Jesus. But that concludes the... I just clicked on the fucking ad accidentally,
[9838.10s -> 9846.98s]  didn't I? No, I didn't. Thank God. That concludes the images portion of the stream today. We're
[9846.98s -> 9851.54s]  going to move on to the videos. And we got a bunch of these. We have a lot to go through.
[9852.18s -> 9857.86s]  So I told you there was a lot this time. I wasn't lying. There was a shitload of images and there's
[9857.86s -> 9887.69s]  a shitload of videos too. I'm done. I'm not watching anymore. No, I'm done. I'm not watching
[9887.69s -> 9908.58s]  anymore of this. That was interesting. So first up, we've got... I need everyone to see this just
[9908.58s -> 9944.90s]  because this first one's called The Ring. It's called The Ring. I have to make myself a little
[9944.90s -> 9950.76s]  smaller because I don't want to get in the way of any of these videos because that's what we're here
[9950.76s -> 9954.20s]  for. We're here for the videos. And I also want to turn this way to be able to watch them with you.
[9954.92s -> 9963.58s]  Let's go this way. Sit here and make sure I'm in a good spot to view. I need a good viewing angle.
[9967.30s -> 9983.29s]  Okay, here we go. There's a videotape.
[10000.41s -> 10005.69s]  I went to a field trip today. The teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer.
[10006.41s -> 10025.48s]  That's the whole video. That's the whole video. It's not even... Again? You want to see it again?
[10025.56s -> 10027.88s]  Fine. We encores some of them.
[10051.48s -> 10056.76s]  I went to a field trip today. The teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer.
[10062.22s -> 10070.94s]  Why? But why The Ring? But why The Ring? That was The Ring.
[10073.30s -> 10078.18s]  Coming up next. You're gonna get flashed every time. I'm sorry. I'm gonna take a photo of you.
[10078.18s -> 10081.38s]  This is called Compact Python and the Holy Sippy.
[10131.08s -> 10135.67s]  And it's... You gotta do... You're gonna... You're gonna hoo on me here? Hold on.
[10140.28s -> 10149.88s]  Anger in the face. Look at that. I look fucking so mean and fucked up. That was a JoJo reference.
[10151.42s -> 10156.87s]  No, it's not. That's... This is not... That's... Is that Eric Andre?
[10157.59s -> 10168.79s]  How's that a JoJo reference? That's because of the arrow. Oh, well, that was... That was very...
[10168.79s -> 10176.12s]  That was very good. Classic scene from a classic movie, if you haven't seen it. This is... Jerma
[10176.12s -> 10182.98s]  slaps himself a lot. So you can... You can imagine what this one might look like. Oh, you want to
[10182.98s -> 10190.01s]  fight? You want to fucking fight? Don't fucking come at me. Don't... It actually sounds pretty
[10190.01s -> 10232.07s]  good. Oh, you want to fight? You want to fucking fight? Don't fucking come at me. Don't... That's
[10232.07s -> 10256.17s]  a pretty good ending. What was that last clip from? It's from the carnival. Jerma streams watching
[10256.17s -> 10263.67s]  videos just like I'm doing right now. That was pretty fucking crazy. That's... You know what?
[10263.67s -> 10266.47s]  That takes a lot of time because he's something... Maybe it's somebody you've hit at editing,
[10266.47s -> 10274.70s]  aficionados. Don't know. Every single one of these slaps had to be placed on a timeline
[10274.70s -> 10278.62s]  at the right second. You want to fight? You want to fucking fight? Don't fucking come at me. Don't...
[10279.58s -> 10293.11s]  That's like four hours of work right there. Right there. This is literally... It takes hours
[10293.11s -> 10302.44s]  to do this. There's a musical timeline. You've still got to place it though. What is FL Studio,
[10302.44s -> 10315.80s]  by the way? I don't know. Local streamer is a door-to-door salesman starring Homer Simpson on a big
[10315.80s -> 10347.90s]  beanbag chair. Hello? Yes? Hello? Yes? What the fuck? This is called Jerma Trek. Jerma Trek.
[10374.97s -> 10381.93s]  Frontier. These are the voyagers of the Starship Ent... Oh, look! It's the fucking Enterprise!
[10383.70s -> 10390.90s]  Welcome to Star Trek, the next generation! Captain Picard, Jean-Luc... Motherfucking...

[10410.68s -> 10418.97s]  Shut up! Understood. Get in the car.
[10420.87s -> 10446.55s]  Why am I sneaking? Hey, man. Welcome to the stream. My name's Jerma. Nice to meet you. Right
[10446.55s -> 10450.63s]  there. Bingo! Right there. That's the follow button. If you click that, every so often you're
[10450.63s -> 10455.91s]  getting notified that I'm streaming. And I do lots of fun things on this stream, like...
[10457.03s -> 10463.03s]  We are the board. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add to a biological and
[10463.03s -> 10470.30s]  technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to serve us. Resistance is...
[10470.30s -> 10477.13s]  Hey, boys and girls, looks like we got a pass. Hey, look at me! Look at me! That's what you do.
[10479.46s -> 10504.17s]  Ah! Yeah, that's right! This is fucking ridiculous. Uh-oh!
[10506.17s -> 10523.77s]  Oh, shit! Zombies! This is fucking ridiculous. He actually shoots them.
[10525.75s -> 10543.05s]  Fuck you! Why do I have to do that everywhere? What? Why is this so... Why is it so low?
[10548.90s -> 10550.90s]  Yeah! What happened to the audio?
[10553.64s -> 10563.37s]  Oh my god. Uh... The best part about this whole video was the... This part here is my favorite
[10563.37s -> 10567.93s]  part. The... The... What a... The look at... There's... Welcome to the stream.
[10568.89s -> 10574.78s]  You're getting notified that I'm streaming. And I do lots of fun things on this stream, like...
[10575.90s -> 10581.62s]  We are the board. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add to a... Badass!
[10583.06s -> 10589.24s]  Hey, look at me! Look at me! That's what you do. Ah! Yeah!
[10589.24s -> 10594.76s]  Am I gonna scare him? Oh, I can't wait to get in front of the fucking camera and do this again.
[10595.82s -> 10601.98s]  You guys put these clips in such great places. You get in like six or seven more hours of stuff
[10601.98s -> 10610.63s]  to use. I can't wait. In another two or three weeks, I'm doing it again. That was so... That was
[10610.63s -> 10619.14s]  awesome. That was Germa Trek. Uh, this is Dick Richard versus Fat Germa, a test of strength.
[10637.19s -> 10640.07s]  Wait, this is like a real... You guys did this in real life?
[10640.07s -> 10647.67s]  I thought that was a TV show. That's the whole real costume.
[10660.66s -> 10663.82s]  It's a better costume than what was actually in the video.
[10664.70s -> 10680.06s]  No, you don't reveal! You don't reveal the face! You don't reveal the face!
[10684.50s -> 10690.36s]  Now everybody knows who's under there. Uh, I gotta tell you that this costume is better
[10690.36s -> 10699.72s]  than the costume that was in the actual wrestling event. Like, holy shit. That's
[10699.72s -> 10709.19s]  one-to-one. Correct. Excellent job. Is this canon? This is a dream of somebody. Somebody... This is
[10709.19s -> 10718.68s]  somebody had a dream of the wrestling event. And then it was down here. Is it canon? It's
[10718.68s -> 10727.10s]  canon in a dream. Like, it's a dream canon. That was called Dick Richard versus Fat Germa,
[10727.10s -> 10735.77s]  a test of strength. Uh, Germa plays as the best video game character in, uh, video game character
[10735.77s -> 10741.21s]  in gaming history. Oh, I'll show you where I'm gonna play. I'm gonna play Team Fortress 2 as the
[10741.21s -> 10746.09s]  pyromaniac. I'm gonna be playing Team Fortress 2 as Hackman.
[10756.62s -> 10762.89s]  Okay, that was fucking pretty good. That was really good. Oh, I'll show you where I'm gonna play. I'm
[10762.89s -> 10770.09s]  gonna play Team Fortress 2 as the pyromaniac. I'm gonna be playing Team Fortress 2 as Hackman.
[10777.64s -> 10781.56s]  That, like, I mean, I can go pretty high, but I don't think I can go that high.
[10786.74s -> 10789.96s]  That was pretty good. I'm gonna play. I'm gonna play.
[10794.92s -> 10806.14s]  That was close. I love the really, really quick ones that just get right to the point. It's just
[10806.14s -> 10812.62s]  right here. It's just like 10 seconds. It's just, I had, I made this and just show it. It's fucking,
[10812.62s -> 10819.14s]  I love it. Uh, Germa fights Crash PlayStation for the fate of nothing in particular in cinematic
[10819.14s -> 10827.90s]  widescreen. Well, actually, this is like, this is actually probably nine. This is probably like
[10827.90s -> 10848.78s]  14 by 7. I'm back. It's time for you to pay. Yeah, do I actually find him? He's not looking at me.
[10849.58s -> 10852.17s]  I've never seen a bandicoot before.
[10872.90s -> 10883.99s]  Not the boulder. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't want to. Dude, dude, that's just a
[10883.99s -> 10886.87s]  taste of the balling that I'm about to do over here. All right.
[10890.04s -> 10894.84s]  Not bad dodging.
[10909.46s -> 10910.58s]  How's it going grandpa?
[10920.57s -> 10921.05s]  All right.
[10921.53s -> 10928.49s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rewind. Tevo. Tevo. I want to see this again.
[10932.25s -> 10937.19s]  You're going down. Boom. All right. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[10941.35s -> 10947.11s]  Spoilers for Infinity War. If you haven't seen it yet, you have. You've fucking seen Infinity War.
[10947.91s -> 10971.16s]  It changed. Spoiler. What? Why are you making me go? How many times did I do this?
[10987.91s -> 11007.69s]  I don't. Diablo 4 cinematic trip. You're going down. That's my favorite part. How's it going grandpa?
[11013.35s -> 11018.90s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. You're going down. You're going down.
[11020.57s -> 11036.17s]  That was awesome. Clip that face. Dude, uh, this is, I got a warning for you on this one.
[11036.97s -> 11042.44s]  This one might be scary. I just, I've seen the thumbnails on all these pretty much.
[11043.24s -> 11048.18s]  I've seen the first images and this could, this couldn't bite scare small children. So
[11048.90s -> 11054.46s]  get them out of the room. Okay.
[11060.46s -> 11063.34s]  Hey.
[11080.92s -> 11084.76s]  There's more.
[11084.76s -> 11089.56s]  Um, I didn't even go on a diet. It's not a bad idea. Why is it more?
[11112.17s -> 11113.13s]  I actually like this a lot.
[11113.13s -> 11129.35s]  Just this part right here. The very first part.
[11131.91s -> 11136.47s]  That ABC EDFG. I don't even know how to fucking do the alphabet.
[11137.74s -> 11140.22s]  Put the links in the chat, put the links in the chat, put the link in the chat,
[11140.22s -> 11143.98s]  put the link in the chat, put the link in the chat. Hold on. I need to put the link in the chat,
[11143.98s -> 11149.78s]  put the link in the chat. Oh, we're not, we're not even 20% of the way through these videos.
[11149.78s -> 11163.42s]  Put the link in the chat. I don't want you to see them. That's why I'm hiding them right now.
[11163.42s -> 11170.20s]  There is the link for that video. I don't want there to be any spoilers.
[11173.16s -> 11184.47s]  Let's do the next one. This is called 1 a.m. news animatic. I think I, yeah, I know what this is.
[11184.47s -> 11190.07s]  This is, hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 1 a.m. news where we're reporting on a
[11190.07s -> 11195.19s]  local streamer who has gone insane and left his home. Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[11197.43s -> 11210.52s]  Fucking naked. Fucking naked. Am I actually naked? Oh fuck.
[11210.52s -> 11220.63s]  Remember who has gone insane and left his home. Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[11220.63s -> 11229.90s]  Naked. It's not, I'm not naked. That's an image of my chest. It's one frame of nudity.
[11229.90s -> 11237.45s]  No, I had like underwear on. I had shorts on. It says,
[11237.45s -> 11239.21s]  Jerma goes for an evening stroll in the woods.
[11292.22s -> 11296.04s]  You getting anything, Jeff? I'm not seeing anything on the thermal.
[11296.76s -> 11308.15s]  Hello? Is that me? Is that actually his iPhone?
[11310.87s -> 11313.99s]  Dad, you hear that? Gone. Something took off running.
[11313.99s -> 11317.11s]  Let's move that way. Stay tight, guys.
[11317.11s -> 11320.54s]  Look at this trapper. What the hell broke that off?
[11320.54s -> 11323.42s]  Something bit just hanging on a splinter back there, so be careful.
[11323.42s -> 11324.46s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[11325.18s -> 11327.42s]  Holy crap. What the fuck was that?
[11329.58s -> 11330.54s]  That's right there. Right there.
[11330.54s -> 11333.74s]  She's trying to go to the house. Let's get this son of a bitch right now.
[11333.74s -> 11336.46s]  Come on, close in on him. Really, dude? Really?
[11336.46s -> 11340.46s]  Find out how to go, Jeff. I'm looking right in there. I can't see shit.
[11343.10s -> 11346.70s]  Talk to me. It's right there. It went over the hill.
[11346.70s -> 11348.46s]  You see that buck? Listen.
[11349.42s -> 11357.96s]  Holy crap. How about you, son of a bitch, how?
[11358.68s -> 11363.86s]  Don't howl. He's pissed.
[11364.50s -> 11366.66s]  Yes, he's pissed. We just heard something howl
[11366.66s -> 11369.38s]  here in the woods, and it was huge. It was intimidating.
[11369.38s -> 11371.46s]  It was huge. It was super, super loud.
[11376.42s -> 11378.18s]  I'm just trying to go to the bathroom.
[11379.94s -> 11381.46s]  Holy crap. What the fuck was that?
[11381.46s -> 11385.06s]  Nothing to do with this. It's right there.
[11385.06s -> 11386.34s]  Right there. She's trying to go to the house.
[11386.98s -> 11389.70s]  Let's get this son of a bitch right now. Come on, close in on him.
[11389.70s -> 11392.26s]  Really, dude? Really? Find out how to go, Jeff.
[11393.38s -> 11395.22s]  I'm looking right in there. I can't see shit.
[11397.86s -> 11401.46s]  Talk to me. It's right there. It went over the hill.
[11401.46s -> 11403.22s]  You see that buck? Listen.
[11404.18s -> 11412.76s]  Holy crap. How about you, son of a bitch, how?
[11417.86s -> 11418.66s]  He's pissed.
[11420.47s -> 11426.39s]  Uh, this TV show, they just go in the woods and pretend to be chasing Bigfoot?
[11428.63s -> 11431.03s]  I'm more interested in this television show.
[11431.03s -> 11436.02s]  Yes, he's pissed.
[11436.74s -> 11438.34s]  We just heard something howl here in the woods.
[11440.97s -> 11445.58s]  Not just Bigfoot. How many other monsters are there out in the woods?
[11446.38s -> 11451.16s]  There's animals in the woods. There are bears. There are deer.
[11451.80s -> 11456.65s]  There's like wolves, bugs and shit, like frogs.
[11458.78s -> 11460.38s]  What monsters are in the woods?
[11461.10s -> 11470.52s]  The mothman. It's the devil.
[11472.73s -> 11475.53s]  It's a yeti. It's a vulnerable snowman.
[11476.25s -> 11487.37s]  They have like 11 seasons of getting just misinterpretations of bears making noise.
[11489.46s -> 11499.02s]  Really? All effectively that's happening right here is just a bunch of guys
[11499.02s -> 11503.35s]  are stumbling through the woods like irritating and scaring animals.
[11503.35s -> 11508.39s]  What do you got, Jeff?
[11508.39s -> 11509.03s]  You got anything?
[11509.03s -> 11509.51s]  Flashlight.
[11509.51s -> 11510.31s]  Walking right up here.
[11511.27s -> 11512.76s]  It's not real far away.
[11513.40s -> 11515.59s]  It's not.
[11515.59s -> 11516.71s]  And they got like guns?
[11518.23s -> 11522.55s]  I've never seen a movie. Don't you know that like you're going after like Bigfoot with
[11522.55s -> 11525.43s]  what is this a fucking like a shotgun? It's not going to work.
[11526.07s -> 11528.28s]  The guns aren't even real.
[11531.50s -> 11533.98s]  Bigfoot is you're not going to kill him with a shotgun.
[11535.16s -> 11539.72s]  You might be able to kill Bigfoot with like a large rock that you hold over.
[11539.72s -> 11542.92s]  Like it has to be as big as like it's like a boulder and you drop it on him.
[11543.86s -> 11545.78s]  You're going to shoot him with like a pellet gun.
[11545.78s -> 11550.04s]  These guys, they can't even see anything.
[11550.04s -> 11551.32s]  What are you going to shoot at? You're going to miss.
[11552.12s -> 11553.86s]  Real far away.
[11554.74s -> 11555.61s]  He's up there.
[11555.61s -> 11556.17s]  I don't see any.
[11558.49s -> 11564.55s]  They have these minor helmets on that can only see maybe like three or four feet in
[11564.55s -> 11572.87s]  front of them. If Bigfoot is running at you from 200 feet away, you need floodlights and traps and
[11574.23s -> 11575.83s]  they're not helmets. They're just bands.
[11576.47s -> 11582.60s]  This is an in- I want to watch this show. What is this show actually called?
[11584.38s -> 11584.88s]  Yeah.
[11585.66s -> 11587.02s]  Rustling leaves in the woods.
[11589.19s -> 11590.15s]  Not real far away.
[11590.95s -> 11593.67s]  It's called Mountain Monsters.
[11598.54s -> 11599.58s]  Mountain Monsters.
[11603.80s -> 11605.16s]  Have they ever found a guy camping?
[11607.08s -> 11608.44s]  Heard that noise over there.
[11608.44s -> 11609.64s]  There's somebody over there.
[11609.64s -> 11613.64s]  Yeah. And there's a guy just with like a fucking Campbell suit and he's just like,
[11613.64s -> 11615.40s]  hello, you guys all right?
[11615.40s -> 11623.82s]  That's called live footage from the Vegas region.
[11623.82s -> 11625.18s]  Pokemon Shpee.
[11625.18s -> 11639.90s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't understand his preference.
[11639.90s -> 11643.35s]  No, no, you do it.
[11644.87s -> 11645.51s]  You do it.
[11646.15s -> 11648.92s]  I'm sleeping.
[11655.14s -> 11655.64s]  Yeah.
[11656.34s -> 11657.14s]  What am I here?
[11657.86s -> 11659.58s]  Okay, mom.
[11679.26s -> 11680.46s]  Five more minutes, mom.
[11686.23s -> 11686.73s]  Jesus.
[11689.46s -> 11694.18s]  So what- wait, Pokemon did a 24-hour stream where it showed Pokemon sleeping?
[11699.37s -> 11700.17s]  Why did they do that?
[11704.74s -> 11706.66s]  It was live from a region in the game.
[11708.22s -> 11709.66s]  It was worse than that.
[11709.66s -> 11713.96s]  So wait, it just showed like a picture on screen?
[11713.96s -> 11716.44s]  It showed nothing and rustling bushes and a horse.
[11717.24s -> 11724.25s]  So you tell me that Mountain Monsters has more content in it than the Pokemon live stream.
[11729.45s -> 11730.73s]  Interesting stuff.
[11730.73s -> 11734.62s]  This is called Lego Intruder Germa in the Bathroom Tiles.
[11735.74s -> 11737.42s]  We're gonna go to Lego. This is good.
[11737.42s -> 11738.22s]  Let's give it a go.
[11738.22s -> 11742.50s]  What the fuck are these?
[11743.14s -> 11745.94s]  Would you like some stationery?
[11748.14s -> 11749.42s]  We don't want to use- don't use those.
[11751.37s -> 11753.21s]  What are these? These are like notebooks.
[11753.93s -> 11754.89s]  Those explode.
[11754.89s -> 11755.93s]  Yeah, these explode.
[11756.65s -> 11757.53s]  Yeah, they detonate.
[11757.53s -> 11761.05s]  Yeah, if you throw one, you know, let's say at your feet and then you detonate it,
[11762.01s -> 11763.69s]  Are you sure these aren't bathroom tiles?
[11764.97s -> 11765.61s]  Holy shit.
[11767.29s -> 11769.21s]  This is like custom-made.
[11771.30s -> 11772.42s]  What the fuck is going on?
[11772.42s -> 11773.30s]  I don't even know.
[11773.30s -> 11774.66s]  Is there a game?
[11774.66s -> 11775.86s]  Is there a game here?
[11776.82s -> 11777.46s]  I don't know.
[11778.42s -> 11782.36s]  When do we start the game?
[11784.58s -> 11785.08s]  Pizza!
[11786.10s -> 11786.60s]  Oh!
[11789.94s -> 11790.44s]  Whoa.
[11791.06s -> 11792.10s]  Holy shit.
[11792.10s -> 11793.78s]  That guy got destroyed.
[11793.78s -> 11794.28s]  Pizza!
[11795.96s -> 11797.16s]  This is really well done.
[11797.16s -> 11799.00s]  This is really well fucking made.
[11802.68s -> 11804.36s]  Are you sure these aren't bathroom tiles?
[11809.03s -> 11811.03s]  2006 stop motion animation.
[11811.03s -> 11812.31s]  This is way better than that.
[11812.31s -> 11813.11s]  What the fuck is going on?
[11813.11s -> 11813.91s]  I don't even know.
[11813.91s -> 11815.35s]  Is there a game?
[11815.35s -> 11816.55s]  Is there a game here?
[11817.51s -> 11818.15s]  I don't know.
[11821.50s -> 11823.02s]  When do we start the game?
[11825.24s -> 11825.74s]  Pizza!
[11827.00s -> 11827.96s]  So loud, I'm sorry.
[11828.92s -> 11830.50s]  That's for the intruder stream.
[11832.22s -> 11832.70s]  Memories.
[11839.02s -> 11840.06s]  Not louder.
[11840.06s -> 11840.56s]  Softer.
[11841.64s -> 11842.14s]  Softer.
[11843.67s -> 11845.59s]  This one's called Uh-oh, Germa.
[11845.59s -> 11846.15s]  Should I be a...
[11847.11s -> 11848.07s]  Oh no, I know what this is.
[11848.79s -> 11849.29s]  Do I?
[11855.32s -> 11886.95s]  I thought the uh-oh thing was somebody pooping or something.
[11890.98s -> 11892.34s]  Stop the video now.
[11893.30s -> 11893.80s]  What?
[11898.12s -> 11899.32s]  That was Uh-oh, Germa.
[11899.32s -> 11899.72s]  That was...
[11900.28s -> 11902.76s]  I kind of need to blink a few times after seeing that one.
[11902.76s -> 11908.42s]  This one's called Where's Germa?
[11908.42s -> 11908.92s]  Where is he?
[11926.79s -> 11928.79s]  Where's France?
[11939.88s -> 11940.38s]  I'm here.
[11968.97s -> 11970.01s]  That one was interesting.
[11970.73s -> 11972.62s]  That was an interesting one.
[11974.30s -> 11975.10s]  What was that?
[11976.06s -> 11979.74s]  There was people looking where countries were in Europe.
[11980.70s -> 11985.42s]  And then I showed up and screamed and then the video was ending.
[11988.15s -> 11990.07s]  I don't know what happened in this video.
[11991.40s -> 11992.76s]  There was an EU meme.
[11992.76s -> 11994.28s]  Oh, it's North America.
[11995.54s -> 11996.04s]  I don't know.
[11997.83s -> 12001.67s]  This is Michael's Rat's Redneck Birthday Party Remix.
[12001.67s -> 12006.63s]  World's first rodent superstar year.
[12006.63s -> 12022.95s]  Uh, Shazzo.
[12024.15s -> 12024.79s]  Shazzoip.
[12025.59s -> 12027.75s]  Shazzoip just gave 20 community subs.
[12032.94s -> 12036.46s]  This works pretty well.
[12044.54s -> 12047.19s]  Michael Jackson.
[12052.12s -> 12071.30s]  What's up with the music?
[12079.45s -> 12080.65s]  That was fucking funny.
[12081.85s -> 12082.97s]  That was good.
[12082.97s -> 12083.85s]  That was good.
[12083.85s -> 12084.81s]  That was really good.
[12084.81s -> 12085.29s]  I liked...
[12085.29s -> 12086.49s]  I really like that one a lot.
[12086.49s -> 12086.99s]  I do.
[12087.53s -> 12088.33s]  That was great.
[12089.29s -> 12095.14s]  Oh, it was such a good boy this year.
[12100.30s -> 12101.82s]  This is called Tropical Trouble.
[12102.46s -> 12103.42s]  Tropical Trouble.
[12103.42s -> 12104.22s]  I wonder what that means.
[12114.18s -> 12115.38s]  Bumble Buck Productions.
[12116.89s -> 12119.21s]  Called Fast German Triple Alien.
[12119.21s -> 12120.09s]  It's this again.
[12121.88s -> 12123.00s]  In Tropical Trouble.
[12147.37s -> 12149.69s]  Why do we both have steering wheels?
[12149.69s -> 12150.97s]  Wouldn't that be counterproductive?
[12152.97s -> 12160.47s]  A co-pilot?
[12161.48s -> 12163.32s]  But not when you're both turning at the same time.
[12163.64s -> 12164.14s]  Yup.
[12174.22s -> 12176.78s]  Now they must work together to survive on the island.
[12178.94s -> 12181.02s]  It is Purple Alien's job to look for food.
[12182.30s -> 12185.10s]  While Fast German will build a shelter.
[12186.06s -> 12199.72s]  Fuck am I...
[12206.58s -> 12207.88s]  It's a coconut.
[12207.88s -> 12208.68s]  What the fuck is that?
[12208.68s -> 12209.64s]  It's a coconut.
[12211.00s -> 12212.84s]  How do I not know what a coconut is?
[12216.86s -> 12218.14s]  A full turkey dinner.
[12218.14s -> 12218.78s]  I don't want that.
[12219.50s -> 12224.63s]  Oh, it's an alien.
[12224.63s -> 12225.51s]  You're right.
[12225.51s -> 12257.24s]  I love the purpose.
[12272.97s -> 12275.13s]  Now it's getting dark and they have no food or shelter.
[12276.17s -> 12290.14s]  That's it.
[12290.14s -> 12291.18s]  So they decide to leave.
[12299.00s -> 12305.67s]  How did we get in the helicopter again?
[12308.22s -> 12309.74s]  The helicopter just sucked him up.
[12310.98s -> 12315.54s]  That was Fast German and Purple Alien in Tropical Trouble.
[12320.70s -> 12322.46s]  This is called Germacraft The Breakdown.
[12325.98s -> 12327.98s]  Already got a great caricature in this chair.
[12351.32s -> 12352.12s]  What's going on?
[12362.31s -> 12363.27s]  Why am I crying?
[12363.67s -> 12368.39s]  You can tell this is real because listen to my voice.
[12368.95s -> 12369.83s]  It's like stuffed up.
[12374.87s -> 12375.83s]  Was it just shit face?
[12377.50s -> 12378.78s]  You were Omega drunk.
[12384.15s -> 12386.63s]  That is actual Omega drunk.
[12386.63s -> 12387.19s]  Listen to this.
[12387.83s -> 12390.14s]  We actually get to see it on stream.
[12390.14s -> 12391.50s]  We actually get to see it on stream.
[12394.22s -> 12397.10s]  It's like you pitch shifted me 10 to 20% lower.
[12399.40s -> 12400.76s]  Fucking Minecraft is so...
[12401.32s -> 12402.76s]  It's a revolutionary game.
[12407.80s -> 12409.72s]  Is this when I stood up and did the speech
[12409.72s -> 12414.36s]  about how I was moving to Vegas and talking about the community and everything
[12414.36s -> 12416.12s]  and I was even blown out by the music?
[12416.12s -> 12421.22s]  That's the one.
[12422.34s -> 12423.70s]  Okay, I do remember this stream.
[12428.70s -> 12430.78s]  This is called Kooky Germa Joke.
[12446.63s -> 12447.13s]  Did it work?
[12461.51s -> 12462.71s]  That's wicked fucked up.
[12467.88s -> 12469.08s]  That's so fucked up.
[12473.48s -> 12475.16s]  What TV show is this from?
[12476.47s -> 12478.23s]  What TV show is this?
[12483.48s -> 12484.60s]  Is this Scooby Doo?
[12485.74s -> 12486.62s]  Oh my god.
[12487.18s -> 12498.01s]  How would you even find this to match this up?
[12500.34s -> 12501.14s]  Holy fuck.
[12505.05s -> 12506.09s]  Oh my god.
[12506.73s -> 12507.85s]  That's the worst.
[12507.85s -> 12509.45s]  That's the best noise I've ever made.
[12509.45s -> 12511.21s]  Did that win best noise last year?
[12511.21s -> 12511.85s]  It better have.
[12518.31s -> 12519.59s]  No, unbelievable.
[12519.59s -> 12522.07s]  This is called Germa Fortnight Black Hole Meme.
[12535.70s -> 12536.20s]  No!
[12542.25s -> 12542.89s]  Am I supposed to be...
[12542.89s -> 12543.93s]  Who jumped in?
[12543.93s -> 12545.13s]  Oh my god!
[12547.13s -> 12548.17s]  It's a mermaid!
[12548.17s -> 12548.49s]  Please!
[12548.49s -> 12550.49s]  It's supposed to be a YouTube reaction.
[12553.06s -> 12553.70s]  I can't see.
[12553.70s -> 12554.18s]  I can't see.
[12559.67s -> 12560.63s]  This is awesome.
[12564.28s -> 12569.74s]  No, no, no.
[12575.02s -> 12576.38s]  I'm fucking crying.
[12576.38s -> 12577.42s]  God damn it.
[12578.38s -> 12580.46s]  You're killing me.
[12580.46s -> 12584.94s]  ...serial, non-branded, Captain Crunch character that is Fortnite.
[12588.14s -> 12590.76s]  Get the off-brand Fortnite.
[12590.76s -> 12591.64s]  This is not Fortnite.
[12591.64s -> 12592.28s]  Don't sue me.
[12597.27s -> 12599.11s]  Can they get it?
[12599.67s -> 12601.22s]  What is going on?
[12602.89s -> 12604.41s]  What is going on?
[12605.45s -> 12615.08s]  Fortnite is going on.
[12615.08s -> 12616.28s]  Love for Germa is not.
[12618.62s -> 12619.66s]  Wait, hold on a minute.
[12620.78s -> 12623.03s]  What you guys need to understand is
[12623.99s -> 12624.87s]  the face came here.
[12624.87s -> 12625.27s]  This is...
[12625.99s -> 12627.22s]  What is this from?
[12628.25s -> 12629.05s]  This is...
[12629.05s -> 12630.65s]  What stream is this from?
[12630.65s -> 12635.80s]  It's from The Thing.
[12636.60s -> 12638.22s]  That's from Darkwood.
[12639.29s -> 12643.61s]  This is reacting to scary fucking monsters trying to kill me on screen.
[12644.68s -> 12647.48s]  Why does this work as a YouTuber reacting to Fortnite?
[12663.11s -> 12663.61s]  No!
[12673.26s -> 12675.64s]  It's a mermaid!
[12675.64s -> 12676.14s]  Please!
[12677.88s -> 12681.14s]  I can't see.
[12681.14s -> 12681.64s]  I can't see.
[12682.34s -> 12697.02s]  Oh no.
[12703.16s -> 12707.00s]  Like, super overreaction to everything.
[12719.69s -> 12720.19s]  No!
[12726.90s -> 12727.86s]  He jumped in!
[12727.86s -> 12729.14s]  Oh my god!
[12731.06s -> 12732.18s]  It's a mermaid!
[12732.18s -> 12732.68s]  Please!
[12741.70s -> 12743.06s]  He jumped in.
[12749.75s -> 12751.59s]  That is phenomenal.
[12751.59s -> 12752.47s]  It's so funny.
[12755.90s -> 12759.48s]  I can't see!
[12759.48s -> 12759.98s]  I can't see!
[12760.68s -> 12762.12s]  This is from Darkwood.
[12762.12s -> 12764.36s]  Like, I'm playing a terrifying fucking game.
[12769.19s -> 12772.79s]  Why is everybody, like, dancing?
[12774.79s -> 12775.59s]  You're killing me!
[12776.15s -> 12777.67s]  You're killing me!
[12777.67s -> 12779.11s]  You're killing me, Epic!
[12779.11s -> 12780.23s]  I need to know what it is!
[12781.91s -> 12782.95s]  What am I saying here?
[12786.73s -> 12787.45s]  You're killing me!
[12797.11s -> 12797.35s]  No...
[12797.35s -> 12798.15s]  Oh, non-Brit...
[12798.15s -> 12799.11s]  Right, from The Carnival.
[12810.47s -> 12811.59s]  You're killing me.
[12812.15s -> 12812.65s]  Okay.
[12814.15s -> 12815.02s]  Okay.
[12815.72s -> 12816.44s]  Let's keep going.
[12816.44s -> 12817.24s]  We gotta keep going.
[12818.14s -> 12819.66s]  We can't get stuck on one video.
[12822.82s -> 12823.78s]  Oh my god.
[12825.05s -> 12826.41s]  There's so much going on in this.
[12829.46s -> 12830.10s]  That was great.
[12831.99s -> 12832.71s]  This one's called
[12832.71s -> 12835.51s]  Jerma vs Jevil Quest for the Gamer License.
[12836.07s -> 12839.58s]  I'm going off-cam for this one.
[12840.22s -> 12841.90s]  Because, like, boogers are coming out of my fucking nose,
[12841.90s -> 12843.42s]  so I have to, like, wipe my nose.
[12861.75s -> 12863.64s]  Asshole.
[12876.82s -> 12877.32s]  Oh no!
[12878.58s -> 12879.08s]  Oh my god!
[12882.65s -> 12883.15s]  Oh!
[12885.69s -> 12886.19s]  Nice!
[12887.21s -> 12890.14s]  Not bad for someone who died of Pinwheel.
[12890.95s -> 12892.39s]  I beat Pin...
[12892.39s -> 12893.03s]  Whatever.
[12893.03s -> 12894.55s]  People are starting to believe them.
[12894.55s -> 12895.05s]  You know?
[12895.67s -> 12897.51s]  I've gone to, like, Reddit threads before.
[12897.51s -> 12897.91s]  I've talked to...
[12897.91s -> 12898.63s]  Have I talked about this?
[12898.63s -> 12899.67s]  I probably have, but I need to make it...
[12899.67s -> 12900.71s]  I've reiterated again.
[12901.35s -> 12901.83s]  Like, someone...
[12901.83s -> 12903.27s]  There'll be, like, a Reddit poster.
[12903.27s -> 12903.67s]  I'm just like,
[12903.67s -> 12904.63s]  What the fuck?
[12905.67s -> 12907.51s]  I can't even, like, defend myself.
[12907.51s -> 12908.87s]  How am I supposed to, like, defend...
[12911.67s -> 12912.17s]  Who?
[12912.73s -> 12913.53s]  Up in the smoke.
[12947.58s -> 12949.42s]  Why is Stream laughs?
[12949.98s -> 12953.40s]  Well, if two in the hand is worth one in the bush,
[12954.20s -> 12956.99s]  looks like this guy went shush.
[12962.76s -> 12965.56s]  I thought the bits were a part of the video.
[12967.48s -> 12969.16s]  Ever heard of the stage tick tock?
[12969.16s -> 12969.66s]  No!
[12973.07s -> 12975.55s]  Uh, PhylacteryLich just gave 10,000 bits.
[12979.00s -> 12980.60s]  Thanks for the 100 fucking dollars.
[12982.48s -> 12982.98s]  Again.
[12983.62s -> 12984.18s]  And you say,
[12984.18s -> 12986.50s]  Jerma, you absolutely have to do another green screen stream.
[12986.50s -> 12988.82s]  This community makes amazing fan videos.
[12988.82s -> 12990.42s]  Well, that's the plan in, like, two weeks.
[12991.39s -> 12992.51s]  In a few days,
[12992.51s -> 12995.79s]  there's gonna be another Discord channel to talk about things for me to do,
[12995.79s -> 13000.83s]  and we're gonna do another 100, 200 actions in front of the green screen again.
[13003.52s -> 13005.44s]  Green screen DLC for free.
[13005.44s -> 13008.29s]  That's the title of the stream.
[13008.29s -> 13009.23s]  Pretty good title.
[13009.87s -> 13012.59s]  I do not want to know about TikTok clock,
[13012.59s -> 13015.50s]  but I do want to know about up in smoke,
[13015.50s -> 13017.74s]  but Jerma forgets how to use fire magic.
[13018.30s -> 13023.14s]  But thank you PhylacteryLich for the 100 bucks.
[13023.14s -> 13023.64s]  Seriously.
[13025.46s -> 13027.35s]  I'm back.
[13028.05s -> 13028.55s]  I'm back.
[13031.87s -> 13034.99s]  Up in smoke, but Jerma forgets how to use fire magic.
[13034.99s -> 13037.55s]  So I think the thing,
[13038.11s -> 13040.74s]  so I think the thing about,
[13042.02s -> 13044.10s]  um, I think eating, going on a diet,
[13044.10s -> 13044.90s]  it's not a bad idea.
[13044.90s -> 13047.41s]  It's, oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[13047.97s -> 13050.53s]  There is, wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[13051.25s -> 13053.38s]  Okay, he landed.
[13055.81s -> 13056.85s]  Ooh, up in smoke!
[13057.57s -> 13059.70s]  No, there, there, I heard it.
[13059.70s -> 13060.50s]  I just heard it, I did.
[13067.18s -> 13103.28s]  Colonel Mustang.
[13103.28s -> 13103.92s]  It didn't work.
[13107.18s -> 13107.98s]  Oh, fuck me.
[13107.98s -> 13108.48s]  Goodbye.
[13112.62s -> 13115.58s]  Oh, a fucking Colonel Mustang for a full metal alchemist.
[13115.58s -> 13118.54s]  You can, I love that I'm going to practice outside the room
[13118.54s -> 13119.74s]  because I don't want you to see it on camera
[13119.74s -> 13120.62s]  because it's embarrassing.
[13135.73s -> 13136.23s]  Keep going.
[13137.66s -> 13139.50s]  This is Jerma walks a thousand miles.
[13142.13s -> 13143.81s]  Everybody watching the VOD right now.
[13146.27s -> 13147.23s]  It's about to be quiet,
[13147.23s -> 13149.95s]  probably because this is looks like it's probably a full song.
[13151.62s -> 13156.14s]  Um, VOD, sorry guys.
[13157.18s -> 13158.30s]  You'll be back really soon.
[13158.94s -> 13163.18s]  You'll be back in exactly four minutes.
[13163.18s -> 13180.67s]  Making my way downtown, walking fast.
[13180.67s -> 13185.63s]  Face this path and I'm homebound.
[13185.63s -> 13199.30s]  Yeah, just making my way, making my way through the crowd.
[13199.30s -> 13206.27s]  And I need you, and I miss you, and now I want.
[13207.94s -> 13217.79s]  If I could fall into the sky, do you think time went past me by?
[13217.79s -> 13228.88s]  Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I see you tonight.
[13228.88s -> 13238.70s]  I'm gonna think of you and wonder if you ever think of me.
[13238.70s -> 13239.82s]  This is the whole song.
[13240.38s -> 13241.58s]  This is really well done.
[13242.86s -> 13247.74s]  Wrong way.
[13248.22s -> 13251.58s]  20 more community subs from Shazzo IP.
[13251.58s -> 13252.70s]  Thank you so much.
[13252.70s -> 13253.66s]  40 on the night.
[13254.38s -> 13263.38s]  Cause I need you, and I miss you, and now I want.
[13263.38s -> 13272.42s]  If I could fall into the sky, do you think time went past me by?
[13272.42s -> 13284.54s]  Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I see you tonight.
[13284.54s -> 13287.31s]  There's more song.
[13287.87s -> 13288.91s]  How long is this song?
[13289.71s -> 13291.58s]  Does this song end here?
[13292.46s -> 13298.69s]  Here come the emotes.
[13299.49s -> 13312.43s]  Rich.
[13312.43s -> 13312.99s]  Oh, right.
[13314.03s -> 13315.55s]  Making my way downtown.
[13315.55s -> 13317.06s]  I'm fast.
[13317.06s -> 13321.06s]  Face this path and I'm homebound.
[13321.06s -> 13322.58s]  I'm gonna get sued by...
[13322.58s -> 13322.82s]  What?
[13322.82s -> 13323.38s]  What's her name?
[13324.34s -> 13325.54s]  Melissa McCarthy?
[13325.54s -> 13326.10s]  What's her name?
[13326.10s -> 13327.70s]  Making my way, making my way through the crowd.
[13327.70s -> 13328.42s]  Who made this song?
[13333.26s -> 13334.22s]  Vanessa Carlin.
[13334.94s -> 13335.42s]  What?
[13335.42s -> 13336.78s]  Melissa McCarthy?
[13336.78s -> 13349.42s]  Cause I still miss you, and now I could fall into the sky.
[13350.59s -> 13355.39s]  Do you think time would pass us by?
[13355.39s -> 13362.59s]  Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I see you tonight.
[13362.59s -> 13368.10s]  So what if I like fuck up the VOD?
[13368.10s -> 13370.82s]  Can I like talk over this and make it so that it doesn't get claimed?
[13370.82s -> 13372.26s]  Do you think time would pass me by?
[13372.26s -> 13373.82s]  Like what if I just start going like...
[13373.82s -> 13400.42s]  Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I see you tonight.
[13400.42s -> 13401.62s]  Half Life 2 Zombie.
[13402.42s -> 13407.38s]  That was gonna work, trust me.
[13410.13s -> 13411.01s]  I can't even do that again.
[13414.58s -> 13417.06s]  Yes, I can.
[13417.06s -> 13418.58s]  I'm fucking so good at it.
[13419.14s -> 13427.63s]  It's the worst sound, best sound.
[13427.63s -> 13428.59s]  Make up your mind!
[13430.70s -> 13435.34s]  I have to sit here for a second cause if the VOD gets muted, it's gonna mute like another minute.
[13436.14s -> 13439.44s]  So we have to wait.
[13439.44s -> 13441.04s]  I'm looking after you, VOD.
[13441.04s -> 13442.24s]  This is for the VOD watchers.
[13443.55s -> 13444.67s]  Can I write this down so I can...
[13444.67s -> 13445.63s]  I need to communicate with them.
[13451.82s -> 13453.50s]  Here, I'll write unmuted soon.
[13454.06s -> 13455.57s]  I need to be able to commit...
[13455.57s -> 13456.05s]  Wait, don't...
[13456.05s -> 13456.53s]  Wait, don't go!
[13456.53s -> 13465.81s]  Don't move, don't go anywhere.
[13465.81s -> 13468.80s]  My hand is so sweaty.
[13468.80s -> 13478.27s]  I can't even write with permanent marker on it.
[13478.27s -> 13478.51s]  Here.
[13480.26s -> 13481.22s]  Unmuted soon.
[13484.93s -> 13485.25s]  Soon.
[13488.82s -> 13490.34s]  People thought I was making that shit up.
[13490.34s -> 13491.78s]  You wanna see something?
[13491.78s -> 13495.70s]  He's lying about how he's like fucking 200 degrees fucking Celsius.
[13495.70s -> 13496.18s]  Oh yeah?
[13496.90s -> 13501.07s]  This is permanent marker.
[13506.86s -> 13507.34s]  I just...
[13507.34s -> 13508.78s]  I melt shit when I touch it.
[13514.54s -> 13514.94s]  You saw...
[13514.94s -> 13515.58s]  It's a Sharpie.
[13515.58s -> 13516.54s]  This shit's...
[13516.54s -> 13517.82s]  This is forever.
[13517.82s -> 13525.36s]  That's such a shitty superpower.
[13525.36s -> 13528.50s]  Hey, do you guys remember the writing that was on my hand?
[13530.82s -> 13531.62s]  Who was here for that?
[13532.74s -> 13533.94s]  30 to 40 seconds ago.
[13533.94s -> 13534.58s]  Who was here for that?
[13534.58s -> 13535.22s]  Were you here for that?
[13535.78s -> 13546.53s]  Who was here for that?
[13546.53s -> 13547.97s]  Why am I on Reddit?
[13551.73s -> 13552.29s]  No, love that.
[13552.29s -> 13556.98s]  This is wrong thing.
[13556.98s -> 13559.22s]  Oh, that's the last thing we looked at on the image side.
[13559.22s -> 13559.46s]  Right.
[13559.46s -> 13559.78s]  Okay.
[13561.30s -> 13561.78s]  Let's go!
[13568.05s -> 13569.73s]  This one's called Sick Bass Drop.
[13570.05s -> 13609.58s]  I feel like if you did that, if somebody really did that, I think people would think it was
[13609.58s -> 13610.38s]  fucking awesome.
[13611.02s -> 13612.14s]  You don't think you would too?
[13612.94s -> 13613.50s]  It'd be so...
[13613.50s -> 13614.94s]  You'd be like, holy shit, this is...
[13615.74s -> 13617.97s]  What is this?
[13618.69s -> 13624.54s]  This is so different and new age.
[13625.84s -> 13626.48s]  They're drunk.
[13628.64s -> 13630.00s]  So that's even better.
[13630.00s -> 13631.22s]  They could like...
[13631.22s -> 13633.54s]  It'll be like, wow, this is the best song I've ever heard!
[13634.34s -> 13636.58s]  And then I'll get $500,000 in royalties.
[13637.22s -> 13640.69s]  This is German versus Obi-Wan and Anakin.
[13645.12s -> 13647.42s]  Hey, what's up, uh...
[13647.42s -> 13648.98s]  Is this Vinny?
[13648.98s -> 13649.54s]  Is this Vinny?
[13649.54s -> 13650.42s]  Is this Vinesauce?
[13651.14s -> 13653.86s]  You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.
[13654.66s -> 13656.02s]  Wait, wait, what?
[13656.98s -> 13658.18s]  This is spoilers?
[13658.50s -> 13659.06s]  Okay, fine.
[13659.06s -> 13664.48s]  Spoilers for Star Wars the prequels that you're gonna skip anyways because you're not gonna
[13664.48s -> 13666.32s]  watch the prequels because people hate them for some reason.
[13666.32s -> 13667.12s]  I like the prequels.
[13667.12s -> 13667.84s]  What's wrong with them?
[13677.31s -> 13683.09s]  There's a lot wrong with the prequels, but come on, Yoda has the lightsaber?
[13683.09s -> 13683.65s]  Pog.
[13694.29s -> 13696.93s]  You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.
[13697.57s -> 13698.53s]  We'll take them together.
[13698.77s -> 13699.89s]  You're going slowly on the left.
[13699.89s -> 13700.53s]  I'm taking it now!
[13700.53s -> 13701.41s]  No, Anakin, no!
[13702.05s -> 13702.29s]  No!
[13702.29s -> 13703.73s]  Get the fuck out of here!
[13703.73s -> 13708.45s]  How dare you come into my dream and humiliate me in front of my 60,000 fucking viewers!
[13708.45s -> 13710.13s]  I'll bring you toilet water.
[13710.13s -> 13712.37s]  I'll bring you toilet water.
[13712.37s -> 13715.42s]  Problems with toilet?
[13715.42s -> 13721.86s]  Think so.
[13741.02s -> 13747.09s]  What's up, man?
[13747.81s -> 13750.70s]  One more time.
[13750.70s -> 13753.94s]  Hey, what's up?
[13753.94s -> 13755.06s]  What's up, uh...
[13755.06s -> 13756.74s]  Is this Vinny?
[13756.82s -> 13757.30s]  Is this Vinny?
[13757.30s -> 13758.18s]  Is this Vinesauce?
[13758.90s -> 13761.62s]  You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.
[13762.66s -> 13763.62s]  That's Mace...
[13763.62s -> 13765.78s]  That's Mace Windu talking!
[13765.78s -> 13766.98s]  Is that Mace Windu?
[13768.62s -> 13769.02s]  Listen.
[13769.02s -> 13769.98s]  I'm taking it now!
[13769.98s -> 13770.46s]  No, Anakin!
[13770.46s -> 13771.42s]  We'll take them together.
[13771.42s -> 13772.56s]  We're going slowly on the left.
[13772.56s -> 13773.20s]  I'm taking it now!
[13773.20s -> 13774.88s]  You killed today, Jeremy.
[13774.88s -> 13776.56s]  Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.
[13778.74s -> 13779.46s]  That's Vinny?
[13780.02s -> 13780.96s]  No, it's not!
[13780.96s -> 13782.88s]  That's the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.
[13784.54s -> 13786.38s]  No, that's Mace Windu!
[13791.33s -> 13792.61s]  That's not...
[13792.61s -> 13793.97s]  Is it actually Vinny?
[13794.69s -> 13795.49s]  Listen closely.
[13795.49s -> 13797.65s]  For all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.
[13802.67s -> 13803.55s]  Is this Vinny?
[13803.55s -> 13804.11s]  Is this Vinny?
[13804.11s -> 13804.91s]  Is this Vinesauce?
[13805.71s -> 13808.91s]  You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.
[13808.91s -> 13809.95s]  We'll take them together.
[13809.95s -> 13811.07s]  You're going slowly on the left.
[13811.07s -> 13811.71s]  I'm taking it now!
[13811.71s -> 13812.35s]  No, Anakin!
[13812.35s -> 13812.59s]  No!
[13813.23s -> 13813.47s]  No!
[13813.47s -> 13814.91s]  Get the fuck out of here!
[13814.91s -> 13816.43s]  How dare you come into my crew!
[13816.43s -> 13819.63s]  You humiliate me in front of my 60,000 fucking viewers!
[13819.63s -> 13820.83s]  I'll bring you toilet water.
[13821.63s -> 13822.91s]  I'll bring you toilet water.
[13822.91s -> 13825.31s]  The backhand is the best thing ever.
[13825.31s -> 13826.11s]  Problem with the toilet?
[13827.63s -> 13833.02s]  Think so.
[13843.12s -> 13847.17s]  That's what you sound like.
[13854.56s -> 13860.19s]  Imagine you had the time to backhand somebody in a lightsaber fight like that.
[13861.47s -> 13862.35s]  Ay, ay, ay.
[13862.35s -> 13863.95s]  That was fucking funny.
[13863.95s -> 13867.55s]  This is called Jerma Awu.
[13872.45s -> 13873.49s]  Why is this called Awu?
[13876.50s -> 13877.94s]  What brings you out this far?
[13891.52s -> 13892.72s]  What is going on?
[13893.68s -> 13894.56s]  What is going on?
[13896.16s -> 13902.00s]  Now, that's a name I've not heard in a long time.
[13902.00s -> 13903.92s]  I thought it was part of the script.
[13903.92s -> 13905.12s]  I think my uncle knows him.
[13905.92s -> 13908.24s]  I'm just playing Star Wars.
[13908.24s -> 13908.88s]  What?
[13908.88s -> 13909.44s]  Not yet.
[13910.56s -> 13911.20s]  You know it.
[13911.20s -> 13912.83s]  Of course I know it.
[13913.39s -> 13914.18s]  It's me.
[13918.11s -> 13920.03s]  I didn't know auto play was going.
[13922.58s -> 13926.26s]  I was trying to figure out what the fuck was going on in this video.
[13935.44s -> 13936.64s]  Turn off auto play?
[13936.64s -> 13937.12s]  I know!
[13945.18s -> 13947.58s]  Well, look, let me give some defense here.
[13947.58s -> 13949.42s]  We just watched like a Star Wars one.
[13949.42s -> 13952.54s]  I don't know if that was maybe the same person that made the video
[13952.54s -> 13953.98s]  or if it was like a group of friends.
[13953.98s -> 13956.70s]  They were like, hey, let's make like Star Wars shit in our videos.
[13956.70s -> 13957.26s]  I don't know.
[13958.30s -> 13964.64s]  That's a weak defense.
[13964.64s -> 13965.68s]  That's Jerma Awu.
[13966.40s -> 13968.80s]  This is also called Jerma Jump Scare.
[13968.96s -> 13969.60s]  What was that?
[13975.15s -> 13977.23s]  This is the same thing.
[14004.34s -> 14005.46s]  Oh my God.
[14006.34s -> 14013.06s]  This is called Jerma Bars.
[14013.94s -> 14014.66s]  Jerma Bars.
[14014.66s -> 14017.46s]  Previously on Jerma Community Night a month or so ago.
[14017.46s -> 14020.42s]  It's like when you get to a certain point when you sing
[14020.98s -> 14025.62s]  and you hit the absolute, I cannot do this, but I'm going to try anyways.
[14025.62s -> 14029.54s]  That's how you get like the like, now I know.
[14029.78s -> 14032.03s]  My A.
[14032.03s -> 14033.63s]  You can't like go any higher.
[14036.27s -> 14036.51s]  No.
[14037.39s -> 14041.54s]  Fucking Souls games.
[14042.88s -> 14044.80s]  When in doubt, radish it out.
[14045.36s -> 14059.90s]  Sounds like a snare.
[14067.47s -> 14069.55s]  One, two, three.
[14087.84s -> 14088.72s]  You know the drill.
[14088.72s -> 14089.68s]  Yep, we do.
[14090.24s -> 14097.68s]  We do.
[14112.34s -> 14134.08s]  Oh my fucking God.
[14168.96s -> 14233.98s]  Oh, that was a fucking awesome link, link, link, link, link.
[14234.54s -> 14235.02s]  Oh yeah.
[14235.82s -> 14236.54s]  I'll give you a link.
[14237.10s -> 14246.02s]  There you are.
[14246.02s -> 14246.74s]  Uh, moving on.
[14247.46s -> 14251.73s]  We've got, we've got, we still have a nice chunk of stuff to see.
[14256.69s -> 14260.61s]  This one is called Fireman First Day in the Park.
[14261.25s -> 14263.84s]  A Jerma985 animation.
[14276.72s -> 14277.68s]  First Day in the Park.
[14278.64s -> 14292.86s]  Animation by Kit Cekat.
[14301.89s -> 14309.41s]  Where are you going, Fireman?
[14310.13s -> 14317.52s]  I feel like this could be on like Sesame Street.
[14317.52s -> 14326.30s]  Never mind.
[14348.38s -> 14349.42s]  No, don't go in the water.
[14350.43s -> 14350.75s]  No.
[14351.63s -> 14369.74s]  He's all right.
[14369.74s -> 14370.94s]  That was cute.
[14370.94s -> 14372.46s]  Fireman's First Day in the Park.
[14373.74s -> 14375.18s]  You can come back out.
[14375.18s -> 14375.58s]  We'll just...
[14386.11s -> 14387.47s]  What is going on?
[14387.47s -> 14397.90s]  Is he all right?
[14398.46s -> 14409.02s]  What the fuck?
[14409.02s -> 14409.58s]  Crash it.
[14412.38s -> 14413.50s]  Why so many cars?
[14415.10s -> 14426.43s]  Holy shit.
[14427.55s -> 14428.43s]  Oh, snake.
[14429.55s -> 14433.14s]  The snake.
[14433.14s -> 14433.70s]  Otherwise.
[14434.50s -> 14437.17s]  There goes otherwise.
[14439.20s -> 14439.84s]  See, he's okay.
[14439.84s -> 14440.24s]  He's fine.
[14443.39s -> 14444.91s]  That was really just cute.
[14446.03s -> 14448.83s]  Except for the part where the whole thing burnt down.
[14448.83s -> 14450.75s]  And then there were 10 car crashes.
[14451.31s -> 14455.46s]  It's not the real Fireman.
[14458.74s -> 14459.86s]  You mean the whole video.
[14462.42s -> 14463.30s]  No, that was awesome.
[14465.71s -> 14469.31s]  This is called Source Filmmaker Bill Crazy, featuring Gary the Fuck Up.
[14469.87s -> 14476.50s]  Hey, what's going on, crazy fires?
[14476.50s -> 14479.54s]  It's me, Crazy Bill Crazy.
[14479.54s -> 14481.78s]  I'm here with another video, hit with always.
[14481.78s -> 14482.90s]  Gary the Fuck Up.
[14482.90s -> 14484.18s]  That's me, Gary the Fuck Up.
[14484.18s -> 14488.26s]  And today, as you see, I'm sitting in a pool of water.
[14488.26s -> 14488.82s]  Water?
[14488.82s -> 14489.94s]  And with water in it.
[14489.94s -> 14491.30s]  That's right, motherfucker.
[14491.30s -> 14495.94s]  And what's going to happen here today, Gary is going to drop a toaster in here.
[14495.94s -> 14496.42s]  That's right.
[14496.42s -> 14498.02s]  I'm going to see how long I can last.
[14498.02s -> 14499.70s]  It's going to hurt like a bitch.
[14499.70s -> 14500.82s]  You know what I mean?
[14500.82s -> 14501.38s]  Can't wait.
[14501.38s -> 14502.82s]  It's going to scare me.
[14502.82s -> 14503.46s]  Yeah.
[14503.46s -> 14504.66s]  Gary, I'm ready.
[14504.66s -> 14505.14s]  You ready?
[14505.14s -> 14505.78s]  Throw it in there.
[14505.78s -> 14506.26s]  You ready?
[14506.26s -> 14507.78s]  Make sure you like this video.
[14507.78s -> 14508.26s]  Get ready.
[14510.26s -> 14511.94s]  Wow, that was...
[14513.55s -> 14514.59s]  That was crazy.
[14519.84s -> 14522.61s]  Hey, what's...
[14540.50s -> 14541.70s]  Gary, I'm ready.
[14541.70s -> 14542.18s]  You ready?
[14542.18s -> 14542.74s]  Throw it in there.
[14542.74s -> 14543.30s]  You ready?
[14543.30s -> 14544.74s]  Make sure you like this video.
[14549.34s -> 14550.30s]  Gary the Fuck Up.
[14551.82s -> 14552.46s]  That was great.
[14555.23s -> 14558.51s]  And then the clown just kind of shows up here.
[14559.15s -> 14559.87s]  Wow, that was...
[14561.47s -> 14562.51s]  That was crazy.
[14563.31s -> 14565.78s]  What's this clown?
[14566.34s -> 14569.06s]  Good animation, good stuff.
[14569.06s -> 14569.86s]  There's a link.
[14569.86s -> 14570.66s]  You got it.
[14570.66s -> 14580.51s]  Let's keep going.
[14580.51s -> 14608.54s]  This next one is called SCP-985.
[14608.54s -> 14609.04s]  That's it.
[14611.95s -> 14613.15s]  The Elmo at the end.
[14621.01s -> 14623.79s]  Short, sweet, and it was really good.
[14625.41s -> 14626.13s]  Way to go.
[14626.13s -> 14630.56s]  Uh, I don't know.
[14630.56s -> 14632.32s]  This is called the third rat song.
[14632.32s -> 14632.82s]  Kinda.
[14633.52s -> 14634.02s]  Kinda.
[14663.63s -> 14680.94s]  There's the real image of my face.
[14682.51s -> 14683.79s]  That was really, really, really good.
[14684.59s -> 14686.62s]  Third rat song, kinda.
[14690.86s -> 14692.62s]  Yeah, that face will be an emote.
[14692.62s -> 14693.74s]  I will make it an emote.
[14693.74s -> 14694.24s]  I promise.
[14694.86s -> 14696.19s]  This is hard to see.
[14697.95s -> 14699.71s]  Why is this community so good at making music?
[14700.51s -> 14703.23s]  The better question is why is this community so good at making everything?
[14703.87s -> 14709.52s]  You want a link for this one too?
[14709.52s -> 14710.40s]  Sure thing.
[14710.40s -> 14721.34s]  Coming up next.
[14724.46s -> 14724.94s]  We have...
[14724.94s -> 14726.54s]  This is called German 985.
[14728.06s -> 14729.82s]  Fandango movie clips.
[14729.82s -> 14732.22s]  Green screen movie scene, one out of one.
[14756.38s -> 14758.70s]  Yes, I knew what it was gonna be.
[14759.26s -> 14759.90s]  I knew it.
[14778.62s -> 14779.98s]  It's so funny.
[14779.98s -> 14783.31s]  Cause like, seriously, sometimes you do like a Fandango movie clip.
[14783.31s -> 14785.63s]  It's like eight seconds long.
[14786.43s -> 14790.77s]  Why does it have to be this much time spent on all the stuff at the end?
[14791.49s -> 14794.85s]  You nailed it.
[14794.85s -> 14796.53s]  You fucking nailed it.
[14797.57s -> 14813.39s]  It's so good.
[14822.50s -> 14823.86s]  Steven Spielberg.
[14824.74s -> 14831.15s]  Okay, question.
[14832.13s -> 14833.73s]  What the hell is Fandango?
[14835.17s -> 14836.61s]  Why do they have all this stuff at the end?
[14837.25s -> 14841.10s]  I don't even know what this is selling me.
[14841.10s -> 14842.14s]  Is it a product?
[14842.78s -> 14844.61s]  Is it movie tickets?
[14848.19s -> 14849.23s]  It's a ticket seller.
[14849.23s -> 14850.43s]  So what's this like...
[14850.43s -> 14851.87s]  What's all this other stuff at the end here?
[14853.25s -> 14856.45s]  Do you go to Fandango and click on like I'm in an excited mood
[14856.45s -> 14858.85s]  and they recommend tickets for shows?
[14864.72s -> 14865.04s]  Yes.
[14867.62s -> 14868.66s]  Why would you ever do that?
[14869.22s -> 14875.84s]  There were like 10 to 15 movies in the theater at any given moment.
[14875.84s -> 14878.56s]  There's like two or three movies per genre for you to see.
[14881.94s -> 14885.90s]  It's not that hard.
[14885.90s -> 14886.86s]  Sometimes, yeah, less than that.
[14886.86s -> 14888.78s]  Like eight in the theater.
[14888.78s -> 14890.86s]  What's with the...
[14890.86s -> 14891.74s]  Ah, I don't know.
[14891.74s -> 14892.86s]  People screaming.
[14892.86s -> 14896.18s]  People were just screaming.
[14896.18s -> 14896.42s]  I don't know.
[14896.42s -> 14897.54s]  People just scream in this chat.
[14898.48s -> 14899.12s]  You guys know that.
[14899.12s -> 14900.16s]  You've been around a long time.
[14901.89s -> 14906.11s]  Why was I saying, ah, yeah, that is you.
[14906.11s -> 14907.31s]  That is actually you.
[14907.31s -> 14907.71s]  You're right.
[14909.92s -> 14910.40s]  Yeah, that's...
[14913.54s -> 14914.66s]  Yeah, that's you.
[14914.66s -> 14915.14s]  That is you.
[14916.53s -> 14918.53s]  All one, two, three, four, five...
[14918.53s -> 14919.25s]  All five of you here.
[14919.25s -> 14923.02s]  What were you doing?
[14923.02s -> 14923.90s]  I wonder.
[14923.90s -> 14929.82s]  That was fantastic though.
[14931.78s -> 14933.06s]  I want to link this one because like...
[14934.85s -> 14937.09s]  This is very, very, very, very creative.
[14943.92s -> 14944.64s]  Bingo.
[14944.64s -> 14946.14s]  All right.
[14946.14s -> 14949.98s]  We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[14949.98s -> 14954.34s]  There are ten more videos to watch.
[14954.34s -> 14962.18s]  This is called Las Vegas Noir.
[14965.98s -> 14980.06s]  Side comment?
[14993.10s -> 14994.38s]  Las Vegas Noir.
[14999.12s -> 15001.63s]  Captain, we were on our way to interview...
[15002.67s -> 15003.55s]  Yes, folks, I know.
[15004.88s -> 15007.28s]  This particular fiend is an old acquaintance.
[15008.24s -> 15011.44s]  I have tried to reaffirm his belief in a wrathful and terrible god.
[15012.48s -> 15016.42s]  Whichever way it goes, he did it in reverse.
[15021.20s -> 15022.40s]  You look like you've had it rough.
[15033.98s -> 15037.90s]  You're maybe five, five, five, six tops.
[15037.90s -> 15039.34s]  And you wear size 11s?
[15039.34s -> 15040.14s]  I don't think so.
[15041.92s -> 15045.28s]  You have no job and nowhere to live by the smell of things.
[15045.84s -> 15046.72s]  And you need money.
[15046.72s -> 15049.44s]  Answer the goddamn question, Rudy, before I brain you.
[15052.19s -> 15053.87s]  You disappoint me, Cole, folks.
[15055.28s -> 15057.36s]  Get back in there and make some lunch, boy.
[15057.36s -> 15058.40s]  I need a confession.
[15059.44s -> 15061.89s]  Hey, hey, whoa.
[15062.69s -> 15063.49s]  Why'd you do that?
[15075.20s -> 15076.08s]  Why did he just do that?
[15076.80s -> 15079.65s]  And you need money.
[15079.73s -> 15082.37s]  Answer the goddamn question, Rudy, before I brain you.
[15085.18s -> 15086.78s]  You disappoint me, Cole, folks.
[15088.22s -> 15090.30s]  Get back in there and make some lunch, boy.
[15090.30s -> 15091.34s]  I need a confession.
[15095.28s -> 15097.28s]  You can do this in L.A. Noir?
[15097.92s -> 15103.54s]  I didn't know you could, like, ragdoll off a building.
[15108.03s -> 15108.83s]  Holy shit.
[15109.47s -> 15119.26s]  This one's called German 95, 2019, HD trailer.
[15119.26s -> 15126.72s]  And it says, joker, parody.
[15126.72s -> 15128.32s]  Does it help to have someone to talk to?
[15136.83s -> 15141.78s]  You know, my mother always told me.
[15156.48s -> 15161.47s]  Deal is not on the table anymore.
[15162.27s -> 15163.87s]  I don't know what to do with this stuff.
[15163.87s -> 15165.07s]  Is this what you fucking wanted?
[15165.79s -> 15166.67s]  You wanted this shit?
[15173.38s -> 15174.66s]  Spider-Man.
[15174.66s -> 15175.06s]  Hold on.
[15175.06s -> 15175.94s]  I want to see this again.
[15176.74s -> 15178.26s]  Does it help to have someone to talk to?
[15190.14s -> 15191.58s]  You know, my mother always told me.
[15193.98s -> 15195.22s]  Be a good boy.
[15196.02s -> 15209.12s]  By the way, Spider-Man.
[15209.12s -> 15211.36s]  Deal is not on the table anymore.
[15212.16s -> 15213.76s]  I don't know what to do with this stuff.
[15213.76s -> 15214.96s]  Is this what you fucking wanted?
[15219.34s -> 15221.98s]  The age of just deep fakes.
[15221.98s -> 15223.50s]  You could deep fake anything on anyone.
[15224.70s -> 15227.42s]  Deep fake a costume on somebody.
[15227.42s -> 15228.94s]  You don't have to go for Halloween anymore.
[15229.50s -> 15232.22s]  You can just pretend you did a bunch of cool shit.
[15232.22s -> 15235.50s]  Just put on a cool, just have a computer costume on.
[15235.50s -> 15241.26s]  That's a Snapchat filter.
[15250.62s -> 15253.98s]  Still, you don't have to do anything anymore.
[15253.98s -> 15257.65s]  You just have to put a Snapchat filter on
[15257.65s -> 15260.29s]  and then put a fake beach behind you.
[15264.16s -> 15266.22s]  It's the same thing.
[15266.22s -> 15268.14s]  We only use Instagram stories here.
[15272.24s -> 15273.20s]  You want a link to this one?
[15273.84s -> 15276.10s]  I'll give you a link to this one.
[15276.10s -> 15280.45s]  Someone said, why did you turn the face cam off?
[15280.45s -> 15282.37s]  Because I got really sweaty.
[15286.99s -> 15287.95s]  I was laughing too hard.
[15287.95s -> 15288.91s]  Boogers were coming out of my nose
[15288.91s -> 15290.59s]  and I got really sweaty and smelly.
[15291.23s -> 15295.41s]  There you go.
[15295.41s -> 15295.97s]  All right.
[15295.97s -> 15297.65s]  Down to the last 10, I think.
[15299.76s -> 15301.28s]  This one's called Precious Germo.
[15320.14s -> 15321.26s]  Naked.
[15332.14s -> 15340.05s]  The eyes of a killer.
[15347.73s -> 15349.33s]  The eyes of Vaude ruined?
[15350.59s -> 15351.31s]  No, that's all right.
[15354.38s -> 15355.02s]  The Vaude's fine.
[15355.02s -> 15356.06s]  That was Precious Germo.
[15356.06s -> 15358.30s]  It was a lot of particle effects,
[15358.30s -> 15359.82s]  which are really, really cool.
[15362.24s -> 15364.08s]  This is called, can't think of a title for this.
[15364.08s -> 15365.28s]  It's a Germo meme.
[15406.32s -> 15407.76s]  Germo's Last Christmas.
[15411.39s -> 15412.03s]  Let it play.
[15414.30s -> 15415.34s]  Germo's Last Christmas.
[15419.39s -> 15422.62s]  I will light a motherfucker up right now.
[15454.30s -> 15457.90s]  I gotta go.
[15457.90s -> 15458.46s]  I gotta go.
[15458.46s -> 15458.86s]  You know what I mean?
[15458.86s -> 15459.18s]  I gotta go.
[15459.18s -> 15459.90s]  I gotta get out of here.
[15459.90s -> 15460.70s]  I gotta get out of here, man.
[15460.70s -> 15461.26s]  I gotta go.
[15461.26s -> 15461.90s]  I gotta go.
[15493.01s -> 15494.05s]  What is going on?
[15496.05s -> 15503.97s]  Oh, okay.
[15503.97s -> 15505.09s]  That was strange.
[15509.97s -> 15511.81s]  Oh my God.
[15512.85s -> 15514.05s]  What the fuck?
[15516.16s -> 15518.48s]  What in the name of God happened at the end there?
[15534.35s -> 15535.31s]  What the fuck?
[15536.45s -> 15537.57s]  That's terrifying.
[15538.13s -> 15541.34s]  Germo's Last Christmas.
[15541.34s -> 15543.39s]  Oh, all right.
[15543.39s -> 15546.67s]  I gotta get that off the screen into this.
[15546.67s -> 15550.11s]  This is, you know, I don't, well, you know what this is.
[15550.75s -> 15553.23s]  Do I need to even tell you what this is?
[15554.03s -> 15554.43s]  Let's just.
[15575.44s -> 15577.36s]  It only took three weeks to render.
[15578.56s -> 15589.12s]  That's so ridiculous.
[15590.24s -> 15591.28s]  Actually scary, yeah.
[15593.92s -> 15597.20s]  Okay, grass grows, birds fly, sun shines.
[15597.20s -> 15598.72s]  And brother, I hurt people.
[15599.84s -> 15600.96s]  I'm a force of nature.
[15600.96s -> 15603.76s]  But if you were from where I was from, you'd be dead.
[15606.82s -> 15608.74s]  I kind of turned into Voldemort for a second here though.
[15617.71s -> 15619.63s]  This is actually freaking me out.
[15620.27s -> 15622.34s]  I'll give you a link to it though.
[15622.34s -> 15624.98s]  That was a lot of render time.
[15624.98s -> 15625.94s]  A lot of computer time.
[15630.37s -> 15631.01s]  Germo's Scout.
[15636.61s -> 15637.89s]  This one's called the quintessential,
[15637.89s -> 15639.81s]  the most quintessential arcade sound effect.
[15645.76s -> 15647.28s]  Minor prize.
[15647.28s -> 15648.00s]  Go for the major.
[15659.90s -> 15662.62s]  Oh, fuck, it does that every time.
[15662.62s -> 15663.34s]  It does it on purpose.
[15663.34s -> 15663.90s]  It does it on purpose.
[15663.90s -> 15664.54s]  It does it on purpose.
[15666.40s -> 15667.28s]  It's true.
[15668.82s -> 15671.46s]  That's what happens when you walk by every single arcade.
[15671.46s -> 15672.42s]  You just hear that sound.
[15680.22s -> 15682.86s]  Oh, fuck, it does that every time.
[15682.86s -> 15683.58s]  It does it on purpose.
[15683.58s -> 15684.22s]  It does it on purpose.
[15684.94s -> 15689.97s]  Germo, it's been eight hours, please.
[15689.97s -> 15691.33s]  What, like I'm stuck playing the game?
[15691.33s -> 15692.69s]  It didn't take me that long to beat this one.
[15694.02s -> 15694.98s]  They have an update coming up.
[15695.62s -> 15698.59s]  They're adding a whole new arcade.
[15698.59s -> 15699.87s]  Maybe it'll be worth taking a look.
[15700.35s -> 15707.15s]  This one's called F.
[15709.71s -> 15714.19s]  Um, hold on.
[15714.19s -> 15714.75s]  Nobody look.
[15718.96s -> 15719.28s]  Okay.
[15720.32s -> 15723.28s]  If you've, okay, I just, I want to check something.
[15724.80s -> 15729.33s]  If you've never seen, if you've never seen Attack on Titan,
[15730.86s -> 15731.58s]  this is an anime.
[15732.93s -> 15734.21s]  If you've never seen Attack on Titan
[15734.21s -> 15737.89s]  and you don't want to be spoiled on like episode three.
[15743.04s -> 15749.44s]  This is an Attack on Titan like episode three reference.
[15749.44s -> 15750.96s]  I mean, it's like, it just is.
[15750.96s -> 15752.88s]  It's like an early Attack on Titan spoiler.
[15752.88s -> 15756.83s]  Just to tell you, no, just mute me and mute your eyes.
[15766.03s -> 15767.07s]  Do you see my shoe?
[15789.33s -> 15789.57s]  What?
[15800.24s -> 15800.64s]  Why?
[15800.64s -> 15800.96s]  Yes.
[15801.84s -> 15803.52s]  Wait, hold on.
[15803.52s -> 15804.24s]  Hold on.
[15804.24s -> 15805.20s]  Hold on.
[15805.20s -> 15806.32s]  Wait a second.
[15811.74s -> 15812.38s]  Fuck it, yes.
[15826.00s -> 15826.50s]  Wow.
[15827.75s -> 15829.27s]  This is what it looks like up close.
[15846.21s -> 15847.01s]  Turn it off.
[15847.65s -> 15849.16s]  Get to shut this off.
[15849.16s -> 15850.28s]  Shut them all off.
[15850.28s -> 15851.80s]  Turn your lights in your house off too.
[15854.36s -> 15858.90s]  This is great.
[15867.56s -> 15868.36s]  My stomach.
[15870.84s -> 15876.44s]  Things I didn't want to do on camera,
[15876.44s -> 15879.16s]  but did them on camera because I explained how badly
[15879.16s -> 15880.92s]  I didn't want to do it on camera.
[15880.92s -> 15882.20s]  I'll take it for 200 please.
[15889.57s -> 15893.89s]  God, that was fucking funny.
[15894.45s -> 15896.85s]  You guys didn't give this one a chance and should have.
[15903.54s -> 15903.94s]  Link?
[15903.94s -> 15904.42s]  Oh yeah.
[15906.72s -> 15911.83s]  We got three more videos until Community Content Night number two.
[15912.47s -> 15913.60s]  Is that an end?
[15914.24s -> 15915.92s]  Two more.
[15915.92s -> 15917.36s]  Well, three more actually.
[15917.36s -> 15922.58s]  Here comes.
[15923.70s -> 15925.54s]  I actually don't know what the last three are.
[15926.42s -> 15927.70s]  It could be anything.
[15927.70s -> 15931.48s]  This one's called Germa Psycho.
[15934.21s -> 15934.93s]  Okay, here we go.
[15936.64s -> 15939.04s]  I usually lock up one person per stream and I eat the key
[15939.44s -> 15941.28s]  and I've been doing it for about three years now, so.
[15941.28s -> 15941.60s]  What?
[15943.46s -> 15944.90s]  Wait, what did I just say?
[15947.67s -> 15948.39s]  What the fuck?
[15948.39s -> 15949.27s]  When did I say this?
[15951.11s -> 15952.23s]  Yeah, I usually lock up one.
[15953.91s -> 15955.27s]  Is this like out of context?
[15957.04s -> 15958.96s]  Yeah, I usually lock up one person per stream
[15958.96s -> 15961.44s]  and I eat the key and I've been doing it for about three years now, so.
[15978.15s -> 15979.59s]  Life is pain.
[15979.59s -> 15980.39s]  I hate life.
[15980.39s -> 15981.51s]  Just calm down.
[15981.51s -> 15982.71s]  You don't have to worry about it.
[15982.71s -> 15983.59s]  I'm going to kill you.
[15984.15s -> 15986.23s]  You burn your body and eat it.
[15986.23s -> 15988.79s]  Every single bit of that will swallow you whole.
[15988.79s -> 15991.59s]  I'm going to swallow you whole.
[15992.63s -> 15993.67s]  Not so fast.
[15993.67s -> 15997.43s]  This wooden desk, you see, is 445 pounds.
[15997.43s -> 15999.11s]  And with ease, I can just get it.
[15999.11s -> 16000.31s]  I think I just ripped out the ethernet.
[16001.19s -> 16001.59s]  Did I?
[16001.59s -> 16002.09s]  No, I didn't.
[16005.65s -> 16006.61s]  Oh my god.
[16007.65s -> 16010.21s]  I'm scared of my own face.
[16021.54s -> 16023.14s]  What happened in this video?
[16026.82s -> 16028.74s]  When have I said these things?
[16029.14s -> 16031.62s]  I usually lock up one person per stream and I eat the key.
[16031.62s -> 16032.26s]  I know this one.
[16032.26s -> 16033.30s]  And I've been doing it for about three years now, so.
[16038.08s -> 16039.36s]  Life is pain.
[16039.36s -> 16040.48s]  Just calm down.
[16040.48s -> 16041.68s]  You don't have to worry about it.
[16041.68s -> 16042.56s]  I'm going to kill you.
[16043.36s -> 16045.20s]  You burn your body and then eat it.
[16045.20s -> 16047.68s]  Every single bit of that will swallow you whole.
[16047.68s -> 16051.12s]  I'm going to swallow you whole.
[16051.12s -> 16054.64s]  Oh, that's from the Grandpa Does Drugs, right?
[16055.44s -> 16059.44s]  From an old, the old Call of Duty video, okay.
[16060.40s -> 16062.56s]  I was like, when on earth did I do that?
[16064.42s -> 16067.86s]  It's from Black Ops 2, right?
[16067.86s -> 16070.66s]  You see, it's 445 pounds.
[16070.66s -> 16072.42s]  And with ease, I can just get it.
[16072.42s -> 16073.38s]  Nobody used this.
[16076.84s -> 16077.72s]  Nobody used this.
[16078.92s -> 16081.00s]  Was this so bad that nobody used it ever?
[16082.40s -> 16085.20s]  I sat down and I did like a full like pretend to interview the person.
[16086.42s -> 16087.22s]  Does this just suck?
[16087.22s -> 16089.54s]  Is it no, is there no footage here that's usable?
[16090.34s -> 16091.96s]  What could we use it for?
[16092.76s -> 16093.72s]  I don't know.
[16093.72s -> 16098.79s]  Not so fast.
[16098.79s -> 16102.63s]  This wooden desk, you see, is 445 pounds.
[16102.63s -> 16104.23s]  And with ease, I can just get it.
[16104.23s -> 16105.43s]  I think it is from the Ethernet.
[16106.63s -> 16107.67s]  Wait, what do you do with this?
[16113.16s -> 16115.00s]  I guess you don't, I don't know what you use this for.
[16115.64s -> 16118.21s]  Don't worry.
[16118.21s -> 16122.21s]  You're going to get an extra fucking like eight hours of probably not that much.
[16122.21s -> 16125.97s]  You're going to get like an extra like six, five to four to six hours
[16126.77s -> 16128.37s]  of new actions in front of the screen.
[16129.01s -> 16131.49s]  You use it as a segue.
[16131.49s -> 16131.89s]  That's true.
[16135.67s -> 16137.11s]  I don't know about this one.
[16137.19s -> 16142.71s]  So I'm going to, I'm going to play this and then I might have to stop playing this one
[16142.71s -> 16147.70s]  because I see the title and it's, this is, this might be a very quick turn off.
[16148.58s -> 16151.06s]  Star, let's put cigarettes out on my dick.
[16151.06s -> 16151.38s]  Okay.
[16151.38s -> 16153.86s]  So already I know it's not going to work.
[16154.90s -> 16157.70s]  I told you I was fucking pumped up to like do this shit.
[16157.70s -> 16158.66s]  I'm pumped up right now.
[16158.66s -> 16159.38s]  We're both pumped.
[16159.38s -> 16160.58s]  Call us the pump brothers.
[16160.58s -> 16161.86s]  I'm going to teach you how to pull it off.
[16161.86s -> 16162.66s]  Star, are you ready for this?
[16162.66s -> 16163.70s]  I want to see how to pull it off.
[16165.06s -> 16165.70s]  Okay.
[16165.70s -> 16166.74s]  We're not going to play this one.
[16169.28s -> 16170.16s]  That was the last one.
[16190.37s -> 16191.97s]  That was so fucked up.
[16192.69s -> 16193.89s]  That was so fucked up.
[16193.89s -> 16195.01s]  I'm not playing that.
[16195.73s -> 16197.09s]  No, I'm not playing that.
[16197.09s -> 16197.81s]  We'll play this one.
[16209.75s -> 16210.47s]  I said it.
[16211.27s -> 16212.34s]  Yeah.
[16213.22s -> 16214.02s]  Long time ago.
[16215.92s -> 16216.48s]  It's here.
[16216.48s -> 16216.96s]  What's here?
[16219.46s -> 16220.02s]  What's here?
[16223.44s -> 16226.56s]  I know I said this like 10 years ago.
[16227.12s -> 16235.49s]  You just linked me the video.
[16235.49s -> 16236.13s]  Oh, okay.
[16236.13s -> 16236.37s]  Good.
[16237.01s -> 16238.13s]  I'm not clicking it.
[16238.13s -> 16241.99s]  But that, that actually is the end.
[16241.99s -> 16246.36s]  Except, except there's still one more thing.
[16246.92s -> 16248.69s]  That's the end of the videos.
[16248.69s -> 16249.25s]  That's the end of it.
[16249.25s -> 16251.25s]  Thank you everybody for your submissions.
[16253.33s -> 16255.65s]  There's, there's a, there should be.
[16255.65s -> 16256.61s]  Well, let me make sure there is.
[16257.25s -> 16258.82s]  Where is it?
[16258.82s -> 16259.22s]  Where is it?
[16259.22s -> 16259.62s]  Where is it?
[16259.62s -> 16259.94s]  Where is it?
[16259.94s -> 16260.66s]  Where is it?
[16260.66s -> 16261.14s]  There is.
[16261.14s -> 16261.54s]  There is.
[16261.54s -> 16262.50s]  There is, right?
[16262.50s -> 16262.90s]  Is there?
[16263.54s -> 16264.63s]  There is.
[16264.63s -> 16264.87s]  Okay.
[16266.39s -> 16268.63s]  So there are a few songs.
[16268.63s -> 16270.00s]  Do you guys remember?
[16272.90s -> 16273.62s]  Spoiled.
[16273.86s -> 16274.98s]  Do you remember when I did the,
[16274.98s -> 16277.30s]  I told you that the rat, the third rats song.
[16279.01s -> 16281.49s]  I talked about how that this is what it was going to be.
[16281.49s -> 16283.41s]  And I did it and I, and I tried to make it.
[16284.05s -> 16284.77s]  Somebody made it.
[16284.77s -> 16286.61s]  And this is exactly what it was going to be.
[16287.17s -> 16290.77s]  This is the actual, like what the third rats movie song was going to sound like.
[16291.49s -> 16292.15s]  Here you go.
[16304.87s -> 16321.44s]  Yeah.
[16321.44s -> 16325.84s]  And then the horn comes in and then the horn comes in.
[16326.72s -> 16341.00s]  You aren't listening.
[16341.64s -> 16342.20s]  I took off.
[16342.20s -> 16342.44s]  Yeah.
[16343.16s -> 16345.22s]  It's because it was really loud for me.
[16346.79s -> 16347.51s]  You aren't even.
[16347.51s -> 16348.39s]  I didn't mean to not listen.
[16348.39s -> 16350.39s]  I could hear it because it was so loud because I had my.
[16351.51s -> 16353.03s]  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[16353.03s -> 16353.51s]  No, no.
[16354.63s -> 16357.48s]  It was very loud for me.
[16357.48s -> 16359.16s]  So even with it out, I could hear it very clearly.
[16361.99s -> 16364.82s]  No, the horn comes in.
[16366.02s -> 16372.44s]  He hates it.
[16372.44s -> 16372.94s]  What?
[16377.38s -> 16378.26s]  I don't hate it.
[16391.51s -> 16392.87s]  Stop making me shit any grin.
[16392.87s -> 16393.59s]  I don't.
[16393.59s -> 16399.48s]  It's very good.
[16401.48s -> 16403.35s]  The greedy grinner.
[16403.91s -> 16404.39s]  That's me.
[16405.11s -> 16410.56s]  There's also, there's, let's see what this one is.
[16416.15s -> 16417.19s]  I have my first kiss here.
[16417.67s -> 16422.39s]  That's before the play, kid.
[16423.67s -> 16424.71s]  I have my first kiss here.
[16428.80s -> 16429.84s]  That's before the play, kid.
[16432.72s -> 16433.28s]  Big face.
[16433.28s -> 16433.52s]  Yeah.
[16436.92s -> 16437.64s]  Oh, he's grinning.
[16437.64s -> 16438.52s]  He's grinning again.
[16447.59s -> 16450.72s]  This one's pretty good.
[16454.00s -> 16454.80s]  No emotion.
[16455.44s -> 16458.72s]  Why would I do no emotion for a hot single like this?
[16462.24s -> 16466.07s]  Our commercial with me or this?
[16468.87s -> 16471.24s]  React more.
[16471.24s -> 16471.72s]  All right, fine.
[16472.76s -> 16477.51s]  No, I'm not going to react more.
[16479.94s -> 16483.91s]  Why would you want me to turn it like a fucking cartoon?
[16485.35s -> 16486.39s]  Is this what you were looking for?
[16487.51s -> 16488.01s]  Wow.
[16488.98s -> 16490.50s]  What an interesting song this is.
[16496.61s -> 16497.89s]  I especially like this part.
[16498.61s -> 16506.72s]  Are we in sync?
[16510.92s -> 16512.44s]  That's what Mark Zuckerberg does.
[16512.44s -> 16513.16s]  You know what?
[16513.16s -> 16513.80s]  Is that what he does?
[16515.00s -> 16515.80s]  He just goes like,
[16528.79s -> 16541.00s]  I could just like bop my head to this.
[16541.00s -> 16541.96s]  This is a head bopper.
[16543.99s -> 16544.71s]  Dance to the music.
[16562.88s -> 16563.68s]  Thriller shoulder.
[16569.06s -> 16570.58s]  What the fuck is German dancing?
[16570.58s -> 16571.22s]  Why am I dancing?
[16571.22s -> 16572.90s]  Because I'm listening to a community made song.
[16575.30s -> 16577.62s]  I painted my living room wall green.
[16577.62s -> 16578.84s]  I hope it looks all right.
[16580.12s -> 16580.44s]  Did it?
[16580.44s -> 16581.08s]  I hope it did.
[16581.96s -> 16583.35s]  What's the name of the song?
[16583.35s -> 16586.71s]  It's called Jerma 51.
[16586.71s -> 16592.53s]  You want to link to this one?
[16601.33s -> 16602.85s]  And that...
[16602.85s -> 16603.73s]  Wait, we got one more.
[16604.29s -> 16607.19s]  This one is called...
[16607.19s -> 16608.55s]  This one's called Wait on Red.
[16609.43s -> 16613.72s]  It's inspired from the ending screen.
[16617.41s -> 16622.28s]  Don't forget this one.
[16623.73s -> 16624.77s]  So wait, wait.
[16624.77s -> 16625.41s]  What are you linking?
[16625.97s -> 16627.56s]  Let me...
[16627.56s -> 16628.36s]  Don't forget this one.
[16629.73s -> 16630.29s]  Jerma...
[16630.29s -> 16636.48s]  Jackson Jerma duet singing September on stream.
[16636.48s -> 16638.80s]  What are you talking about?
[16639.36s -> 16645.76s]  Did that come in today?
[16646.32s -> 16650.24s]  Because this is all as of like last night.
[16650.24s -> 16650.48s]  Was it...
[16650.48s -> 16651.68s]  Did it come in today?
[16651.68s -> 16653.04s]  Was that like this afternoon?
[16653.76s -> 16656.26s]  That's gonna have to be on the next one.
[16656.90s -> 16659.33s]  It was from 11 hours ago.
[16659.33s -> 16661.94s]  The cutoff was yesterday.
[16661.94s -> 16662.58s]  Who cares?
[16663.14s -> 16669.62s]  I'm trying to listen to a song.
[16670.96s -> 16671.44s]  Fine.
[16671.44s -> 16672.16s]  Link it to me again.
[16673.28s -> 16675.64s]  Follow the rules.
[16678.08s -> 16679.04s]  You are the streamer.
[16679.04s -> 16679.68s]  Make the rules.
[16680.85s -> 16681.41s]  No, no, no.
[16681.41s -> 16682.77s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16682.77s -> 16683.65s]  Save it for next time.
[16684.37s -> 16690.87s]  What?
[16690.87s -> 16691.91s]  Somebody call me a skull?
[16692.47s -> 16697.57s]  Wait, why are you calling me a skull?
[16697.57s -> 16698.53s]  Fuck your rules.
[16699.17s -> 16703.46s]  Do you want me to just fucking sneeze over there?
[16704.34s -> 16706.34s]  And just sneeze into you and have it just...
[16706.34s -> 16707.46s]  You just fall backwards.
[16708.10s -> 16709.94s]  With the might of the air that comes out of my body.
[16715.20s -> 16717.12s]  No, we need content.
[16717.12s -> 16718.96s]  This happens every like 30 or 40 days.
[16720.61s -> 16722.05s]  It's a perfect amount of time.
[16723.59s -> 16724.79s]  Four to five hours.
[16724.79s -> 16727.03s]  That's perfect for like a full community stream.
[16728.56s -> 16729.92s]  Yeah, we want to have to...
[16729.92s -> 16733.04s]  I want this to be like three plus, four plus hours every time.
[16733.68s -> 16740.69s]  I'll sneeze in your face.
[16740.69s -> 16741.41s]  Well, don't do that.
[16743.84s -> 16746.00s]  Give us the post or give us uh oh stinky.
[16747.12s -> 16751.16s]  You're not going to get any of those things.
[16751.80s -> 16754.56s]  Give me the rats link.
[16754.56s -> 16755.60s]  Well, let me link all of these.
[16757.08s -> 16757.88s]  This is the rats one.
[16758.60s -> 16764.21s]  And then this is the one we just listened to.
[16764.85s -> 16771.03s]  I'm not gonna play that video.
[16771.91s -> 16774.72s]  Why would I play that?
[16775.89s -> 16778.13s]  It's like me gnoming myself.
[16778.77s -> 16780.02s]  What's going on?
[16780.02s -> 16780.90s]  Why does my camera do this?
[16787.04s -> 16788.08s]  No, that's it for today.
[16788.80s -> 16790.85s]  See?
[16790.85s -> 16791.73s]  Why does it do that shit?
[16792.29s -> 16801.44s]  So what's going to happen here over the next couple days is tomorrow...
[16801.44s -> 16804.00s]  I have no idea what I'm going to stream tomorrow.
[16809.60s -> 16812.24s]  Because there's like two or three things that I really want to do.
[16812.88s -> 16817.48s]  But I'm not sure if...
[16817.48s -> 16819.00s]  I don't know which one I want to do.
[16819.56s -> 16825.67s]  Because like Outer Worlds is something that I thought I would want to do.
[16826.31s -> 16828.23s]  Dead Rising 2 is something I want to do.
[16830.10s -> 16833.78s]  It's Katamari is another one that would be fun to do like the second Katamari game.
[16835.96s -> 16838.28s]  I'm gonna have to like throw dice in the air.
[16839.08s -> 16839.80s]  I really don't know.
[16845.11s -> 16847.51s]  I'm gonna actually throw dice up in the air.
[16847.51s -> 16849.35s]  And whatever they land on, I'll have numbers for each one.
[16852.23s -> 16852.55s]  We'll see.
[16852.55s -> 16853.35s]  It'll be something fun.
[16854.60s -> 16858.84s]  And then as of this coming weekend here, there's going to be another...
[16858.84s -> 16862.68s]  I'm going to address you directly because I feel like it's more interpersonal that way.
[16863.88s -> 16867.64s]  In like three days, there's going to be another channel in that Discord.
[16867.64s -> 16872.28s]  It's going to be the Green Screen Movie Night DLC for free.
[16872.28s -> 16872.68s]  You're going to go.
[16872.68s -> 16873.64s]  There's going to be two channels.
[16873.64s -> 16879.49s]  One to discuss and one to make suggestions.
[16879.49s -> 16882.37s]  And then the Green Screen stream will happen probably two weeks from now.
[16883.43s -> 16887.89s]  Two to three weeks, depending on how many submissions we get.
[16887.89s -> 16889.25s]  Dead Rising 2 has gambling?
[16889.97s -> 16891.57s]  Well, you just convinced me.
[16894.77s -> 16895.65s]  Eyes up here.
[16904.58s -> 16905.78s]  Fuck do I read these things?
[16911.14s -> 16915.06s]  Anyways, the whole game takes place in Vegas, does it actually?
[16915.06s -> 16915.62s]  Is it for real?
[16915.62s -> 16916.74s]  That's pretty cool actually.
[16919.09s -> 16921.78s]  All right, thank you again.
[16922.84s -> 16925.08s]  I love doing this shit.
[16925.08s -> 16928.60s]  I think there's a ton of people that need to be showcased in this community.
[16928.60s -> 16931.56s]  I think you guys make some of the funniest shit that I've seen.
[16932.12s -> 16936.84s]  They were at least, again, like last time, at least five to 10 of these videos and images
[16937.64s -> 16939.56s]  that made me heart laughing.
[16939.56s -> 16943.64s]  So I cannot wait to give you guys all more material
[16944.69s -> 16948.90s]  because the more material that you have,
[16949.86s -> 16951.86s]  the more shit that you could just come up with.
[16951.86s -> 16955.30s]  And I love every second of it.
[16955.30s -> 16959.51s]  So thank you so much for all of your contributions.
[16959.51s -> 16960.31s]  There's a lot of them.
[16961.03s -> 16962.23s]  People continue to put stuff.
[16962.23s -> 16964.31s]  If you don't know, go to the Discord.
[16964.31s -> 16965.43s]  Community content nights.
[16966.15s -> 16966.95s]  Put something there.
[16967.83s -> 16970.15s]  Art, video, music related.
[16970.15s -> 16971.83s]  Something related to the community or the channel.
[16972.39s -> 16974.68s]  And I can't wait to see it.
[16978.96s -> 16981.12s]  Great fucking job.
[16981.76s -> 17003.96s]  I will see you guys tomorrow for either Dead Rising 2 or Outer Worlds or Katamari or I don't know.
[17003.96s -> 17008.52s]  No, I'm probably not going to play on stream Death Stranding.
[17008.52s -> 17010.24s]  Looks really interesting.
[17010.24s -> 17011.52s]  Dead Rising 2 off the record.
[17012.08s -> 17013.92s]  Well, you put an emote on it.
[17013.92s -> 17021.33s]  So it really is going to come down to what I want to do tomorrow.
[17022.05s -> 17023.41s]  I'm going to get up in the morning and I'm going to go, you know what?
[17023.41s -> 17023.97s]  That's what I want.
[17023.97s -> 17025.25s]  I'm going to do Dead Rising 2.
[17025.89s -> 17027.65s]  Or like, no, I want to play like an RPG.
[17028.45s -> 17032.90s]  It's how I get up in the morning tomorrow.
[17032.90s -> 17036.55s]  Death Stranding is an awful stream game.
[17036.55s -> 17038.39s]  I mean, it looks like people are having fun with it.
[17038.39s -> 17040.07s]  I know a ton of people are streaming it right now.
[17044.36s -> 17058.37s]  I don't think I want to play it on stream though.
[17058.37s -> 17059.89s]  More like walking.
[17060.61s -> 17063.03s]  It's all good.
[17064.02s -> 17064.98s]  But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[17064.98s -> 17065.94s]  We'll figure it out.
[17065.94s -> 17067.30s]  I'll be in the pre-stream.
[17067.30s -> 17069.08s]  You guys will see me in the pre-stream.
[17069.64s -> 17073.44s]  At least an hour or so before the stream starts in the first place and we'll figure it out.
[17073.44s -> 17074.32s]  We'll go over what we can do.
[17074.88s -> 17078.24s]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[17078.88s -> 17085.94s]  So before Community Content Night number three happens,
[17086.74s -> 17089.46s]  there will be a second green screen.
[17089.46s -> 17092.13s]  So keep that in mind.
[17092.69s -> 17096.24s]  The one that will happen in next month,
[17098.08s -> 17101.86s]  I might push it back a few extra weeks, like a week or two,
[17101.86s -> 17105.54s]  just to make sure if people want to get some of the second green screen stuff in, they can.
[17106.10s -> 17113.28s]  Is Community Night monthly?
[17114.66s -> 17123.88s]  Monthly with an asterisk because it's probably going to end up to be every month and a half.
[17126.61s -> 17128.37s]  Because the last one was in September.
[17128.37s -> 17131.89s]  September like 20th or like September like 18th or something.
[17132.61s -> 17136.71s]  And now we're at November 10th.
[17136.71s -> 17138.79s]  So it's probably going to be like bimonthly.
[17139.43s -> 17145.20s]  Because that does have to be enough to do a stream on it.
[17145.20s -> 17150.80s]  So that channel will load up every month or two.
[17150.80s -> 17153.76s]  When there's enough to do like a three, four hour stream, then hell yeah.
[17160.28s -> 17161.40s]  Thanks a lot, though.
[17161.40s -> 17166.37s]  It's still the same.
[17167.40s -> 17168.12s]  It'll always be.
[17168.12s -> 17168.84s]  It's bilateral.
[17168.84s -> 17169.64s]  It's always going to be you.
[17174.53s -> 17175.17s]  Did he watch?
[17175.49s -> 17175.97s]  Stinky.
[17175.97s -> 17176.93s]  Yeah, I did.
[17176.93s -> 17178.29s]  I watched it twice.
[17178.29s -> 17180.29s]  Once in slow motion to make sure I could get the whole thing.
[17180.85s -> 17184.64s]  But let's do the bits.
[17185.28s -> 17186.66s]  See you tomorrow.
[17186.66s -> 17187.94s]  Take care of yourselves.
[17187.94s -> 17192.60s]  If you're sticking around, we've got a little bit of extra talking to do here.
[17193.16s -> 17200.16s]  So we had snowflakes.
[17200.16s -> 17201.28s]  Am I right for 250?
[17201.28s -> 17203.60s]  They said my PC blue screened earlier this week.
[17204.32s -> 17208.40s]  Got it working this week at about $600 worth of parts later.
[17209.48s -> 17210.20s]  That's not good.
[17210.84s -> 17213.04s]  I didn't get around to posting on the Discord.
[17213.04s -> 17214.32s]  Did a few more portraits.
[17215.30s -> 17217.06s]  Plus watermarked the older one.
[17217.06s -> 17220.82s]  Oh, stick those in there.
[17221.62s -> 17222.50s]  Stick those in there.
[17224.15s -> 17225.35s]  Stick those in there.
[17225.35s -> 17226.31s]  Stick those in there.
[17231.27s -> 17232.79s]  These are so good.
[17240.21s -> 17244.93s]  Now everybody just everybody just left their portraits.
[17247.54s -> 17248.90s]  We saw two of these already.
[17254.82s -> 17258.04s]  Uh, I watermarked the older ones.
[17258.04s -> 17260.52s]  There is a glue man and auto portrait.
[17261.16s -> 17263.03s]  Catching up on all VODs.
[17263.03s -> 17264.55s]  Did Kim enjoy the portrait?
[17264.55s -> 17265.99s]  I'll upload them to my Insta.
[17265.99s -> 17266.79s]  Same as the watermark.
[17266.79s -> 17267.51s]  Hope that's chill.
[17273.97s -> 17275.25s]  Yeah, they're fucking incredible.
[17275.89s -> 17280.71s]  This is fucking unbelievable.
[17280.71s -> 17281.27s]  Like, all right.
[17282.79s -> 17284.15s]  This was technically...
[17284.15s -> 17286.47s]  Technically it was supposed to be there yesterday.
[17286.47s -> 17289.49s]  This was supposed to be there yesterday.
[17289.49s -> 17291.17s]  Because their computer fucked up.
[17291.17s -> 17291.67s]  Okay?
[17294.21s -> 17294.93s]  Right?
[17294.93s -> 17297.72s]  This is not breaking any rules.
[17298.28s -> 17299.80s]  This was supposed to be submitted yesterday.
[17302.92s -> 17306.18s]  But look at this.
[17306.18s -> 17311.30s]  I promise you guys this is not just like a close-up of like inside of my nose.
[17311.30s -> 17320.20s]  Let me get this on the viewing angle here.
[17327.22s -> 17328.50s]  I thought this was a photo.
[17329.14s -> 17332.18s]  That's how ridiculous this is.
[17345.41s -> 17346.05s]  Are you kidding me?
[17348.31s -> 17349.11s]  Look at that.
[17349.75s -> 17351.43s]  That's unbelievable.
[17352.71s -> 17354.63s]  That's unbelievable.
[17355.78s -> 17357.14s]  This is a camera.
[17357.14s -> 17358.02s]  This is a photo.
[17364.23s -> 17365.91s]  I had I gotta break the rule.
[17372.76s -> 17373.32s]  You know?
[17373.32s -> 17373.82s]  Okay.
[17374.52s -> 17376.44s]  My like mother would love this.
[17380.87s -> 17382.39s]  Look at this like detail.
[17384.98s -> 17386.42s]  I can't even describe how good this is.
[17390.85s -> 17391.89s]  Nice work.
[17391.89s -> 17392.45s]  Seriously.
[17393.41s -> 17397.09s]  That's like a 10 out of 10.
[17401.70s -> 17402.34s]  Yeah, they drew this.
[17402.34s -> 17402.98s]  They drew this.
[17403.62s -> 17406.76s]  And there's another one.
[17407.88s -> 17409.40s]  The other one is of Glooman.
[17414.00s -> 17414.96s]  And wait a minute.
[17414.96s -> 17415.60s]  Oh, please.
[17416.24s -> 17417.52s]  Wait, please.
[17417.52s -> 17418.80s]  Oh my god.
[17418.80s -> 17420.56s]  I'm gonna like actually...
[17420.56s -> 17421.36s]  I'm gonna print this.
[17421.92s -> 17423.28s]  It's my favorite character.
[17426.76s -> 17427.08s]  Yes!
[17428.69s -> 17429.81s]  It's Bugleberry.
[17429.81s -> 17430.77s]  There's a...
[17430.77s -> 17435.52s]  You did a Bugleberry.
[17435.52s -> 17436.32s]  Fantastic.
[17436.32s -> 17436.82s]  Hold on.
[17437.36s -> 17451.83s]  It's wild.
[17451.83s -> 17459.49s]  And there's that one and then there's a Glooman as well.
[17465.56s -> 17466.28s]  Best car...
[17466.28s -> 17467.72s]  Best worst character ever.
[17468.69s -> 17470.77s]  Speaking of best worst characters ever.
[17470.77s -> 17484.53s]  There's another one.
[17484.53s -> 17485.65s]  Good shit.
[17485.65s -> 17493.56s]  Let's get it in close.
[17494.12s -> 17505.59s]  This is the kind of shit that I would print out all three of these
[17506.45s -> 17509.41s]  and put them in small frames and have it decorate my entryway.
[17516.29s -> 17517.25s]  That's incredible.
[17518.32s -> 17518.96s]  Do it then.
[17518.96s -> 17519.60s]  Maybe I will.
[17524.31s -> 17525.19s]  Thank you so much.
[17525.19s -> 17527.59s]  Sorry you couldn't get it in by today.
[17529.20s -> 17530.64s]  But that sucks here about your computer.
[17530.64s -> 17531.52s]  That was Snowflakes.
[17531.52s -> 17533.14s]  Am I right?
[17533.22s -> 17536.32s]  Or Sneewluckeys.
[17536.32s -> 17542.34s]  With those insane incredible pieces of art.
[17542.34s -> 17543.06s]  Thank you for those.
[17547.72s -> 17551.68s]  We had 250 bits from Espada.
[17551.68s -> 17553.76s]  They say checks taste like shit.
[17553.76s -> 17554.16s]  I agree.
[17558.64s -> 17559.44s]  Checks do.
[17559.44s -> 17560.24s]  I don't like them.
[17560.24s -> 17561.04s]  I think they're very bad.
[17561.60s -> 17563.48s]  I agree with...
[17563.48s -> 17564.44s]  Don't break everything.
[17566.50s -> 17568.42s]  Every time you hear noise like that,
[17569.40s -> 17573.08s]  that's me raising my arms to talk with my hands
[17573.08s -> 17574.76s]  and smashing into something on my desk.
[17575.70s -> 17576.98s]  That's why that happens.
[17580.61s -> 17581.49s]  Like me putting my hands up.
[17581.49s -> 17588.66s]  Like moving my hands around.
[17588.66s -> 17590.02s]  Thank you Topac for the 250.
[17590.02s -> 17591.46s]  Shido was alive and well with the whole gang.
[17591.46s -> 17594.10s]  They've released a new music video and they're coming for you next.
[17594.66s -> 17601.01s]  It's a sweet victory.
[17601.01s -> 17601.81s]  Automaton.
[17609.57s -> 17616.04s]  Thank you, Topac.
[17616.04s -> 17619.24s]  Hey, thank you Stevie the XEV for the 400 bits.
[17620.74s -> 17623.30s]  They say I had a dream about you two nights ago
[17623.30s -> 17627.22s]  where you were hosting some strange who wants to be a millionaire event IRL with fans
[17627.22s -> 17628.34s]  and viewers you invited.
[17628.90s -> 17631.78s]  Viewers who lost you started openly taunting
[17632.74s -> 17634.02s]  and mocking each time.
[17634.90s -> 17638.40s]  My friend got up and nominated me after their turn
[17638.40s -> 17639.68s]  in which you gave me a hug
[17639.68s -> 17641.44s]  and the event turned into some jackbox game
[17641.44s -> 17643.76s]  where the answer is picked by majority vote by fans.
[17644.48s -> 17646.48s]  Of course, the first answer was feet.
[17647.04s -> 17648.88s]  Feetsies in which you overreacted.
[17661.64s -> 17665.81s]  At least I wasn't trying to like chase you and kill you.
[17666.29s -> 17668.13s]  Like some people have weird dreams like that.
[17668.93s -> 17673.72s]  But thank you, Stevie.
[17673.72s -> 17675.08s]  Sad Vega, thanks for the 250.
[17675.08s -> 17676.60s]  You talk about how you want new emotes.
[17676.60s -> 17678.04s]  Don't forget Jerma infected.
[17678.04s -> 17679.08s]  Jerma test.
[17679.08s -> 17681.24s]  Someone even shrunk it down and made it look really good.
[17684.10s -> 17685.70s]  We're gonna, you know what we're gonna have to do?
[17685.70s -> 17686.66s]  Pause the music for a second.
[17687.30s -> 17690.71s]  We're going to have to do a night
[17690.71s -> 17696.18s]  where the point of the stream is to add emotes.
[17696.74s -> 17701.11s]  You gotta catch me on camera, on stream.
[17701.11s -> 17708.04s]  And we do it on stream.
[17708.04s -> 17710.20s]  This is, I don't know, this will probably take a couple hours.
[17710.84s -> 17716.39s]  I will even title the stream like I'm just putting up new emotes.
[17716.39s -> 17717.03s]  Don't watch.
[17721.17s -> 17722.69s]  There'd be no reason to watch.
[17722.69s -> 17723.57s]  But you got me.
[17723.57s -> 17724.61s]  And you got me on camera.
[17724.61s -> 17726.29s]  And let's put in like 10 new emotes.
[17726.85s -> 17746.07s]  We'll probably do that at some point soon.
[17746.07s -> 17746.63s]  Not tomorrow.
[17746.63s -> 17748.15s]  No, tomorrow, I'm gonna play a game tomorrow.
[17748.71s -> 17753.62s]  Hey Stinky, thanks for the 250.
[17753.62s -> 17754.74s]  They say eat boogers.
[17755.67s -> 17756.71s]  Sometimes you do accidentally.
[17756.71s -> 17757.75s]  Everybody does.
[17757.75s -> 17758.23s]  It's okay.
[17761.80s -> 17764.04s]  Thank you, Alamanda for the 1500 bits.
[17764.60s -> 17768.76s]  They say, hey Jerma, I know I really love your streams
[17768.76s -> 17770.44s]  because none of my friends know who you are.
[17771.00s -> 17773.88s]  And yet I still, I love it still.
[17773.88s -> 17775.08s]  Here's a joke as payment.
[17777.49s -> 17791.28s]  My girlfriend has a, not allergy.
[17791.92s -> 17800.44s]  Something, something, something.
[17801.00s -> 17806.10s]  That is like another part of the joke.
[17806.10s -> 17807.14s]  I just didn't write it.
[17807.86s -> 17810.08s]  I didn't read it.
[17810.64s -> 17811.28s]  That's not bad.
[17811.28s -> 17812.88s]  But I don't even know why I stopped.
[17812.88s -> 17820.04s]  I don't know.
[17820.04s -> 17822.87s]  So you admit that you're, I'm not the joker.
[17825.67s -> 17829.11s]  I don't even, I can't, I'm trying to piece this like riddle joke together.
[17829.11s -> 17834.60s]  I can't, I, thank you for the incredible 1500 bits.
[17838.60s -> 17841.40s]  But it doesn't matter if your friends don't know who I am.
[17841.40s -> 17847.76s]  It's all good.
[17849.04s -> 17850.32s]  Maybe they'll find eventually.
[17851.46s -> 17855.62s]  Just link them to the screaming, crying, farting, face slap video.
[17855.62s -> 17857.22s]  I'm sure there'll be a fan immediately.
[17860.72s -> 17861.92s]  No, thanks for the $15 though.
[17861.92s -> 17862.32s]  Seriously.
[17862.32s -> 17865.12s]  Thank you, Doc3660 for the 300 bits.
[17866.95s -> 17868.31s]  Jerma, I could really use some advice.
[17868.31s -> 17870.55s]  I'm 22 right now and I'm really skinny.
[17870.55s -> 17875.89s]  I want to gain muscle and get bigger, but not sure where to start.
[17875.89s -> 17879.25s]  Do I eat like crazy for a month, get fat and then hit the gym?
[17879.97s -> 17882.29s]  Do I just hit the gym right away and eat more at the same time?
[17882.29s -> 17883.01s]  Where do I start?
[17883.01s -> 17883.49s]  Thanks a lot.
[17888.28s -> 17895.25s]  Um, depending on how, honestly, you just have to eat well.
[17895.81s -> 17897.75s]  You have to eat a lot of protein.
[17897.75s -> 17900.39s]  You have to take in a lot of protein and take in a lot of good fats.
[17902.80s -> 17907.28s]  Don't just eat McDonald's and Papa Gino's and Burger King and shit.
[17907.28s -> 17912.74s]  And you'll get, yeah, you'll gain weight, all of it in your ass and in your stomach
[17912.74s -> 17914.10s]  and maybe a little bit on your face.
[17914.10s -> 17920.80s]  The rest of you won't get anything.
[17920.80s -> 17927.16s]  You need to eat quality protein, quality food, high calorie foods
[17928.55s -> 17929.59s]  that aren't junk.
[17933.91s -> 17934.79s]  Eat good fats.
[17935.78s -> 17937.75s]  That's like peanut butter.
[17937.75s -> 17947.62s]  That's like different oils, like olive oil, cans of tuna straight out of the can.
[17947.62s -> 17948.58s]  That's what I did.
[17948.58s -> 17949.70s]  But I'm crazy.
[17950.50s -> 17956.21s]  Don't like do the shit that I did.
[17956.21s -> 17959.73s]  If you want, I like, I can't give you like advice that a doctor would give you.
[17959.73s -> 17963.99s]  That's like actually good advice because if I told my doctor that I was eating
[17963.99s -> 17967.60s]  like two or three cans of tuna a day, they'd probably be like,
[17967.60s -> 17968.32s]  why, what are you doing?
[17968.32s -> 17968.96s]  Don't do that.
[17968.96s -> 17970.00s]  That's terrible.
[17970.00s -> 17977.67s]  And I'd be like, well, I had to get big.
[17977.67s -> 17980.55s]  The reason why I ate a lot of tuna fish is because it's cheap.
[17980.55s -> 17986.98s]  Because if you need to eat a lot of food, you know, it can get expensive,
[17986.98s -> 17991.03s]  especially if you eat, you know, if you're trying to take in more than 2,
[17991.03s -> 17996.87s]  300, like 2,500 calories a day that you're trying to work off and like build muscle,
[17996.87s -> 17998.18s]  it can get expensive.
[18005.27s -> 18007.91s]  Don't get mercury poisoning from eating straight tuna for three weeks.
[18007.91s -> 18008.63s]  That's what I'm telling you.
[18008.63s -> 18009.27s]  Don't listen to me.
[18018.07s -> 18020.47s]  Just eat good food and eat.
[18021.35s -> 18023.91s]  Don't just eat one or two times a day like everybody does.
[18025.43s -> 18026.31s]  You should be eating.
[18026.95s -> 18029.75s]  You should be constantly giving your body energy.
[18031.25s -> 18034.21s]  So that's not two huge meals a day.
[18034.93s -> 18039.81s]  That's four, five, six small meals over the course of the day.
[18039.81s -> 18051.56s]  It's actually much better for you to eat smaller meals than huge ones.
[18054.40s -> 18055.68s]  Constant energy.
[18055.68s -> 18056.64s]  Drink lots of water.
[18059.33s -> 18061.57s]  Guys, you shouldn't be listening to me ever because I...
[18062.69s -> 18064.53s]  Okay, I'm going to say something here and then people are going to be like,
[18064.53s -> 18065.81s]  you're fucking insane.
[18065.81s -> 18066.53s]  All right, I know.
[18067.25s -> 18069.01s]  But listen to me.
[18069.01s -> 18069.65s]  Are you listening?
[18069.65s -> 18070.05s]  Listen to me.
[18070.05s -> 18070.45s]  You know what I mean?
[18071.25s -> 18071.73s]  Listen to me.
[18071.73s -> 18072.45s]  Listen to me about this.
[18072.45s -> 18072.93s]  You know what I'm saying?
[18073.81s -> 18079.19s]  I used to just eat out of the jar tahini paste
[18080.26s -> 18083.30s]  because it's the most calorie dense food on earth.
[18089.68s -> 18095.57s]  One tablespoon of tahini paste is 89 calories.
[18099.83s -> 18101.43s]  Like Winnie the Pooh.
[18114.45s -> 18118.61s]  But tahini, it's so calorie dense.
[18118.61s -> 18120.37s]  It's sesame seeds.
[18120.37s -> 18123.73s]  Tahini is ground up sesame seeds.
[18123.73s -> 18125.89s]  Toasted ground hulled sesame.
[18127.27s -> 18134.69s]  It's the most calorie dense food in the world.
[18134.69s -> 18135.81s]  It's like peanut butter.
[18136.45s -> 18138.53s]  If peanut butter took out all like the...
[18139.96s -> 18141.32s]  It's good for you.
[18141.32s -> 18142.36s]  Tahini is good for you.
[18142.36s -> 18144.20s]  Just not a jar of it.
[18144.20s -> 18148.29s]  It's got polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats.
[18148.29s -> 18149.57s]  It's got no cholesterol.
[18152.90s -> 18154.10s]  It's just don't eat a jar of it.
[18154.10s -> 18155.06s]  But don't listen to me.
[18155.70s -> 18156.34s]  I'm wrong.
[18156.34s -> 18157.06s]  And I know I am.
[18157.62s -> 18163.27s]  But I was putting tahini paste in place of stuff like mayonnaise.
[18163.27s -> 18165.59s]  Like if I made a sandwich like, you know,
[18165.59s -> 18168.39s]  sandwich with a lettuce, tomato, a little bit of onion,
[18168.39s -> 18172.95s]  some like deli turkey, a slice of cheese, tahini paste.
[18174.00s -> 18176.56s]  Because it was going to add like 200 calories to the meal.
[18176.56s -> 18181.19s]  What do you mean this keeps getting worse?
[18181.19s -> 18182.63s]  Are you eating a turkey sandwich is bad?
[18182.63s -> 18183.59s]  What are you talking about?
[18183.59s -> 18197.12s]  How have I not gotten diabetes from these foods?
[18197.12s -> 18199.48s]  There's like no sugar in tahini.
[18201.57s -> 18202.37s]  There's nothing...
[18202.37s -> 18203.09s]  Tahini is good.
[18203.73s -> 18205.09s]  Tahini is not bad for you.
[18207.54s -> 18208.98s]  Tahini, tahini three more times.
[18208.98s -> 18210.18s]  Tahini, tahini.
[18210.18s -> 18212.36s]  Hummus is another one, yeah.
[18222.20s -> 18223.00s]  Eggs, yep.
[18224.66s -> 18225.86s]  Guys, everything is bad.
[18227.00s -> 18229.92s]  Everything is bad for you.
[18229.92s -> 18231.04s]  If you eat a shitload of eggs,
[18231.04s -> 18233.60s]  your cholesterol is going to go skyrocketing.
[18233.60s -> 18235.78s]  You eat a shitload of fucking fish,
[18235.78s -> 18236.90s]  you're going to get mercury poisoning.
[18237.54s -> 18240.45s]  You eat a bunch of steak, you're going to get fat.
[18242.53s -> 18243.89s]  Everything sucks.
[18243.89s -> 18250.53s]  Just mix them all together and eat it like five times a day.
[18252.04s -> 18252.52s]  Slowly.
[18256.60s -> 18257.80s]  Just dump a beer in there too.
[18258.44s -> 18258.92s]  And blend.
[18267.65s -> 18270.21s]  No, honestly without fucking around and no jokes and everything,
[18270.21s -> 18271.49s]  the best advice I can give you is
[18272.92s -> 18275.72s]  eat high quality food more often.
[18276.87s -> 18279.51s]  Don't just get fat to burn it off
[18279.51s -> 18283.75s]  because burning fat is actually way harder than building muscle.
[18283.75s -> 18285.83s]  Sometimes you just won't get rid of it.
[18285.83s -> 18287.11s]  It'll just be there for life.
[18292.95s -> 18293.99s]  Just don't get fat.
[18295.88s -> 18296.92s]  I'm not a dietician.
[18296.92s -> 18298.92s]  I just told you I put tahini paste on everything.
[18301.68s -> 18303.76s]  She would probably monk a ass when you told her that.
[18306.31s -> 18310.95s]  And yes, I said her because my nutritionist was...
[18312.31s -> 18314.55s]  I'm like bringing up people in my life.
[18315.27s -> 18322.42s]  I'm like going through people in my life right now.
[18323.14s -> 18325.78s]  Nutritionists, the people that like helped me do things.
[18337.24s -> 18338.36s]  No, don't eat tahini.
[18338.36s -> 18339.24s]  I never said that.
[18339.24s -> 18340.20s]  It's don't do that.
[18341.22s -> 18341.86s]  Cut the music.
[18344.64s -> 18347.43s]  You should be doing a balanced diet.
[18347.43s -> 18352.31s]  Don't put tahini paste, like a bunch of it on your sandwich.
[18353.04s -> 18355.28s]  It's a bad idea.
[18355.44s -> 18357.35s]  All right, good.
[18357.35s -> 18357.99s]  Don't do that.
[18358.55s -> 18361.03s]  Eat some peanut butter on a sandwich toast.
[18361.03s -> 18362.92s]  That's what I used to do before bed.
[18362.92s -> 18367.16s]  I would spread peanut butter onto a piece of just regular toast,
[18367.16s -> 18367.88s]  like a good amount of it,
[18367.88s -> 18371.65s]  and I would eat that for a late night snack.
[18371.65s -> 18372.61s]  Peanut butter is very dense.
[18372.61s -> 18376.02s]  It's very heavy, very calorie dense, but very good for you.
[18376.02s -> 18381.59s]  Get the real stuff.
[18381.59s -> 18383.03s]  Does tahini paste taste good?
[18383.03s -> 18384.66s]  No.
[18384.66s -> 18386.58s]  In hummus, when it's mixed together with stuff, yeah.
[18386.58s -> 18390.34s]  It's just very, very, very thick and very, very, very distinctive.
[18390.34s -> 18393.84s]  It almost like coats your whole mouth and throat.
[18393.84s -> 18403.41s]  It's hard to eat.
[18403.41s -> 18404.77s]  Anyways, good luck to you.
[18404.77s -> 18407.51s]  Seriously, I had a lot of trouble when I was younger,
[18407.51s -> 18410.39s]  10, 15 plus years ago, trying to put on weight.
[18410.39s -> 18412.42s]  It's a never-ending battle.
[18412.42s -> 18415.68s]  Just don't do anything unhealthy,
[18415.68s -> 18418.24s]  because you'll cause more problems than you will fix.
[18418.24s -> 18423.46s]  I wish you luck.
[18423.46s -> 18425.86s]  Hey, Large27, thanks for the thousand bits.
[18425.86s -> 18427.54s]  No message, just 10 bucks.
[18427.54s -> 18430.66s]  Thank you.
[18430.66s -> 18434.26s]  Dino Pulse, thanks for the five hundred bits.
[18434.26s -> 18437.86s]  Can you explain the breaking spamming rules problem that chat has?
[18437.86s -> 18439.86s]  They are acting like a hive mind,
[18439.86s -> 18442.90s]  and that's why the art's been depicting them like robots.
[18442.90s -> 18444.02s]  Some of us are human here.
[18444.02s -> 18446.98s]  Not to be rude, just wishing us people in chat
[18446.98s -> 18449.30s]  would have a much more organic relationship with you, Jerma,
[18449.30s -> 18450.18s]  like other streamers.
[18457.73s -> 18470.12s]  What do you mean?
[18470.12s -> 18471.32s]  Organic relationship?
[18474.12s -> 18477.16s]  It's hard to have an organic relationship with anybody
[18478.47s -> 18481.91s]  when thousands of people are all saying different things at the same time.
[18489.35s -> 18490.79s]  Assimilate the thinker.
[18491.19s -> 18505.22s]  I think it's fun when chat kind of goes off the rails.
[18507.84s -> 18510.64s]  It's fun to see the collective unit doing things.
[18511.20s -> 18520.24s]  But in regards to chat to broadcaster to back to viewer,
[18520.96s -> 18524.44s]  there's a lot of people here.
[18526.15s -> 18532.79s]  So there's, I don't know what you mean by organic relationship.
[18533.35s -> 18536.08s]  Uh oh, stinky.
[18536.64s -> 18541.28s]  Why are you guys still writing this?
[18541.28s -> 18542.56s]  It's been like two hours.
[18545.96s -> 18550.20s]  No, I like to enjoy things as a group on Twitch.
[18551.80s -> 18554.60s]  And sure, when I do things like these community nights,
[18555.48s -> 18559.72s]  we're showcasing single people that make something or do something,
[18560.36s -> 18562.28s]  but we all collectively enjoy it as a group.
[18564.00s -> 18568.56s]  It's like impossible for me to ever give anybody like personal attention.
[18570.05s -> 18572.45s]  I'm not sure if this is where you're going with this at all,
[18572.45s -> 18575.70s]  but I prefer it that way.
[18576.26s -> 18578.05s]  This is a meme?
[18585.22s -> 18586.18s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[18589.24s -> 18592.44s]  I like it when we all enjoy things together as a group.
[18594.79s -> 18598.47s]  Because when you start trying to give personal attention
[18598.47s -> 18601.11s]  to people that are in chat or in the Discord,
[18602.68s -> 18603.56s]  it's hard to keep up.
[18606.56s -> 18609.20s]  And I've been guilty of doing stuff like this before,
[18609.20s -> 18611.52s]  trying to talk to people and see what's up with this
[18611.52s -> 18612.32s]  and what's up with that.
[18612.32s -> 18616.84s]  And you kind of get lost because there's a lot of voices.
[18622.02s -> 18624.58s]  So I like to keep my stream.
[18625.54s -> 18628.34s]  Like we're all just sitting in a giant auditorium,
[18628.90s -> 18630.18s]  laughing at stuff.
[18630.18s -> 18632.32s]  And then when the lights go off,
[18632.88s -> 18634.79s]  I put up a giant megaphone that says,
[18635.43s -> 18636.47s]  everybody go home.
[18637.03s -> 18640.71s]  Somebody might throw something at me.
[18640.71s -> 18643.04s]  And it's like, hey, fucking asshole.
[18643.04s -> 18644.32s]  And then they run out the back.
[18645.04s -> 18652.66s]  But I like enjoying things as a group.
[18653.30s -> 18658.18s]  Personal attention can get, it can get muddy,
[18658.74s -> 18661.54s]  especially because considering I don't really know
[18663.44s -> 18667.03s]  really, like really any of you.
[18667.59s -> 18670.98s]  Maybe some of you.
[18670.98s -> 18673.30s]  I like the Borg approach.
[18679.22s -> 18681.38s]  I've met some of you guys in person.
[18685.52s -> 18688.08s]  Personal attention in parasocial relationships is scary.
[18688.64s -> 18693.08s]  Yeah, I just want to keep expectations
[18693.08s -> 18694.60s]  completely where I want them.
[18695.40s -> 18697.32s]  And that's auditorium full of people
[18697.32s -> 18699.32s]  that are collectively all in the same place
[18699.32s -> 18700.28s]  enjoying the same things.
[18708.69s -> 18709.19s]  Robots.
[18710.85s -> 18712.37s]  So I was at Target today.
[18712.61s -> 18720.40s]  I love each and every one of you as the unit.
[18720.96s -> 18723.54s]  Look, you ever seen the movie?
[18723.54s -> 18725.54s]  Okay, we're going to go on a movie rant here.
[18726.10s -> 18729.24s]  Okay, God.
[18729.88s -> 18740.40s]  Now, I hope you guys understand what I mean.
[18741.04s -> 18749.12s]  I love the community, but I like to keep it
[18749.12s -> 18750.64s]  an open, fun community.
[18751.44s -> 18755.00s]  I would never, I'm probably never going to be
[18755.00s -> 18756.52s]  in one of those scenarios where I will,
[18757.32s -> 18759.73s]  because sometimes people say, hey, like,
[18759.73s -> 18762.69s]  you know, then this is nothing against anybody at all.
[18763.25s -> 18765.27s]  You know, people be like, hey, I'll be,
[18766.15s -> 18766.87s]  I'll be at X.
[18766.87s -> 18767.83s]  Are you going to be there too?
[18768.63s -> 18770.55s]  And it's like, I probably not.
[18781.40s -> 18781.88s]  Meetups.
[18781.88s -> 18783.24s]  Oh, no, that's completely different though,
[18783.24s -> 18786.34s]  because that's, you know, hey, this is something
[18786.34s -> 18790.66s]  that I want us to do at this event and go.
[18795.62s -> 18796.58s]  Find toothpick.
[18796.58s -> 18799.14s]  Yeah. And if you look, there's been plenty of people.
[18800.56s -> 18802.48s]  And I've recently too, this is not just
[18803.28s -> 18804.96s]  something that happened like years ago.
[18805.60s -> 18808.88s]  Within the last six months, people have just kind of
[18808.88s -> 18810.48s]  flagged me down in random places.
[18811.81s -> 18813.97s]  Has nothing to do with being on stream or anything.
[18813.97s -> 18815.09s]  And not like a gaming event.
[18815.09s -> 18818.16s]  It's just like, hi, I'm going to talk to you.
[18818.16s -> 18819.84s]  Or like, I'm going to hang out and I'll talk to you.
[18822.02s -> 18824.26s]  So this is not anything to do above that.
[18826.39s -> 18827.11s]  Vegas is huge.
[18827.11s -> 18831.38s]  Oh yeah. It's way bigger than like the Boston area
[18832.02s -> 18834.82s]  in regards to just pure volume and places to go
[18834.82s -> 18836.42s]  and where you can run into people.
[18839.41s -> 18844.42s]  But I like the madness in chat to answer that question.
[18849.09s -> 18853.81s]  To a degree, to a degree.
[18853.81s -> 18861.89s]  I'm happy that fame hasn't consumed you.
[18864.39s -> 18865.43s]  I think I'm incapable.
[18865.99s -> 18871.49s]  I think I might just be dumb enough to like
[18871.49s -> 18873.09s]  not be capable of that.
[18873.09s -> 18876.40s]  Like the sensor of my brain that could like turn that on.
[18877.12s -> 18879.52s]  I don't think it's worked since I was like fucking 19.
[18880.16s -> 18889.83s]  He's got a really low IQ.
[18891.01s -> 18893.01s]  He always was an egomaniac.
[18898.58s -> 18899.70s]  He's a karate kid.
[18899.70s -> 18900.66s]  That's right.
[18900.66s -> 18901.62s]  It all turned off.
[18908.85s -> 18909.73s]  I'd love to meet him.
[18909.73s -> 18910.69s]  I'd love to meet you too.
[18911.91s -> 18912.79s]  It'd be great.
[18912.79s -> 18913.91s]  I'm sure it would be really fun.
[18915.14s -> 18917.14s]  But I ain't going to give out my personal phone number.
[18926.28s -> 18928.21s]  Why? I don't know.
[18928.93s -> 18930.21s]  Anyways, let's keep going.
[18930.21s -> 18930.85s]  Not too much more.
[18930.85s -> 18932.29s]  We have demoniccucumber250.
[18932.29s -> 18934.37s]  You should take italics or Kim with you
[18934.37s -> 18935.49s]  for the next green screen stream
[18935.49s -> 18937.17s]  and get some double clips for these streams.
[18937.73s -> 18941.11s]  I was going to bring in a bunch of random stuff,
[18942.66s -> 18945.06s]  but I kind of, I kind of, it's just,
[18945.06s -> 18946.18s]  I think I want just to be me.
[18950.72s -> 18953.44s]  Plus Kim is not, she wouldn't want to do that.
[18960.64s -> 18962.80s]  Ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego.
[18962.80s -> 18963.36s]  There it is again.
[18963.36s -> 18963.84s]  There it is again.
[18963.84s -> 18964.32s]  There it is again.
[18964.32s -> 18964.96s]  There's the ego.
[18965.44s -> 18968.71s]  It's going to be me and my props like Carrot Top.
[18980.07s -> 18981.99s]  You know why I want to do it alone?
[18981.99s -> 18982.87s]  Here's the reason why.
[18984.00s -> 18986.80s]  Because there's something about being in a silent room
[18987.76s -> 18990.00s]  alone with a solo camera and a green screen.
[18991.54s -> 18993.30s]  It's, it's, it's weird.
[18993.30s -> 18994.10s]  I like it though.
[18996.20s -> 18998.60s]  It's oddly calming and interesting.
[18999.24s -> 19001.19s]  And then I have like the chat right there.
[19002.21s -> 19003.41s]  It's really, really interesting.
[19010.90s -> 19012.58s]  I got to get that germa psycho emote
[19012.58s -> 19014.98s]  because I don't even have a germa psycho emote
[19015.62s -> 19018.90s]  and it's used more than half the emotes on stream.
[19026.48s -> 19028.48s]  Thank you large for the 500 bits.
[19029.20s -> 19031.20s]  No message, just five bucks.
[19031.20s -> 19031.52s]  Thank you.
[19034.32s -> 19040.56s]  I want to get the, well, not quite yet.
[19040.56s -> 19042.24s]  Hey iPod, Matt, thanks for the 250.
[19042.24s -> 19044.32s]  Terma, every time someone says peepee poopoo in chat,
[19044.32s -> 19046.64s]  it reminds me of my dog Buster.
[19047.28s -> 19049.28s]  Instead of asking him if he wants to go for a walk,
[19049.28s -> 19051.36s]  I've always said, do you have to go peepee poopoo?
[19060.12s -> 19061.24s]  Everybody talks like that.
[19067.11s -> 19069.35s]  This is a really, really, really, really cute dog.
[19070.07s -> 19072.56s]  We always show dogs on the stream.
[19072.56s -> 19075.46s]  It's, it's, it's required reading.
[19076.10s -> 19093.12s]  Why is it upside down?
[19095.81s -> 19100.93s]  Uh, oh, there we go.
[19100.93s -> 19109.68s]  Look it, dogs are the best.
[19110.40s -> 19115.43s]  Beautiful dog.
[19115.99s -> 19123.43s]  We had those 40 community subs from Shazo.
[19125.00s -> 19129.83s]  Thank you Shazo, again, for your 40 subs.
[19129.83s -> 19130.87s]  That's a shitload.
[19131.51s -> 19137.36s]  We also had, uh, another 1500 bits from large
[19137.36s -> 19138.80s]  who has a message this time.
[19139.36s -> 19143.68s]  Thank you large for your multiple bit drops here.
[19143.68s -> 19145.36s]  Germa, long time fan, but pretty new to the stream.
[19145.92s -> 19148.08s]  Only been able to catch a couple here and there.
[19148.08s -> 19151.12s]  Usually watch Germa's second and the stream archives.
[19151.12s -> 19152.56s]  But I always wanted to send some support
[19152.56s -> 19154.40s]  and tell you how much you've made me laugh over the years.
[19154.40s -> 19156.08s]  Thank you for being my favorite content creator.
[19156.08s -> 19156.40s]  Thank you.
[19157.76s -> 19158.56s]  My pleasure.
[19159.36s -> 19164.10s]  Thank you large.
[19167.94s -> 19169.70s]  Uh, glad to have you on stream this time.
[19170.34s -> 19172.16s]  Thanks for coming and checking it out.
[19172.80s -> 19176.45s]  Thank you.
[19177.09s -> 19184.61s]  Thank you Pigeon for the 250 bits.
[19184.61s -> 19185.73s]  Terma, I don't know if this is intentional,
[19185.73s -> 19187.01s]  but I posted my friend's video
[19187.01s -> 19188.85s]  between the SCP Scary Discord one
[19188.85s -> 19190.37s]  and the Rap You're So Precious one.
[19190.93s -> 19192.37s]  If you did this intentionally, I understand.
[19192.37s -> 19193.33s]  But if not, here it is.
[19194.45s -> 19195.81s]  Um, it's because this is on Twitter.
[19199.96s -> 19202.84s]  Uh, Twitter videos is kind of annoying to show on stream.
[19205.59s -> 19208.63s]  So make sure you follow the rules.
[19208.63s -> 19212.64s]  The rules say YouTube or Imgur.
[19213.60s -> 19215.68s]  YouTube, YouTube, Imgur, Imgur.
[19216.56s -> 19222.45s]  Twitter is really, really annoying
[19222.45s -> 19223.57s]  to actually like screen cap
[19223.57s -> 19226.05s]  because it starts off as this tiny little box
[19226.05s -> 19227.17s]  on the person's page.
[19227.81s -> 19229.01s]  And then if you try to make it bigger,
[19229.01s -> 19230.45s]  it takes up the whole screen.
[19230.45s -> 19235.68s]  The Twitter player is, uh, not so good.
[19236.32s -> 19242.05s]  Yeah, and Twitter autoplay.
[19242.05s -> 19243.09s]  It's just, yeah, yeah.
[19243.81s -> 19245.97s]  Imgur, YouTube, or in Discord
[19245.97s -> 19249.86s]  because 99% of the time,
[19249.86s -> 19250.98s]  I'd say just get it on YouTube.
[19253.38s -> 19255.46s]  It's much easier to cycle through YouTube
[19255.46s -> 19256.74s]  and have like a YouTube list
[19256.74s -> 19258.74s]  than it is to have YouTube, YouTube,
[19258.74s -> 19260.02s]  YouTube, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter,
[19260.02s -> 19261.06s]  YouTube, Twitter, Twitter.
[19261.78s -> 19264.66s]  It just, the format that I have
[19264.66s -> 19265.86s]  when I am tabbing through,
[19266.82s -> 19268.58s]  it's so much easier for me
[19268.58s -> 19270.02s]  just to have them on YouTube and Imgur.
[19272.40s -> 19273.68s]  So that's why.
[19274.24s -> 19277.44s]  And some videos that were uploaded to Twitter
[19277.44s -> 19279.52s]  actually had a second mirror that was YouTube
[19279.52s -> 19280.56s]  and that's the one that I used.
[19291.51s -> 19294.63s]  Thank you Piff Flavor for the 500 bits.
[19295.43s -> 19296.79s]  Germans want to give you money
[19296.79s -> 19300.31s]  and say that now 46.3% of my net income
[19300.31s -> 19301.67s]  is going to you.
[19301.67s -> 19302.79s]  Thanks, you thief.
[19303.75s -> 19308.66s]  Why are you giving me 46% of your income?
[19313.17s -> 19314.61s]  Shave the first number off of that.
[19318.13s -> 19319.57s]  And then I'd still be like,
[19319.57s -> 19321.73s]  well, you're giving me that much of your income.
[19322.61s -> 19328.45s]  He wants 6% of all your income.
[19331.49s -> 19333.73s]  No, I just said even that would be like,
[19333.73s -> 19334.69s]  what the hell's going on?
[19338.37s -> 19341.01s]  It's the 6% Jerma tax.
[19341.01s -> 19344.63s]  Jesus.
[19347.78s -> 19350.18s]  Hey, Jay Bong, thanks for the 250.
[19350.18s -> 19353.86s]  Appreciate it.
[19355.97s -> 19357.81s]  Jerma, you skipped over content I made.
[19360.39s -> 19362.15s]  Also, five or six things were skipped over.
[19362.15s -> 19362.79s]  Get it together.
[19363.59s -> 19364.60s]  Here's the thing.
[19367.04s -> 19369.20s]  When I'm compiling this stuff,
[19370.08s -> 19371.76s]  some things are going to get left through the cracks.
[19377.14s -> 19378.98s]  And whether it's something that I was like,
[19378.98s -> 19380.98s]  I want to show this or maybe I'll put it somewhere else.
[19380.98s -> 19382.02s]  Maybe I'll try this at the end.
[19382.02s -> 19382.98s]  Maybe I'll try this here.
[19387.70s -> 19390.34s]  Not everything that's uploaded to the Discord channel
[19390.34s -> 19391.54s]  is going to be shown on stream.
[19392.26s -> 19393.62s]  It's not as simple as,
[19393.62s -> 19395.78s]  oh, there were 425 images.
[19395.78s -> 19398.90s]  So 425 images are going to be shown on stream.
[19398.90s -> 19405.46s]  I'm kind of just trying to compile them
[19405.46s -> 19408.34s]  and put them in if I have this or too many of these.
[19409.38s -> 19414.34s]  Because remember, I do want these streams
[19414.34s -> 19416.50s]  to still stick in that, you know,
[19416.50s -> 19420.98s]  three to four, five, you know, plus four plus hours.
[19422.45s -> 19424.29s]  So just because it is put in that channel
[19424.29s -> 19426.21s]  does not mean it's going to be shown on stream.
[19426.21s -> 19427.81s]  I actually should probably put that in the rules too.
[19436.63s -> 19437.83s]  Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[19438.39s -> 19441.76s]  Because the same thing for like the emote contest too.
[19441.76s -> 19444.32s]  It's just because somebody put an emote submission in
[19444.32s -> 19445.60s]  doesn't mean that I was going to show it.
[19446.40s -> 19449.72s]  And there's a potential for,
[19449.72s -> 19451.08s]  and this is something I thought
[19451.08s -> 19452.20s]  was probably going to happen with this too,
[19452.20s -> 19453.64s]  is people could get like annoyed
[19454.28s -> 19456.36s]  that their submission did not get put on stream.
[19456.36s -> 19457.88s]  But like I said, you have to realize,
[19460.04s -> 19461.48s]  I can't, it's not just going to be
[19461.48s -> 19463.80s]  every single submission is going to be put in.
[19471.44s -> 19473.04s]  A majority of them will.
[19473.60s -> 19476.34s]  Just not every single one.
[19478.69s -> 19480.13s]  Also time too.
[19480.13s -> 19482.21s]  Because when you see the stream go live
[19482.21s -> 19483.73s]  that has a community content title,
[19485.27s -> 19487.67s]  I'm taking all the submissions
[19487.67s -> 19489.35s]  from that period that I did last
[19489.91s -> 19491.91s]  to the day before the stream started.
[19491.91s -> 19493.35s]  So if you're like, oh, what happened?
[19493.35s -> 19494.31s]  What happened to my submission?
[19494.31s -> 19495.43s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[19495.43s -> 19496.47s]  I put this up today.
[19497.03s -> 19497.83s]  That's why.
[19497.83s -> 19499.51s]  It's because it's like the day before
[19499.51s -> 19501.11s]  so I can start to compile them.
[19501.11s -> 19507.30s]  More tidbits.
[19507.86s -> 19515.83s]  There should be a poll so we can select what he sees.
[19516.39s -> 19518.31s]  No, I'd rather just do it at my own discretion.
[19519.19s -> 19520.39s]  Because then you start, people,
[19521.35s -> 19523.19s]  there could be like community favorites
[19523.19s -> 19524.87s]  and people, stuff that I,
[19524.87s -> 19526.47s]  stuff that wouldn't be considered.
[19526.47s -> 19528.07s]  Wow, that's so good.
[19528.07s -> 19529.19s]  That's so incredible.
[19530.15s -> 19532.63s]  Or like, oh, that was really low effort.
[19532.63s -> 19534.39s]  A lot of the high effort ones would just be picked.
[19535.51s -> 19537.19s]  And then you would also end up
[19537.19s -> 19539.11s]  with a bunch of potential like meme videos
[19539.11s -> 19540.71s]  that would just get through
[19540.71s -> 19543.19s]  because somebody just wrote, oh, stinky.
[19545.04s -> 19545.36s]  Right.
[19545.36s -> 19547.04s]  But in the rules already,
[19547.04s -> 19548.96s]  it does say that it has to be at least,
[19548.96s -> 19550.56s]  it has to be related to the channel.
[19552.60s -> 19555.24s]  Like, oh, stinky makes no sense for me
[19555.24s -> 19556.68s]  to play on a community content night.
[19557.08s -> 19559.40s]  It just doesn't have anything to do with the channel.
[19560.20s -> 19562.23s]  It's just a video.
[19562.95s -> 19564.85s]  It even says, like, it's not like
[19564.85s -> 19566.13s]  I'm not gonna watch Gordon Ramsay
[19566.13s -> 19567.25s]  who says fuck off a hundred times.
[19567.89s -> 19575.00s]  That's community content.
[19575.00s -> 19577.88s]  No, telling me your favorite movie is Star Wars
[19577.88s -> 19581.33s]  is not community content.
[19581.33s -> 19583.41s]  Telling me your favorite video is the gnome video
[19583.41s -> 19589.70s]  is not community content.
[19589.70s -> 19592.82s]  It's like community-oriented content.
[19594.92s -> 19597.72s]  I have never mentioned one time on this stream
[19597.72s -> 19599.32s]  the uh-oh farting monkey.
[19602.20s -> 19605.32s]  The, there's just that it has no context.
[19605.32s -> 19608.84s]  Any game I've played, any stream, any, anything.
[19611.17s -> 19612.77s]  Well, I did, we did today.
[19613.41s -> 19614.93s]  So maybe it'll show up next time.
[19623.43s -> 19625.51s]  So it's only the community if it's about you.
[19628.53s -> 19630.69s]  No, it's just the farting monkey
[19630.69s -> 19633.49s]  has nothing to do with this, anybody in this community.
[19635.06s -> 19636.82s]  What does uh-oh stinky monkey
[19636.82s -> 19637.86s]  have to do with anybody here?
[19639.38s -> 19641.94s]  Other than somebody shared it to you on like Instagram.
[19643.64s -> 19643.88s]  What?
[19648.10s -> 19649.06s]  It's everything.
[19649.06s -> 19650.02s]  It's my life.
[19650.58s -> 19656.56s]  I gotta be careful
[19656.56s -> 19658.00s]  because now people are gonna start putting that
[19658.00s -> 19659.52s]  in their videos that they make.
[19660.08s -> 19669.62s]  It has to be about you and this channel.
[19669.62s -> 19673.22s]  And um, is this, is this like,
[19673.86s -> 19675.30s]  is this like German and the Blowfish
[19675.30s -> 19676.66s]  or is this German 985?
[19676.66s -> 19677.38s]  What's going on here?
[19702.53s -> 19703.57s]  He's a dictator.
[19709.64s -> 19713.88s]  No, long story short, this game content
[19713.88s -> 19715.80s]  that like we've played on this stream,
[19716.76s -> 19719.00s]  marine screen content, fan art.
[19719.00s -> 19722.44s]  Guys, originally, all right, hit the brakes for a second.
[19722.44s -> 19724.92s]  All of you guys that are talking smack to me.
[19725.56s -> 19729.72s]  This was originally gonna be a fan art section of my streams.
[19732.00s -> 19734.48s]  Any farting fucking poopoo smelly monkeys
[19734.48s -> 19735.44s]  in the fan art sections?
[19736.00s -> 19747.36s]  I expanded the fan art to do like green screen stuff
[19747.36s -> 19749.36s]  and like other community oriented videos.
[19754.40s -> 19756.56s]  All right, we're moving on, we're moving on.
[19757.44s -> 19761.20s]  Long story short, by my discretion
[19761.20s -> 19763.76s]  is what I'm gonna be picking to put on stream.
[19763.76s -> 19766.32s]  It has nothing to do with how bad or good content is.
[19768.47s -> 19770.39s]  Art is subjective anyways, that's right.
[19775.11s -> 19777.75s]  The fat germa was the uh-oh monkey, all right.
[19780.05s -> 19781.41s]  But it was a picture of me.
[19782.82s -> 19786.10s]  That's, it wasn't just the picture of the monkey.
[19786.10s -> 19788.34s]  They didn't, they didn't draw the monkey
[19788.34s -> 19789.22s]  and send it to me.
[19789.22s -> 19791.06s]  It'd be like, why is this monkey here?
[19797.06s -> 19799.80s]  All right, cease, cease.
[19800.44s -> 19811.24s]  Uh, thank you Flinzenberg for the thousand bits, appreciate it.
[19811.80s -> 19814.08s]  Germa really enjoyed this stream.
[19814.08s -> 19815.92s]  I just want to let you know that I've been watching your content
[19815.92s -> 19817.20s]  since your old TF2 days
[19817.76s -> 19819.36s]  and you're still the only person I'm subbed to.
[19820.32s -> 19825.44s]  Well, that's, how many of you guys only have like one sub on Twitch?
[19834.32s -> 19834.88s]  Is it me?
[19835.60s -> 19838.45s]  I saw somebody say me that's not subbed to me.
[19839.25s -> 19840.29s]  Who is it then?
[19840.29s -> 19844.13s]  Who are you subbed to that's not me?
[19844.13s -> 19858.15s]  Oh, I know who it is, Vinesauce.
[19859.51s -> 19861.35s]  All right, okay, I'll let that one slide.
[19862.07s -> 19862.47s]  Who else?
[19863.27s -> 19866.88s]  Star, I'll let that one slide too.
[19873.86s -> 19874.58s]  Grillmaster.
[19874.58s -> 19877.92s]  Now that's something I cannot, I cannot stand by.
[19886.15s -> 19889.51s]  You guys want to know like the 5,000 IQ play for me?
[19890.31s -> 19891.59s]  Make a Grillmaster account.
[19892.55s -> 19894.47s]  Have it be under my name and have subs on it.
[19895.33s -> 19897.81s]  So then people will sub to Grillmaster as like,
[19897.81s -> 19899.89s]  oh look, I'm subbing to Grillmaster instead of Germa.
[19899.89s -> 19911.72s]  Gotcha, I own that account.
[19911.72s -> 19916.12s]  Just play off of, hire like an actor to be Grillmaster
[19916.12s -> 19918.84s]  and stream and it's just like an actor that I've hired
[19918.84s -> 19920.52s]  and it just all funnels back to me.
[19921.32s -> 19927.38s]  That's a pretty good Disney strat, yeah.
[19927.94s -> 19934.18s]  So people would be like, oh yeah, fuck you Germa.
[19934.18s -> 19937.30s]  I subbed to Grillmaster and I'll be like, what, what, what?
[19937.94s -> 19938.66s]  Are you serious?
[19938.66s -> 19941.38s]  Get out, get out of here, you Grillmaster asshole.
[19945.04s -> 19951.14s]  And then other people will be like, yeah, let's go sub to Grillmaster.
[19951.14s -> 19953.62s]  Yeah, they'll get really pissed at about that.
[19953.62s -> 19965.67s]  They'll just be like, dude, are you seriously going to do that to me?
[19966.47s -> 19967.88s]  Get out of here.
[19969.96s -> 19971.16s]  Guys, this is bullshit.
[19973.78s -> 19990.23s]  Hey, speaking of people that give their hard earned money
[19990.95s -> 19994.23s]  that is never obligated to this stream all the time.
[19995.43s -> 19999.59s]  That allows me to live this fucking weird wild life.
[20000.39s -> 20001.59s]  Thank you, here they come.
[20002.31s -> 20009.38s]  And it's a shitload of people.
[20009.38s -> 20010.82s]  How many of you accidentally subbed to me
[20010.82s -> 20012.42s]  because you wanted to sub to Grillmaster, I wonder?
[20017.17s -> 20018.45s]  Thanks guys, seriously.
[20023.19s -> 20027.19s]  But thank you, that was Fleisenberg, or Flinzenberg for the thousand bits.
[20029.84s -> 20032.48s]  They said they've been watching for a long time since TF2.
[20032.48s -> 20033.68s]  Only person I'm subbed to.
[20035.27s -> 20037.59s]  And they also say, have you ever considered streaming the Wind Waker?
[20039.96s -> 20044.93s]  Maybe eventually we'll do a GameCube week or something.
[20044.93s -> 20048.21s]  Because there are a lot of good games for the GameCube that I passed up.
[20048.93s -> 20050.45s]  I have to play Mario Sunshine.
[20051.17s -> 20056.68s]  Holy shit, this is some actual legit classics I've never played.
[20056.68s -> 20059.89s]  Pikmin, I have to at least play.
[20060.45s -> 20063.65s]  Is me not playing Mario Sunshine on stream illegal?
[20065.80s -> 20068.04s]  Does hearing that out loud make you guys so angry
[20068.04s -> 20069.64s]  that it's against the law for me not to do it?
[20077.06s -> 20078.10s]  Put it on the list.
[20078.10s -> 20084.16s]  We'll probably do it eventually.
[20086.98s -> 20088.42s]  Hey, gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[20088.42s -> 20089.70s]  Another awesome community night.
[20090.44s -> 20092.04s]  There was so much cool shit the community made
[20092.04s -> 20093.08s]  and I can't wait for the next one.
[20093.08s -> 20096.60s]  I'll probably make more Soul Calibur VI characters for the next one.
[20097.24s -> 20098.04s]  Any requests?
[20099.97s -> 20110.64s]  Dr. Schmikeson, that's number one, for sure.
[20115.03s -> 20117.11s]  This emote, yeah, do the it's me emote.
[20117.11s -> 20117.99s]  That one would be good too.
[20130.20s -> 20132.04s]  We need him on the green screen.
[20132.04s -> 20133.96s]  That, now that's not possible.
[20135.83s -> 20136.63s]  I'm sorry to say.
[20140.85s -> 20143.09s]  Yeah, no, I love the stuff that people come up with.
[20151.83s -> 20156.31s]  You know what, maybe, oh, I will make people very bad.
[20158.45s -> 20162.53s]  What if Bugleberry is on that green screen for like a few minutes?
[20163.25s -> 20169.81s]  I gotta be careful though,
[20169.81s -> 20173.11s]  because I'm guaranteed to lose a thousand viewers or more.
[20173.11s -> 20176.48s]  It's all good, whatever.
[20180.50s -> 20190.02s]  With the reverb, I was, there's nothing I can even do about it now.
[20190.02s -> 20194.40s]  But thinking back on that, I was like, fuck, it's so loud.
[20195.04s -> 20200.32s]  But yeah, definitely Dr. Schmikeson.
[20200.32s -> 20211.83s]  Thank you doorkeeper the 250.
[20211.83s -> 20214.23s]  Did my video get lost or did the mods hate it?
[20214.23s -> 20217.17s]  It's not mods, it's me.
[20218.05s -> 20219.30s]  I didn't hate your video.
[20219.30s -> 20222.02s]  I didn't, but I'm just saying it's me that's making these decisions.
[20222.66s -> 20225.57s]  Based on a couple of internal factors.
[20228.21s -> 20230.21s]  No, that's, you're taking the words out of my mouth
[20230.21s -> 20232.69s]  and you're putting them in order the way that I said them
[20233.41s -> 20234.69s]  and adding hate on them.
[20235.25s -> 20240.92s]  No, like I said, I gotta put that in the rules.
[20241.48s -> 20244.92s]  That a submission does not mean it'll be on stream.
[20244.92s -> 20249.97s]  I think school's bill sucks.
[20249.97s -> 20253.09s]  It has nothing to do with videos being bad or video,
[20253.09s -> 20257.01s]  it's just trying to compile an equal amount of things.
[20257.01s -> 20262.20s]  And no, I'm not, I might hate your video.
[20262.20s -> 20263.32s]  That's not what it is.
[20264.04s -> 20268.34s]  Sometimes length or how long something is
[20268.42s -> 20271.78s]  or the content of the video, it could be anything.
[20281.96s -> 20282.92s]  Have you seen them all?
[20284.20s -> 20287.08s]  No, I don't watch the videos.
[20287.08s -> 20288.44s]  What I do is I open them.
[20290.04s -> 20291.72s]  I click, click, click.
[20291.72s -> 20292.52s]  Okay, hold on.
[20292.52s -> 20293.40s]  Let me see right there.
[20295.03s -> 20296.87s]  See the length, see the subject matter.
[20300.50s -> 20301.30s]  I go, what is this?
[20304.10s -> 20305.38s]  You judge the book by its cover.
[20305.38s -> 20309.59s]  Yeah, that's not how you guys read books.
[20309.59s -> 20310.71s]  I've read all the Lord of the Rings.
[20310.71s -> 20313.67s]  All I had to do is read the first fucking one page
[20313.67s -> 20314.47s]  on the back and the front.
[20324.88s -> 20327.92s]  Also something that I, okay, I'm gonna have to update the rules
[20328.48s -> 20333.36s]  because something that it's like, it's so subjective
[20335.38s -> 20338.77s]  that I have to update the rules
[20339.57s -> 20343.17s]  because a lot of submissions would come in
[20343.17s -> 20345.49s]  that would just like clips of the stream
[20348.34s -> 20350.34s]  or like clips of other people's streams.
[20350.98s -> 20358.87s]  Have mods filter?
[20368.87s -> 20371.11s]  I mean, they kind of already do in a way.
[20371.11s -> 20385.11s]  He's changing the rules for his benefit.
[20385.75s -> 20388.23s]  Well, also that's a lot of work too.
[20389.27s -> 20392.71s]  Hey, Marge compiled like fucking 400 videos for me
[20392.71s -> 20394.55s]  and like 200 pieces of artwork
[20394.55s -> 20395.59s]  and because they can't
[20396.47s -> 20398.07s]  because I have to show it on stream.
[20398.63s -> 20402.39s]  So they would have to make new playlists every month
[20402.39s -> 20406.15s]  and they'd have to give me like an Imgur file,
[20406.15s -> 20408.87s]  an Imgur album with hundreds of photos in it and stuff.
[20408.87s -> 20410.47s]  That's too much to ask somebody.
[20411.68s -> 20412.72s]  That's for me to do.
[20413.44s -> 20420.47s]  And they help a shitload for a lot of stuff
[20420.47s -> 20421.27s]  that you guys don't even know.
[20421.91s -> 20432.32s]  Dorky says, I understand and not everything be watched
[20432.32s -> 20434.24s]  but if I submit a video and you don't watch it
[20434.24s -> 20436.96s]  and I ask you why there's a variety of factors.
[20439.94s -> 20440.98s]  I'm just gonna update the rules
[20443.30s -> 20445.06s]  because right now it's,
[20446.24s -> 20448.40s]  I have it for under 10 minutes for videos
[20449.20s -> 20451.46s]  but it realistically should probably be under five.
[20452.18s -> 20454.77s]  And I think that was probably what the,
[20455.41s -> 20457.57s]  I think the video you uploaded was like five and a half minutes,
[20457.57s -> 20458.61s]  six minutes or something, right?
[20460.74s -> 20461.70s]  That's probably what it was.
[20462.50s -> 20467.60s]  Unless for like there,
[20467.60s -> 20470.64s]  because let me try to think of like some scenarios
[20470.64s -> 20474.32s]  where more than five minutes for like a community video would be.
[20475.44s -> 20486.63s]  Maybe in some cases, no music videos,
[20486.63s -> 20487.75s]  no full music videos.
[20488.39s -> 20491.83s]  Maybe to, this is so early, you have to remember.
[20491.83s -> 20494.63s]  Like this is the second one that I've done.
[20494.63s -> 20496.95s]  So I'm still trying to figure out exactly how these are gonna play out.
[20496.95s -> 20504.39s]  But like full songs, videos like over five minutes maybe,
[20504.39s -> 20505.67s]  I'm trying to think of what would work
[20506.31s -> 20516.18s]  because the bottles getting nuked on some of them.
[20516.18s -> 20521.73s]  Yeah, the music based ones are really good.
[20521.73s -> 20522.61s]  Yeah, that's right.
[20522.61s -> 20527.33s]  I mean, it's, I don't know, it's a learning process.
[20528.05s -> 20536.60s]  Just do an empty playlist.
[20546.82s -> 20549.54s]  Do all the music videos last so they get muted together.
[20551.01s -> 20552.13s]  That's a possibility too.
[20552.77s -> 20556.42s]  Are the ones being bypassed considered for next time?
[20557.97s -> 20559.17s]  For the most part, no.
[20559.17s -> 20561.57s]  But there are a few of them that I didn't show
[20561.57s -> 20563.17s]  that will probably just be on the next one.
[20563.73s -> 20565.33s]  I think door cubes yours in particular.
[20566.44s -> 20569.40s]  Because I'm still trying to figure out like length of videos.
[20577.80s -> 20581.08s]  And that was not on the rules at all over the last month or two.
[20581.08s -> 20588.66s]  So just write solid rules.
[20588.66s -> 20590.26s]  Well, there are rules there, but here's the thing.
[20591.46s -> 20592.90s]  No one will ever be happy.
[20592.90s -> 20593.70s]  That's just a fact.
[20594.56s -> 20596.40s]  Because if I make a rule that somebody doesn't like,
[20596.40s -> 20598.16s]  they'll be pissed off about it.
[20598.80s -> 20600.40s]  Don't have videos longer than five minutes.
[20600.40s -> 20602.13s]  Well, why not?
[20602.13s -> 20608.85s]  Don't have videos that are a majority of just clips from the stream
[20608.85s -> 20609.73s]  that we already have seen.
[20611.22s -> 20611.70s]  Why not?
[20612.26s -> 20619.54s]  Here come the protesters.
[20622.23s -> 20623.91s]  Ban Jojo videos.
[20623.91s -> 20625.27s]  Well, what if I didn't do that?
[20625.27s -> 20625.91s]  What if I do that?
[20625.91s -> 20626.71s]  What if I didn't do that?
[20627.27s -> 20633.28s]  Ban Jojo videos and dumb clips.
[20634.34s -> 20635.14s]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[20635.14s -> 20636.90s]  Somebody's already writing that.
[20636.90s -> 20638.42s]  Somebody is already writing that.
[20655.28s -> 20656.48s]  Ban my content.
[20659.78s -> 20661.54s]  What I'll end up doing is I'm going to go through
[20661.54s -> 20665.80s]  and put in some more like hard rules.
[20665.80s -> 20668.04s]  Because there are only a couple of real hard rules there right now.
[20668.04s -> 20669.56s]  Remember, this is the second time we've done this.
[20670.28s -> 20674.53s]  This is community content night two, not like 30.
[20676.50s -> 20679.14s]  Trying to figure it out as we go.
[20679.86s -> 20690.31s]  Flaccid rules.
[20697.11s -> 20699.03s]  If your submission got bypassed,
[20699.67s -> 20702.23s]  wait for the new rules to show up, which I will do them.
[20702.23s -> 20704.71s]  I'll do them later on tonight and probably tomorrow.
[20705.75s -> 20706.07s]  We'll see.
[20706.07s -> 20707.19s]  They'll be there in the next day or two.
[20708.64s -> 20710.88s]  Check through the solid hard rules that I'm going to write.
[20712.08s -> 20712.96s]  And then bingo.
[20713.60s -> 20716.95s]  Put it in.
[20724.34s -> 20725.54s]  Nice hard rules.
[20731.72s -> 20734.12s]  But to be fair though, there really were only, I think,
[20734.76s -> 20736.04s]  a handful of omissions.
[20737.32s -> 20738.84s]  Some of them may not have even been intentional.
[20739.40s -> 20745.27s]  You know, of the hundreds of submissions, almost all of them got in.
[20745.27s -> 20755.24s]  And unfortunately, when you're doing a new thing,
[20755.24s -> 20756.92s]  sometimes something falls through the cracks and
[20757.56s -> 20758.68s]  somebody's like, what the fuck happened?
[20758.68s -> 20759.80s]  And it's like, let's figure it out.
[20760.60s -> 20764.37s]  And that's what we're doing.
[20765.01s -> 20778.39s]  You need a German 985 quality assurance team.
[20779.75s -> 20783.54s]  Yeah, but then it's the mod's fault, right?
[20784.79s -> 20788.31s]  If I give a set of rules to the mods and then the mods go through
[20788.31s -> 20791.43s]  and they omit things that are not of the rules,
[20792.31s -> 20793.75s]  then everybody hates the mods.
[20793.75s -> 20796.07s]  And then it's just the cycle continues to repeat itself.
[20811.43s -> 20813.44s]  But to end this conversation,
[20815.22s -> 20818.58s]  if something you submitted was not shown,
[20820.00s -> 20825.36s]  check that Discord, the pinned message in the Discord channel.
[20825.36s -> 20829.20s]  I'm going to give like a bang, bang, bang, bang, bang rules.
[20830.72s -> 20832.56s]  Check your submission, do it again.
[20832.56s -> 20840.18s]  But also remember that omissions are probably still going to happen
[20840.18s -> 20845.06s]  just because of time and amount of submissions.
[20845.06s -> 20847.54s]  And it's not guaranteed.
[20847.54s -> 20850.26s]  Your video can't ever be guaranteed to be on stream
[20850.90s -> 20855.12s]  because what if it gets removed from YouTube?
[20855.12s -> 20855.92s]  That's not my fault.
[20855.92s -> 20858.80s]  I can't be like, it's guaranteed if you submit it with this.
[20858.80s -> 20860.80s]  It's going to be on the stream.
[20861.44s -> 20864.08s]  There are things out of my control that might happen
[20865.54s -> 20866.98s]  that I can't guarantee.
[20867.70s -> 20872.84s]  Like if your video gets like removed from YouTube or something,
[20872.84s -> 20874.68s]  or like your channel gets like striked,
[20875.48s -> 20877.08s]  I can't, there's nothing I can do about that.
[20877.64s -> 20892.55s]  Talk to YouTube and use some of your clout.
[20893.57s -> 20895.65s]  If you think under a hundred million years
[20895.65s -> 20898.53s]  that YouTube even has employees that work on a day-to-day basis
[20898.53s -> 20900.13s]  that listen to fucking content creators,
[20900.85s -> 20905.52s]  there are people with like 50 times more subscribers than I do
[20905.52s -> 20908.32s]  that get like the default support letter back.
[20909.04s -> 20911.62s]  That ain't going to happen.
[20923.06s -> 20929.09s]  But we got two, three more bits to do and we can go to bed
[20929.09s -> 20930.13s]  and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[20946.82s -> 20947.22s]  Thank you.
[20947.22s -> 20948.58s]  Spooky Spitfire for the 250.
[20948.58s -> 20949.78s]  So Jerm, there are a couple things I have to say.
[20949.78s -> 20952.18s]  First, thanks for you for resisting the uh-oh vid.
[20952.82s -> 20955.30s]  Aside from meme value, it's the bottom of the barrel.
[20956.18s -> 20959.12s]  Second, I honestly haven't even touched Sekiro
[20959.12s -> 20960.56s]  since the last time I donated.
[20961.36s -> 20965.40s]  I don't know, something about Sekiro just turns me off.
[20965.48s -> 20968.20s]  Also, new ranting, new rating.
[20969.00s -> 20976.64s]  Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 2, SD2, Sekiro.
[20977.54s -> 20977.94s]  Really?
[20982.53s -> 20983.89s]  Dark Souls 2 over Sekiro?
[20988.21s -> 20989.73s]  They're both pretty polarizing, I can see that.
[21001.17s -> 21003.01s]  Dark Souls 2 is better than Dark Souls 3.
[21003.01s -> 21004.29s]  I'm not sure, sir, I agree with that.
[21008.53s -> 21009.97s]  Third, what video is this?
[21011.56s -> 21014.42s]  It's an old video I did in like high school.
[21014.42s -> 21016.90s]  With friends of mine, we've gone over it before.
[21020.02s -> 21023.22s]  We have touched on this video like three or four times now.
[21023.86s -> 21025.22s]  Over the course of the last year or two.
[21025.94s -> 21028.85s]  Pretty weird video, yes.
[21029.49s -> 21044.04s]  Basically, there's new terms of service they can make a terminated channel
[21044.04s -> 21045.40s]  that isn't providing them income.
[21045.96s -> 21048.84s]  Their wording is vague enough that it can be interpreted as against
[21048.84s -> 21051.24s]  actually shitty videos or small creators.
[21051.24s -> 21051.80s]  Wait, what?
[21052.68s -> 21053.40s]  Is that for real?
[21053.96s -> 21058.68s]  What the hell is going on over there?
[21068.37s -> 21070.61s]  Jerma Ass Stinky Feet.
[21070.61s -> 21071.81s]  You changed your name, thanks.
[21072.61s -> 21075.54s]  You changed it to instead of has, okay.
[21076.42s -> 21077.86s]  Thanks for the 250.
[21077.86s -> 21082.12s]  Hey, Jerma, a while ago you said if I didn't donate 46% of my net income to you,
[21082.12s -> 21083.80s]  you wouldn't be able to afford dog food.
[21087.81s -> 21089.09s]  Is this the same person?
[21089.09s -> 21090.53s]  I feel like these are the same people.
[21091.49s -> 21093.41s]  With two or three different Grillmaster accounts.
[21093.41s -> 21094.29s]  Is that what's going on?
[21095.01s -> 21102.55s]  What's with this 46.3% income thing?
[21116.74s -> 21118.02s]  You are a hive mind, that's right.
[21118.82s -> 21121.06s]  Chunky Baloney, thanks for the $5.75.
[21122.02s -> 21124.66s]  I know you love this monkey, stinky monkey thing,
[21124.66s -> 21126.02s]  but please stop talking about it.
[21126.02s -> 21127.54s]  The Jerma brand is better than this.
[21129.27s -> 21129.99s]  God damn it.
[21130.95s -> 21134.10s]  Thank you, Jay Bong for the 250.
[21134.10s -> 21135.38s]  Yeah, for the next green screen night,
[21135.38s -> 21137.78s]  please get some better lighting and camera quality.
[21138.50s -> 21140.58s]  Well, the lights are just the studio lights.
[21140.58s -> 21141.70s]  I can't really move those,
[21142.98s -> 21145.70s]  but the camera will be better this time.
[21154.28s -> 21154.92s]  That's for sure.
[21163.67s -> 21165.51s]  And then DoorCube, thanks for the 250.
[21166.23s -> 21168.40s]  This is touching upon the rules again.
[21168.40s -> 21170.16s]  I will make the rules very, very clear.
[21171.73s -> 21175.17s]  I have in my mind what I want them to be.
[21175.89s -> 21178.61s]  It might take me a day or two to get them up there in the pin message.
[21179.33s -> 21180.69s]  But just check it out again.
[21182.85s -> 21184.61s]  Your video was the carnival thing, right?
[21184.61s -> 21189.08s]  Carnival and like italics, like talking about me and stuff, right?
[21189.08s -> 21190.28s]  I'm remembering this correctly, right?
[21196.53s -> 21197.25s]  Yeah, yeah, okay.
[21201.70s -> 21204.42s]  Yeah, that one probably should have been shown.
[21204.42s -> 21205.86s]  I must have omitted it.
[21205.86s -> 21206.74s]  I think it was the length,
[21206.74s -> 21208.58s]  but then it was like a 10 minutes was the length and
[21209.86s -> 21211.14s]  that'll be shown next time.
[21211.14s -> 21213.14s]  I actually remember that one specifically
[21213.70s -> 21215.86s]  and like clicking it and having it on a tab.
[21219.46s -> 21220.58s]  So it's my bad.
[21229.03s -> 21229.91s]  Shave my eyebrows.
[21229.91s -> 21231.19s]  Why would I shave my eyebrows?
[21241.24s -> 21242.92s]  No, no, the rules need to be hard.
[21242.92s -> 21243.40s]  They do.
[21243.40s -> 21246.84s]  I just like I, like I said, I had this thing in my brain where it's like
[21246.84s -> 21254.44s]  if you give hard rules for stuff about like what is like art and content,
[21254.44s -> 21257.65s]  it's like you start to run that line of
[21258.37s -> 21263.11s]  how can you even determine what's like should be allowed and what shouldn't be
[21263.11s -> 21265.03s]  when it's just like community meme nights.
[21266.60s -> 21267.64s]  It's a hard thing to do.
[21270.02s -> 21272.18s]  Like know this, know that, know this, do this.
[21272.18s -> 21272.90s]  Keep it under here.
[21272.90s -> 21273.46s]  Keep it over here.
[21273.46s -> 21292.53s]  It's hard to juggle it, but I'm going to put some legit rules again.
[21293.33s -> 21294.13s]  Third time's a charm.
[21294.13s -> 21295.97s]  We'll see if we get it right by number three.
[21295.97s -> 21297.25s]  And that's not to say anything was wrong.
[21298.13s -> 21299.57s]  This is fantastic.
[21300.69s -> 21302.77s]  These streams, the last two of these have been fucking amazing,
[21304.50s -> 21306.82s]  but including the people that should be included
[21307.72s -> 21309.56s]  is obviously a big part of it too.
[21309.56s -> 21312.12s]  So I'll get it right.
[21313.08s -> 21313.72s]  I'll get it right.
[21320.58s -> 21323.33s]  Anyways, we are at almost the end.
[21325.70s -> 21326.42s]  Lazy Luke.
[21326.98s -> 21328.02s]  Thanks for the 250.
[21328.02s -> 21329.62s]  Jerma, I made you this Jupiter page.
[21329.62s -> 21332.82s]  If someone does a jupin chat, you can click it to save the earth.
[21333.38s -> 21334.02s]  Wait, what?
[21334.98s -> 21338.77s]  You can click it to save the earth.
[21351.36s -> 21352.16s]  No one's done one.
[21352.88s -> 21354.96s]  Click on Jupiter to save earth.
[21355.60s -> 21358.45s]  Oh, I want to get this on stream.
[21358.45s -> 21359.17s]  This is really cool.
[21364.74s -> 21365.78s]  This is cool.
[21366.42s -> 21376.53s]  Is this going to work?
[21381.27s -> 21381.99s]  I think so.
[21383.51s -> 21388.18s]  Take a look at this.
[21388.90s -> 21390.71s]  There's some Jupiters.
[21390.71s -> 21391.19s]  Let's see them.
[21396.16s -> 21397.20s]  It actually works.
[21401.09s -> 21402.29s]  Can I click the mes?
[21411.33s -> 21412.37s]  Come on, flood it.
[21412.37s -> 21413.09s]  Let's see it.
[21413.09s -> 21424.04s]  I want to see more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[21424.04s -> 21424.76s]  Only two?
[21424.76s -> 21425.64s]  Only four?
[21425.64s -> 21426.84s]  You can do better than this.
[21426.84s -> 21435.54s]  All right, I'm going to let them come up for a little bit.
[21435.54s -> 21436.02s]  Oh, shit.
[21436.02s -> 21436.98s]  Here we go.
[21436.98s -> 21440.48s]  That's because of slow mode.
[21440.48s -> 21449.91s]  Go for it.
[21454.98s -> 21455.94s]  There we go.
[21455.94s -> 21456.66s]  Here they come.
[21460.40s -> 21461.44s]  Save earth quick.
[21462.00s -> 21469.81s]  This is so stupid.
[21469.81s -> 21470.29s]  I love it.
[21471.09s -> 21472.05s]  Oh, shit.
[21472.05s -> 21474.13s]  You guys are kind of hammering down right now.
[21476.20s -> 21477.56s]  Nothing's touched earth though.
[21477.56s -> 21479.48s]  I protected earth flawlessly.
[21486.77s -> 21487.25s]  All right.
[21487.25s -> 21487.81s]  All right.
[21487.81s -> 21488.53s]  Let's kill this.
[21493.22s -> 21494.90s]  That's really, really cool though, Lazy Luke.
[21495.54s -> 21498.18s]  Another addition to the JermaBorg website.
[21499.14s -> 21499.86s]  That's good stuff.
[21500.58s -> 21503.84s]  That's really neat.
[21503.84s -> 21504.08s]  All right.
[21504.08s -> 21508.24s]  I got to put slow mode back to, I don't know, 10 seconds?
[21508.24s -> 21508.80s]  What was it?
[21508.80s -> 21509.36s]  What was it at?
[21509.36s -> 21509.92s]  Five seconds?
[21510.56s -> 21511.57s]  I have no idea.
[21516.58s -> 21520.52s]  But thank you to Cold Warhol.
[21520.52s -> 21521.40s]  Thanks for the thousand bits.
[21521.40s -> 21522.84s]  They say thank you so much for showing my art.
[21522.84s -> 21523.72s]  I'm glad you liked it.
[21524.44s -> 21526.84s]  Here's 10 bucks for not playing the stinky video.
[21527.48s -> 21530.26s]  I'll take it.
[21530.26s -> 21530.82s]  Thank you.
[21530.82s -> 21535.41s]  And yes, by all means, all the artwork was fucking awesome.
[21536.13s -> 21549.01s]  Grill Master is now hosting you.
[21549.89s -> 21551.76s]  Well, that's not even the right name.
[21551.76s -> 21553.75s]  So nice try though.
[21554.39s -> 21556.88s]  It's Grill Meister.
[21557.60s -> 21564.52s]  Frodiun Weapon, thanks for the thousand bits, Frodiun.
[21566.07s -> 21567.75s]  Love and appreciate the streams as always, man.
[21567.75s -> 21568.87s]  It was pretty low energy this month,
[21568.87s -> 21571.51s]  so I missed out on this month's community content night.
[21571.51s -> 21574.23s]  But I will try my best to submit some art for next time.
[21574.71s -> 21576.87s]  Can't compare to some of this amazing talent on here though,
[21576.87s -> 21578.31s]  but I won't let it deter me.
[21579.27s -> 21579.99s]  Don't be deterred.
[21587.68s -> 21591.28s]  Everything that was shown today had its own value.
[21591.28s -> 21594.00s]  That goes for videos and for art.
[21594.72s -> 21599.54s]  I just gotta work out the kinks and the rules.
[21600.18s -> 21603.35s]  But thank you.
[21603.91s -> 21607.09s]  Hope to see a submission from you soon.
[21607.73s -> 21614.90s]  Hey, Jerma has stinky feet, thanks for the 250.
[21615.54s -> 21618.24s]  I already got this one.
[21618.24s -> 21620.56s]  I don't know, because it's the 46% thing again, right?
[21627.65s -> 21629.49s]  Large, thanks for the 500 bits, large.
[21630.29s -> 21631.09s]  They say do it.
[21631.65s -> 21632.53s]  Scream, do it.
[21632.53s -> 21633.01s]  Why would I?
[21633.01s -> 21633.89s]  I'm not gonna scream.
[21636.00s -> 21636.64s]  Scream.
[21643.99s -> 21645.75s]  Verdebril Giant, thanks for the 250.
[21645.75s -> 21647.35s]  Just wanna show you Lazy Luke's game.
[21647.35s -> 21648.71s]  Thanks for the gut-busting stream.
[21649.75s -> 21650.47s]  It was a lot of fun.
[21651.56s -> 21653.56s]  I love this shit more than anything, so.
[21654.44s -> 21659.84s]  Getting to sit back and just watch the crazy shit that you guys do.
[21669.59s -> 21670.87s]  Get lurked on, what?
[21671.51s -> 21674.42s]  Well, I'm clicking the link.
[21680.79s -> 21682.23s]  I did actually see this already,
[21682.23s -> 21683.51s]  because this was submitted today.
[21686.08s -> 21687.60s]  I gotta put that in the rules, too.
[21687.60s -> 21688.96s]  Gotta put that in the rules, too.
[21694.74s -> 21698.42s]  The day before the stream, I got all the rules already upstairs.
[21699.44s -> 21702.50s]  In my mind.
[21702.50s -> 21704.98s]  I did say this is fucking awesome, and it's hilarious.
[21707.78s -> 21711.62s]  But I have to add to the rules that any submission that happens
[21711.62s -> 21715.54s]  at like 12 a.m., the day of that stream,
[21716.42s -> 21718.50s]  it's gonna be the next time.
[21724.04s -> 21727.83s]  But, I mean, you're a goddamn founder, so.
[21729.12s -> 21730.32s]  There's only fucking 20 of you.
[21741.89s -> 21743.01s]  Wait, did that work?
[21745.09s -> 21746.05s]  It did not work.
[21746.05s -> 21746.55s]  Why?
[21747.09s -> 21749.46s]  Oh, yes, it did.
[21754.20s -> 21755.96s]  I mean, you're a damn founder, so.
[21762.23s -> 21764.40s]  Do I have a big forehead?
[21770.10s -> 21770.60s]  Oops.
[21771.14s -> 21771.78s]  Wait, go back.
[21771.78s -> 21772.34s]  Go back there.
[21772.34s -> 21773.14s]  Go back, go back, go back.
[21773.14s -> 21773.70s]  Back, back, back.
[21773.70s -> 21774.74s]  Sorry for bumping you twice.
[21777.09s -> 21778.37s]  I do have a big forehead?
[21778.37s -> 21779.81s]  It's glue, man.
[21779.81s -> 21781.97s]  No, I guess I do have kind of a bumpy head.
[21785.99s -> 21786.79s]  It's awesome, though.
[21787.59s -> 21788.95s]  And we're gonna show it again next time.
[21791.06s -> 21791.56s]  Thank you.
[21792.18s -> 21794.90s]  And I'll see you guys tomorrow for, I don't know, Dead Rising.
[21794.90s -> 21796.90s]  I don't know, maybe Outer Worlds.
[21796.90s -> 21798.34s]  I don't know, maybe Katamari.
[21798.34s -> 21799.78s]  I don't know, maybe a PlayStation game.
[21799.78s -> 21801.14s]  I who fucking has any idea?
[21802.02s -> 21815.16s]  Could be anything.
[21815.16s -> 21816.68s]  Bath Bomb Boy, thanks for the 250.
[21816.68s -> 21818.60s]  You gotta make some of this art and merch.
[21818.60s -> 21819.80s]  They're such good designs.
[21819.80s -> 21820.30s]  They are.
[21821.72s -> 21823.32s]  But that's another thing that I want to get right.
[21824.71s -> 21825.83s]  It's really easy just to be like,
[21825.83s -> 21828.87s]  yeah, we'll do art on some of those.
[21828.87s -> 21829.83s]  And I'm gonna sell them.
[21830.71s -> 21833.06s]  But once money becomes involved,
[21834.32s -> 21836.00s]  it's, you gotta do that shit right.
[21836.72s -> 21841.89s]  You don't want anyone to be unhappy
[21841.89s -> 21844.05s]  or get taken advantage of,
[21844.05s -> 21846.53s]  or it's gotta be done correct.
[21847.49s -> 21856.00s]  Double music.
[21856.56s -> 21858.61s]  Zipper rule.
[21858.61s -> 21859.33s]  Oh, right, right.
[21859.33s -> 21860.21s]  Yeah, sorry about that.
[21863.12s -> 21864.48s]  And again, I do want to say,
[21864.48s -> 21866.64s]  if your submission didn't get through, I'm sorry.
[21867.52s -> 21871.76s]  It's hard for me to guarantee submissions.
[21873.11s -> 21874.55s]  But with solid rules,
[21874.55s -> 21876.79s]  I think that that won't have to be up to, like,
[21876.79s -> 21880.55s]  my discretion for the moment that I happen to look at it
[21880.55s -> 21881.11s]  and see what it is.
[21885.81s -> 21888.56s]  So hold me to that.
[21888.56s -> 21890.48s]  In a couple of days, look at that pin channel.
[21890.48s -> 21894.72s]  There'll be actual real, like, one through eight set of rules.
[21904.00s -> 21904.48s]  Sound good?
[21905.72s -> 21906.20s]  Sound good.
[21907.00s -> 21908.88s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[21914.52s -> 21916.20s]  Hold on, but to be fair,
[21917.00s -> 21919.56s]  to be fair, for the most part,
[21919.56s -> 21923.64s]  I was referring to the uh-oh stinky monkey
[21924.74s -> 21927.46s]  being, like, not eligible for a submission.
[21930.47s -> 21932.79s]  That was where that conversation started.
[21937.83s -> 21939.46s]  All right.
[21939.46s -> 21940.18s]  Good night.
[21940.18s -> 21941.22s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[21945.12s -> 21945.68s]  Take care, guys.
[21948.44s -> 21949.88s]  Wet Warrior, thanks for the 300 bits.
[21949.88s -> 21951.24s]  They say do me a favor to have a good one.
[21951.24s -> 21951.64s]  You too.
[21952.36s -> 21953.32s]  Right at the end.
[21953.32s -> 21984.48s]  See you soon.
