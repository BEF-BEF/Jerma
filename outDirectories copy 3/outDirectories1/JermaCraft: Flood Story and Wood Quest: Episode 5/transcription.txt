[1.85s -> 8.28s]  Okay, so we're out here on the house, and I want to make sure I'm gonna try and do this.
[8.28s -> 16.74s]  I want to make a little little leeway room so when I dig out of my house I don't flood the basement
[16.74s -> 22.14s]  because that really does suck. It's kind of annoying because I'll dig out and all the
[22.14s -> 27.69s]  sudden water will just rush into my basement. Actually is that even technically a basement?
[27.69s -> 35.48s]  This is kind of my entire house. Oh well, whatever, patch you back up. So I want to make sure that I
[35.48s -> 43.35s]  can build outwards rather than have to keep on freaking out every time I build out of my wall.
[43.35s -> 49.94s]  And what the hell? Okay, yeah, here we go. Started to do it a little bit. Let's take it more. One,
[49.94s -> 59.59s]  two, three. See there's my wall right there so now this will not happen. And actually I've got a story
[59.59s -> 65.19s]  for you. I didn't even think about this but I have a story for you right now. It's a story.
[65.19s -> 75.59s]  Let me block off this stupid cascading wave of death. Okay, there we go. Come on. Come on now.
[75.59s -> 82.49s]  Perfect. Okay, now I can start to build outwards. So here's a story for you while I finish this up.
[82.49s -> 86.31s]  As a lot of you guys know, it has to do with flooding and it's actually kind of scary.
[87.11s -> 92.87s]  Scary time for me and my family. Not so scary for you because you are not part of my family,
[92.87s -> 99.66s]  or maybe you are. Maybe you are watching this and you are part of my family. But where am I
[99.66s -> 106.44s]  going with this? So I live in the northeast and a lot of you guys know that the northeast is
[106.44s -> 112.76s]  kind of a weird place when it comes to weather. We get the craziest, hottest summers. We get insanely
[112.76s -> 118.28s]  terrible winters. Like oh what is it like 25 inches of snow? Oh that's great. We get stuff
[118.28s -> 122.76s]  like that. We get heavy rains. We get pretty much every season the worst you could possibly get
[122.76s -> 131.37s]  that season. So talking about the rainfall while I'm just dropping sand into nowhere.
[131.37s -> 139.82s]  Talking about the rainfall while I extend this out. Oh let me try that again. Talking about the
[139.82s -> 147.19s]  rainfall while I extend this out. Essentially we had at one point, it was in April. I remember
[147.19s -> 152.15s]  it was April because April was the only thing I remembered because my brain only likes to remember
[152.15s -> 160.01s]  tragic horrible things and not nice things. So it was April I think of 2009 I think. Maybe
[160.49s -> 170.17s]  no it was 2009 I think. Don't quote me on that. So April 2009 we had crazy crazy rainfall. We had
[170.17s -> 175.53s]  rain that was I think we got like 10 inches of rain in like three days or two days or something
[175.53s -> 182.07s]  like that. Something insane. And our foundation of our houses around here at least in the northeast
[182.07s -> 189.99s]  is not really, can't really handle that. So my basement and my basement of my house is living
[189.99s -> 196.66s]  space. So my basement of my house got flooded. And when I say flooded I don't mean there was just
[196.66s -> 201.32s]  like you know there's like go up slopping around in like two inches of water. No no no no no like
[201.32s -> 208.62s]  the entire second level of my house on the bottom was like shin deep in water. Almost waist almost
[208.62s -> 214.55s]  coming up to like your knees in water. And that was one of the worst experiences of my entire life.
[214.55s -> 219.50s]  If I can safely tell you that that was that was probably one of the worst things that's ever
[219.50s -> 226.47s]  happened to me and my family. It was horrible. Every single room that was down here it was just
[226.47s -> 234.66s]  you were wading through water. Just like floating cats dogs like we had a big bunch of animals here
[234.66s -> 244.04s]  too. We have a ton of animals. It just was really really bad news. And it happened twice. We had one
[244.04s -> 249.64s]  flood. One big bad one. And we had to do a ton of cleanup. We had to get a professional team.
[249.72s -> 255.32s]  It was insane. We had to throw away thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff.
[255.32s -> 261.90s]  And then like two weeks later it happened again. And it was just it was almost like you wanted to
[261.90s -> 267.34s]  friggin blow your brains out. You were just like what is happening to our house? It was one of the
[267.34s -> 273.59s]  worst things ever. And it happened twice within the same two weeks. Oh like even thinking about
[273.59s -> 281.69s]  it makes me want to puke. But anyways let's uh while I patch up this little hole here I want to
[281.69s -> 287.61s]  try and do a like I was telling you a castle. So I want multiple rooms with a dining table for
[287.61s -> 293.46s]  me to eat with my kingsmanship. I'm not sure that even makes any sense. But I want it because I want
[293.46s -> 304.44s]  it. Let's make a boat. I want to be able to get out of this house fairly easily. Here we go. Let's
[304.44s -> 312.79s]  go over here. I like this way. Let's put the boat down. My personal little boat. Okay how do I get
[312.79s -> 321.62s]  in the boat? No no no get back here. No come here. Oh you. Oh how do I get in the boat?
[321.62s -> 324.82s]  Do I click on it? Oh I did it. Okay it's right click.
[333.50s -> 339.82s]  We are taking an adventure through the open world. Going to go to this tree I forgot to cut down.
[340.38s -> 346.38s]  And then I'm going to say hello to this tree. Hello tree and then I'm going to get out of the
[346.38s -> 355.08s]  boat. Out of the boat. How do I get out of the boat? How do I get out of the boat? Okay stay stay.
[355.08s -> 359.69s]  If you saw episode one this is the tree that I didn't cut all the way down.
[360.95s -> 368.79s]  It's the only damn tree with it. What the hell? This cow is dead. I will dig to you.
[373.42s -> 380.86s]  Oh my god. I actually killed him. I feel bad. All right now let's let's actually cut this tree down.
[381.82s -> 388.66s]  Oh delicious. This is gross. Okay I should probably stop doing that or I'm gonna die.
[389.22s -> 399.78s]  Come here wood. All right. The reason I'm doing this is because I want wooden floors. I want
[399.78s -> 405.14s]  wooden paneling on the ground. Because I got a comment somebody saying Jerma make some wooden
[405.14s -> 411.93s]  floors. What are you a caveman? And I responded with I guess I am a caveman. You're right. I need
[411.93s -> 417.27s]  to really think about what I'm doing with myself. So let's cut down this whole tree. Make sure I get
[417.27s -> 423.19s]  the whole damn thing. Nothing else right? No there's just one more here. I gotta use my torch.
[424.92s -> 428.04s]  Okay that should be it. Now will this tree disappear so I can put a new one here?
[429.19s -> 435.74s]  I gotta find new trees. This is bad. No there's more. What? This is like embedded into the mountain.
[437.53s -> 440.25s]  Is this tree in the mountain? Like embedded in the mountain?
[441.42s -> 444.46s]  If I see like another wooden plank right here I'm gonna lose my mind.
[445.10s -> 451.93s]  Hold on I want to I need to check this out. Because the tree is still here.
[451.93s -> 464.84s]  Tree is still here. Okay this is just odd. Look oh there we go. Found you. Found you.
[464.84s -> 474.10s]  All right let's go find some more trees. Wow this is different. Hold on I gotta get a better view.
[474.10s -> 485.26s]  There's coal here too. Cool. So this is just a giant lava fountain of death. Uh nice. Nice.
[485.82s -> 497.19s]  Give me a rest of this coal. I'll take it. I'll take it all. I wonder what so what does this mean?
[498.12s -> 502.76s]  A lot of people freak out and they get excited when they see this. A lava fountain or a big
[502.76s -> 507.40s]  lava thing. Somebody tell me in the comments what what does this actually mean? Does this mean
[507.40s -> 514.58s]  anything in particular or is this just really cool looking? Don't want to lose my way because
[514.58s -> 522.28s]  that's happened before. I have totally lost my way. So I'm gonna make sure I'm leaving a breadcrumb
[522.28s -> 531.80s]  trail of torches to make sure I don't lose my damn place. Oh aren't these things worth something?
[532.36s -> 537.42s]  Can't I get like a couple pennies for these? Taking them anyways. All right don't forget
[537.42s -> 546.12s]  your breadcrumb trail. I don't have a so look at all these cows. I could eat this stuff for days.
[546.12s -> 551.48s]  Come on. Should have bought a sword. Bought a sword? You don't buy stuff in this game. What
[551.48s -> 564.02s]  am I talking about? Uh oh. Come here. You've been a bad cow. You deserve death. Nice. There are a lot
[564.02s -> 570.30s]  of cows and none of them really understand that I'm going to kill every single one of them.
[571.18s -> 577.11s]  And this guy. See you're just joining in on the party. You see you're just trying to be involved
[577.11s -> 581.43s]  and it's not cool man. We're just trying to hang out here and kill each other as cow friends.
[582.31s -> 587.18s]  I'm all right I'm hitting you with the no I don't want to do that. I was told that was a bad idea.
[589.54s -> 594.58s]  More of this stuff. I think it's wheat. All right no off don't get off track. Don't get off track.
[594.58s -> 606.33s]  I've got to find trees. No more beating up cows. Let's keep going. The never-ending trek to find
[606.33s -> 617.32s]  trees and a creeper and two creepers. Two creeper bastards and a spider. Um I'm going this way.
[618.28s -> 624.20s]  I'm going up to high ground. Hey cow. Get off of my mountain. This is mine. Oh this is gonna be
[624.20s -> 630.97s]  funny. Oh he died. Oh my god. I kind of feel bad. Does that happen to everybody? Will he die too?
[633.27s -> 640.01s]  I'm the king of the mountain baby. Sheep. Sheep. Sheep. I need the sheep. I need the sheep. I need
[640.01s -> 646.09s]  to make a bed. I don't care. I need the I need the wool. Get out of my face. Go ahead. Blow up.
[646.09s -> 651.93s]  Come on. Yeah. Yeah. That was exactly what I wanted. Awesome. Thank you creeper for killing
[651.93s -> 656.81s]  all of the other things that were here and leaving me just to collect the delicious
[656.81s -> 664.33s]  sap of life. All right die. Come here you. There we go. There's two. Need one more and I have a bed
[664.33s -> 669.05s]  and I don't ever have to worry about dying ever again. Actually I kind of do but still. Come here.
[671.69s -> 677.77s]  Die. All right. I got the wool I need but I want some chocolate wool. I want some chocolate milk.
[678.74s -> 682.74s]  If you punch the get out of here. Come on. I don't get all day.
[684.54s -> 687.18s]  I can just ready. I'm using the same strategy as I did before.
[687.74s -> 695.32s]  Blow up. No it didn't kill anybody. You go in here and drown. Leave me alone.
