[0.31s -> 14.20s]  Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 Facecam Fortress 2
[14.20s -> 20.52s]  Mondays edition. And I'm going to play as the engineer. I'm kind of late right now. Oh god,
[20.52s -> 24.64s]  there's only five, only five seconds and I've done, this is level one. This thing's going
[24.64s -> 31.26s]  down immediately, but this is on Thunder Mountain. And hopefully, come on, come on, come on,
[31.26s -> 36.75s]  come on, come on. Yes. At least it's level two.
[36.75s -> 47.71s]  From the JAG, the Frontier of Justice, and the pistol. Good to know. Spike. See if I
[47.71s -> 51.87s]  can not. What is this guy doing? I love this guy's hat, this chicken head thing. That's
[51.87s -> 60.71s]  from the Adult Swim Pyro Mania. Woo! Update. Somebody come on out. Is there anybody? Okay,
[60.71s -> 71.30s]  there's people in here, yes. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No ammo, no ammo. Oh, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[71.30s -> 79.94s]  Oh man, Scout. Why did you do that to me? Whoa, that's how you fall down. How is that,
[79.94s -> 87.30s]  how is that center still up? I have no idea. Looks like it's going to stay up. Of course
[87.30s -> 97.50s]  it is. Get this. Don't worry, it's going up. I got you. I got you, baby. Whoa, whoa, hold
[97.50s -> 109.98s]  on here. What I just, where is this guy? Is he back here? Anybody, anybody, anybody want
[109.98s -> 116.78s]  to take a shot in the face? You are a spy, for sure, I bet. No, you are not a spy. I
[116.78s -> 122.86s]  need to get that ammo. Oh my god, everyone just keeps picking up the ammo. Why must you
[122.86s -> 137.09s]  torment me like this, team? Sorry, I'll get it now. Sanctuary. It's still up. What a miracle.
[137.09s -> 143.72s]  I think it might be time for this thing to move. Yeah, come on. It might be time for
[143.72s -> 150.14s]  this thing to move. Maybe not quite. Come on, get the, where's the ammo? Where's the
[150.14s -> 156.50s]  ammo? That's going to be the title of this video. Where's the ammo? Get this thing to
[156.50s -> 172.13s]  level two at least. Spy around here. Speaking of spies, I better watch my butt. Level three.
[172.13s -> 181.41s]  Oh boy. You. Oh, you're going to do like the little sneaky snake move, huh? Not going to
[181.41s -> 192.34s]  work on me, baby. Well, I think at least we're winning. Technically, I guess. Come get some
[192.34s -> 203.01s]  help, man. Vote for the next map. Oh, what's that one? I got a feeling this is going down.
[203.01s -> 209.47s]  Yikes. That's what you do. And then you come over here and you, whoa, no, you don't. Let's see if
[209.47s -> 218.67s]  we can get out of here. Ready? Come on. Come on. Oh, nothing I could do there. Besides kill
[218.67s -> 233.19s]  back. No. Oh, what? I just found a hat. Cool. You have just found a hat in the comment section.
[233.19s -> 242.24s]  Somebody tell me, uh, what is the actual percentage of finding a hat? Is it 1% 0.2%? Like
[242.24s -> 252.49s]  what's the actual percentage? I'm actually pretty curious to know what that is. Hmm. Someone,
[252.49s -> 257.89s]  someone give me some, give me some ammo. Give me that sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick,
[257.89s -> 270.74s]  sick. This is sick. Level two going up. Oh, I just like pumped two shots at him. Just, just, just for
[270.74s -> 277.92s]  fun. Oh, don't want to. I need to keep at least a little bit in case they try and take it out. Oh,
[277.92s -> 289.50s]  he's hiding. Oh, he needs like one shot. Very good. Very good. I need to get some more ammo.
[289.50s -> 297.78s]  Come on. One of you bastards. Give me some of your stuff. I think that was it. Mmm. Save it. Oh,
[297.78s -> 306.52s]  it's not good. It's not good. It's going to go down. No, it won't. No, it won't. Give me these two
[306.52s -> 323.70s]  things. Oh, get away. Oh, no, you don't. Spy, you prickly little bastard. Oh, they are really
[323.70s -> 330.31s]  getting mad about this century. I need a dispenser, but there's no time. There's no time for that.
[332.31s -> 339.94s]  Whoa. Eight kills. This thing is on a rampage. Oh, do I dare? Do I dare put up a dispenser? I
[339.94s -> 356.46s]  don't know. Oh, I don't know. Okay. Whatever. Run. Hey, you are not. Oh, I had to run away.
[356.46s -> 367.32s]  I'm just putting a dispenser here. Oh, you got to be. You've got to be kidding me, man. No way. Oh,
[367.32s -> 374.97s]  that's. Wow. I can't believe that just happened. Boy, do you have a dead ringer? He must have had
[374.97s -> 387.83s]  a dead ringer. I had so many crits right there. Of course. Gosh. No. That's not the way I want to go.
[387.83s -> 395.19s]  I want to go this way right here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[395.19s -> 398.95s]  I feel like I was just on scare Saturdays right there. That was terrifying.
[409.06s -> 417.75s]  You are a spy. No, you're not. I've got to get a century up here. A good one. But yeah, like I
[417.75s -> 423.43s]  was saying, I really felt like I was on scare Saturdays right there. Spy just. Oh, that was so
[423.43s -> 431.83s]  horrible. I would have gone on such a tear. Oh, well, what can you do? Right? Put it right here.
[431.83s -> 440.42s]  They got to come through here. And when I got my stuff all built up, they ain't going to do anything.
[440.42s -> 450.06s]  They can just bumped into a spy. Speaking of spies. Here it comes. Come on. Get it to level two.
[450.06s -> 462.82s]  No. What is that guy doing? Wow. Okay. Kill him. Kill him. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no. Get out
[462.82s -> 471.50s]  of here. Get out of here. He's probably not dead. I would be very surprised if that guy was actually
[471.50s -> 486.46s]  dead. Maybe he is. Oh, the domination sound means he is. I think. Could be wrong on that one. Watch
[486.46s -> 498.23s]  it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Out of my way. Out of my way. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. By the way, what
[498.23s -> 505.61s]  I'm doing right now. Here's a little, a little engineer tip. So if you get in a situ. Okay. So
[505.61s -> 512.04s]  here's it. He didn't die. He's still right here, isn't he? No, he's not. So here's the engineer tip
[512.04s -> 517.96s]  I was just going to give you. When you are building something. Oh, God. When you are. I
[517.96s -> 522.36s]  can't even like get my tip off. There's so much chaos. When you are building something, right.
[522.36s -> 527.48s]  What you want to do is you want to hit it. Turn. Hit it. Turn. Hit it. Turn. You never lose any time.
[527.48s -> 533.74s]  You just are finding any spies behind you. So just like this. Ready? Bang. Swing. Bang. Swing. Bang.
[533.74s -> 537.74s]  Bang. You don't lose any time and it's a good way to watch behind you.
[537.74s -> 544.41s]  Just a little engineer tip when your back is turned to the fight. I think we're going to win.
[544.41s -> 554.38s]  I think we're actually going to win. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. Here comes the last push.
[554.38s -> 562.44s]  Well, not really. There's a minute and a half left. There's still plenty of time. Oh, yeah. Thanks,
[562.44s -> 568.50s]  Pyro. Hey, can you like repair my level three sentry dude? Thanks. Oh, homewrecker Pyro. I love
[568.50s -> 578.74s]  you. Engineer's best friend is a homewrecker Pyro. Oh, my, my nose is itchy. My nose is itchy,
[578.74s -> 581.38s]  but I can't, I don't want to itch it. I don't want to itch it. This is too important.
[582.02s -> 595.06s]  Oh, that guy's so dead. If he, if he pokes his head around. No. Oh, I just got to shoot him.
[596.22s -> 605.59s]  Oh, just let it die. He got, oh, oh, spy. They're going to win now. They're going to cap it. Oh,
[605.59s -> 615.64s]  get on there. Get on there. If I didn't miss him with my shotgun. No. Just get back over there
[615.64s -> 623.77s]  and do whatever you can. Just drop this right here. What? What? What just happened? What on
[623.77s -> 629.40s]  earth just happened right there? I got to get out here. Got to get out here. Come on, come on,
[629.40s -> 636.47s]  come on, come on, come on. This is very important. This is so important. This has to go up right now.
[636.47s -> 647.69s]  This is so important. So important. So important. No, no. Two Pyros. Two Pyros. Four, three, two,
[648.42s -> 657.99s]  one. Oh, I was scared there for a second. That was pretty terrifying. But thanks for watching,
[657.99s -> 667.24s]  guys. This episode of Facecam Fortress 2, Dr. Pepper, Clang, and now we're changing maps. Oh,
[667.24s -> 672.34s]  my God. I'm going to burp. I don't want to burp to end it. See you guys next time. Take care, everybody.
