[0.50s -> 6.06s]  Ooh. Oh, he got me! He got us! Hey, happy Halloween.
[6.06s -> 13.99s]  How are ya? Uh, those of you that are trick-or-treating,
[13.99s -> 27.62s]  aren't you a little old for that? Go back inside.
[27.62s -> 34.54s]  I'm five. Well, you're a super genius. How did you find this stream if you're
[34.54s -> 48.55s]  five? Same, same, same. I got recommended this
[48.55s -> 56.49s]  channel on Roblox. Oh, nice! What is this? 8 out of 10
[56.49s -> 60.54s]  germa? What is this? Do I need to watch this? 8 out of 10
[60.62s -> 66.81s]  germa impression? Wait, why can I only get this through one
[66.81s -> 70.95s]  headphone? All right, hold on. Let me listen to this.
[70.95s -> 84.28s]  Okay, what is it? Is this like, is this like your stream?
[84.28s -> 91.64s]  Am I able to like listen to a clip of your stream?
[91.64s -> 96.57s]  Link it to me? I can't see it. I don't even like it. It scrolled by too fast.
[96.57s -> 103.51s]  It's Ster. What the fuck did he do now? What is he trying to do?
[103.51s -> 117.91s]  Why can I not hear this? Okay, you can hear this, but I can't.
[117.91s -> 123.64s]  For some insane reason. It's not going through my like
[123.64s -> 133.85s]  Vive headphones. Well, now what the fuck happened? I just broke everything.
[133.85s -> 143.74s]  Now I can't hear anything coming through here. Hold on, open up my mixer.
[143.74s -> 151.11s]  What the fuck? It's not, it sounds not coming through my Vive headset anymore.
[151.11s -> 162.42s]  Now it is. Oh, here we go. Okay, here we go. What does he say?
[162.42s -> 177.19s]  2020. Okay. I don't think I can stream for four months.
[177.19s -> 181.19s]  He doesn't even get it. He doesn't even, hold on.
[181.67s -> 188.17s]  I'm putting this on stream. We need to break this down.
[188.17s -> 197.42s]  That's not even why that happened. Ster's impression of Germa
[197.42s -> 209.51s]  in the year 2020. I don't think I can stream for four months.
[209.51s -> 215.03s]  Yeah, he's a funny guy. Yeah, nice form by the way.
[215.03s -> 219.75s]  Nice form by the way. Almost saw your balls on Twitch. Almost just got
[219.75s -> 229.03s]  permabanned, Star. Real funny. That was real close to a
[229.03s -> 234.95s]  ball sack on stream. It's close. Was it still funny?
[234.95s -> 242.78s]  Yeah, it was pretty funny. All right, why don't I come over so you can
[242.78s -> 248.97s]  you can see this. This music is, why this,
[248.97s -> 252.17s]  the scary music makes that so much worse.
[252.17s -> 258.44s]  This is like found footage of me watching Star
[258.44s -> 262.52s]  start making fun of me and then what does he like stalk me and murder me?
[262.52s -> 276.76s]  It started with one video clip. Bugle, we need Bugleberry.
[276.76s -> 281.03s]  I'm sorry to say Bugleberry actually contacted me.
[281.03s -> 285.67s]  He was just rambling. He said that he's not into Halloween anymore.
[285.67s -> 288.39s]  He said he's different, he doesn't want to do it anymore, he doesn't want to be a
[288.39s -> 291.74s]  one-trick pony. He kind of went all over this. I was like,
[291.74s -> 293.58s]  what are you talking about? He started rambling about
[293.58s -> 298.62s]  different recipes he was working on and hams and turkeys and shit and I was like,
[298.62s -> 301.42s]  I was like, dude, just call me later. Like, you obviously kind of, you're
[301.42s -> 308.79s]  fucked up right now. Maybe I'll talk to him tomorrow, see what
[308.79s -> 317.54s]  he's up to. Anyways, yeah, we're gonna do VR tonight,
[317.54s -> 321.61s]  Halloween VR, which, no, don't turn it off, don't turn it off. I'm here, I'm here.
[321.61s -> 324.17s]  No, don't beep and turn it off, you fuckers. Don't.
[324.17s -> 340.15s]  Why? Don't do that. Okay, so. All right. Why is it the wrong hand?
[340.15s -> 343.75s]  Stop opening the door and trying to kill me. Wait a minute, I need to make sure
[343.75s -> 347.35s]  this is on the right hand because I, if you don't use VR for fucking 10 minutes,
[347.35s -> 354.84s]  it turns everything off. All right, we're good. Let me, hey, let me, why don't we just,
[354.84s -> 361.58s]  I'll just show you. What's up? You like my Halloween costume?
[361.58s -> 364.54s]  I can't do a Halloween costume anymore. I'm 35. I can't, that's when you're not
[364.54s -> 372.63s]  allowed to wear a Halloween costume anymore. I just have to be MrTwitch.tv guy.
[372.63s -> 375.99s]  You're a man-child. No, I would be a man-child if I was in a
[375.99s -> 378.23s]  Halloween costume, like of Sonic the Hedgehog,
[378.23s -> 386.46s]  right? No, I'm a professional Twitch virtual reality streamer. Yes, I was
[386.46s -> 390.78s]  Naruto last year, but I was still in the 18 to 34 drop-down bracket.
[390.78s -> 395.10s]  I can't do that anymore. See you next year when I'm dressed up like a fucking
[395.10s -> 409.51s]  pineapple. Happy Halloween. Let's go. You ready?
[409.51s -> 417.98s]  Clip that. Good, clip it. I'll be a pineapple next year.
[417.98s -> 421.74s]  Did I gain weight? I gained a shitload of weight. Yeah, thank you for asking. I
[421.74s -> 429.00s]  gained about 20 pounds. We relax and we just wait until we go
[429.00s -> 431.96s]  into a live stream, okay? Especially if you, you know how it's
[431.96s -> 438.60s]  like. I know it's a small window. I'll fix it.
[438.60s -> 442.76s]  Full screen. I know, I will, I will. Motherfucker, we're gonna do like five or six games tonight.
[442.76s -> 446.92s]  It's gonna be nuts. Starting with, what's the name of this game?
[446.92s -> 452.86s]  Affect the Manor? Affected the Manor is the name of this game.
[452.86s -> 457.70s]  This game's apparently only like, it's loud.
[457.70s -> 461.94s]  Uh, this game is apparently only like 20 minutes long. It's just a haunted house.
[461.94s -> 466.84s]  So we're gonna do Haunted House and then we're gonna move on to Hospitality VR
[466.84s -> 470.54s]  and then we're doing Five Nights at Fucking Freddy's VR.
[470.54s -> 475.69s]  It's all VR and it's all scary. And then if we're gonna do Walking Dead VR,
[475.69s -> 479.13s]  we're gonna do, there's a lot. I'm going in. You guys ready?
[479.13s -> 486.30s]  You need anything else from me before we start? This is why I wanted to start a
[486.30s -> 488.30s]  little later too. I wanted to be like night time.
[488.30s -> 495.03s]  Put it full screen. Yeah, I got it. See? See?
[495.03s -> 498.95s]  Um, is the space game too big? I've gotten a good spawn.
[498.95s -> 504.30s]  Underwear. Those of you that were in the pre-stream chat, we were talking about if
[504.30s -> 508.06s]  I were to walk out here, be on stream like this,
[508.06s -> 512.14s]  and be like in VR. Oh, what's all scary? Look out!
[512.14s -> 516.54s]  Oh, I got it with the lightsaber, right? And then after like 40 minutes, I back up
[516.54s -> 520.89s]  and it's just fucking white underwear and bare legs.
[520.89s -> 524.57s]  I wanted to, I did be like, I would do it. Well, I can't. Like, I would get, I would
[524.57s -> 528.71s]  get thrown off. And then like, I would look at the chat
[528.71s -> 531.51s]  and everyone would be like, dude, underwear, what the fuck?
[531.51s -> 538.57s]  And I would, and then it would cut to a pre-recorded video of me waking up
[538.57s -> 546.62s]  in a bed and being like, oh shit, what a nightmare.
[546.62s -> 551.54s]  But yeah, I didn't do it. And then I like get out of bed and like come in here and
[551.54s -> 560.81s]  I stream. Another time. Low effort streamer.
[560.81s -> 566.26s]  And maybe the last month. That's not even true though.
[566.26s -> 571.35s]  He's getting drunk? I have like three of these.
[571.35s -> 574.55s]  This is like, this is the equivalent of drinking one beer.
[574.55s -> 579.03s]  I don't, I'm not gonna get shitfaced off of three beers.
[579.03s -> 586.58s]  I'll get very talkative though. What am I drinking?
[586.58s -> 591.06s]  Uh, a thing that makes me an evil, an evil mastermind.
[591.06s -> 595.69s]  I'm just gonna switch between all the seltzers. That's like the new thing that
[595.69s -> 601.40s]  I want to do. Not White Claw. This is truly the same
[601.40s -> 606.39s]  goddamn thing. Just different companies. Okay, I, I, okay, I had the Xbox. This is
[606.39s -> 611.21s]  the PlayStation. What's the Nintendo switch of the like
[611.21s -> 621.37s]  weird gross seltzer companies? The Bud Light one? I don't know. I
[621.37s -> 627.42s]  know. I feel like Bud Light would be Xbox. Truly, this is, this probably is the
[627.42s -> 638.26s]  switch. Oh, so I got it. You're drinking the Luigi of
[638.26s -> 643.75s]  Drinks. It's, I actually don't even hate it. I,
[643.75s -> 647.67s]  look, it's, I know, it's fun to make fun of truly,
[647.67s -> 651.90s]  right? And like White Claw. But look, if they're on sale,
[651.90s -> 655.34s]  you're gonna get them, right? If you're of drinking age and you want to drink a
[655.34s -> 661.51s]  couple, if they're on sale, why not? Stop buying fancy Instagram drinks and
[661.51s -> 667.46s]  upgrade your PC. This was like four, this was like three dollars.
[667.46s -> 672.02s]  It's like, it's like six grand for a PC that I want to make.
[672.10s -> 679.21s]  Seven grand. It's fancy Instagram drink. I bought this twice in my life.
[679.21s -> 684.94s]  I'm getting a 3090. I'm getting a fucking 32 core PC.
[684.94s -> 688.38s]  I'm getting a fucking case that can embed into the wall.
[688.38s -> 693.18s]  I'm gonna get wireless everything. Wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, wireless
[693.18s -> 695.66s]  microphone, wireless headphones, wireless
[695.66s -> 707.82s]  motherboard, everything. And I'm also, I'm gonna get a desk that can go
[707.82s -> 710.92s]  right here. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, it's gonna be
[710.92s -> 718.30s]  fucking incredible. Please don't waste money on a 3090.
[718.30s -> 723.56s]  You know, I actually heard that. I heard that like, don't buy a 3090. What are you
[723.56s -> 727.00s]  stupid? It's like, it doesn't do anything. But I
[727.00s -> 730.20s]  got, I want to get it for the, the Nvink, the codec. I want it to be
[730.20s -> 738.47s]  rendering the stream at like fucking 1080. Instagram drinks. Do people like post
[738.47s -> 748.44s]  themselves drinking these on Instagram? Why? What? It's like, this is not, this is
[748.44s -> 754.82s]  not cool. This is cool. Am I cool for doing this?
[754.82s -> 758.30s]  Wait, hold on. Somebody get one of these. I'm gonna get an image of this.
[758.38s -> 760.86s]  And I don't want you to put it like, I want you to put like the Instagram like
[760.86s -> 768.62s]  like and follow button and shit down here. And like put a filter on me. Put like a
[768.62s -> 774.86s]  bunch, put like six filters on me. I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't
[774.86s -> 777.34s]  have done that because now like, okay, I have nothing to do with this fucking
[777.34s -> 779.90s]  company. I just bought this because I want to drink it so I like it.
[779.90s -> 787.27s]  I want like all the, like the dashboard of Instagram.
[787.27s -> 792.14s]  Stop advertising. I, I, but if I drink a Coke on stream, you're gonna see Coke. If
[792.14s -> 796.30s]  I drink a fucking Sprite on stream, how's that any different? It's the, it's
[796.30s -> 809.18s]  the same thing. Don't I just put tape on this? Cover it up.
[809.18s -> 814.22s]  Go put electrical tape on this. No, if I put electrical tape on this, this is not
[814.22s -> 817.34s]  truly, this is like some kind of weird fucking potion that I made.
[817.34s -> 826.49s]  That's like dangerous. All right, let's go. No more Stalin. Let's go.
[826.49s -> 841.99s]  That's cool. VR sucks. Okay. All right, so thanks. VR
[842.07s -> 845.99s]  sucks. Oh, by the way, I'm ready to go tonight. You know why?
[845.99s -> 849.27s]  Can I show this? I'm just gonna show a little bit, okay? Just enough for you to
[849.27s -> 857.29s]  see it. Where is it? Just enough for you to see.
[857.29s -> 863.51s]  I'm taped up today. I'm taped the fuck up today.
[863.51s -> 866.95s]  I'm covered in like, in this like, in this fucking body tape and I'm ready to
[866.95s -> 873.43s]  take on the entire world. I got it going across my back. I go wrapping around
[873.43s -> 893.00s]  here. Like a diaper. You have a colostomy bag on.
[893.00s -> 897.03s]  Why is he taped up? Because it's like body tape.
[897.03s -> 899.99s]  It's to like support your like muscles and back and chest. It's like, it's
[899.99s -> 903.94s]  support tape. Got it already? All right, look, when I
[903.94s -> 910.86s]  go in, I don't come out. All right, this is not the filter I was
[910.86s -> 916.22s]  talking about. This is not, no, I didn't want it to be like,
[916.22s -> 927.98s]  like a, like a nuclear bomb going off. This is like the sun exploded.
[927.98s -> 930.86s]  This is the last thing I do before the sun explodes.
[930.86s -> 939.51s]  Gotta get those likes on Instagram before the sun like takes over us all.
[939.51s -> 956.54s]  Hey, ah, sun just exploded. Might as well enjoy it with a fucking truly.
[956.54s -> 959.98s]  There's no way that I could get 2,000 likes on Instagram. What are you talking
[959.98s -> 963.82s]  about? I could get like 50,000. I'll show it,
[963.82s -> 967.38s]  I'll show you. What do you mean I can't get 2,000 likes on
[967.38s -> 969.86s]  Instagram? Are you kidding me? If I had an Instagram, it would be
[969.86s -> 973.38s]  loaded with likes. Every like would be, it would be, it would be double liked.
[973.38s -> 978.57s]  It'd be 10,000. All right, I'm ready. Let's get, I'm gonna,
[978.57s -> 983.93s]  let me just try to finish my fucking blueberry and I almost just dropped it.
[983.93s -> 995.48s]  Does Bugleberry have an Instagram? No, but I'm gonna be here for a while, okay?
[995.48s -> 999.82s]  This is all I got going on tonight. I'm not, I'm just, I'm gonna,
[999.82s -> 1011.78s]  you got me tonight, okay? Dropped all of his loot.
[1011.78s -> 1016.28s]  All right, let's go. Already stalling. I'm not stalling. This, this game's only like
[1016.28s -> 1020.90s]  10,000. All right, I'm ready. This is called, uh,
[1020.98s -> 1033.08s]  affected it the manner. The reason why this is like five times tighter than it was
[1033.08s -> 1038.60s]  three days ago. Why is it so tight? What happened? Oh shit, it's because
[1038.60s -> 1056.74s]  of this. I didn't do that. All right, that's better. Okay, let's go.
[1056.74s -> 1060.26s]  This is effect, this is a haunted house. You go through it, it takes about 15
[1060.26s -> 1064.17s]  minutes. Almost as long as I've been stalling,
[1064.17s -> 1080.47s]  drinking, truleys on stream. Right or left? Just make this shit green
[1080.47s -> 1087.37s]  so I can fucking see it. Okay, you ready? Well, this is, this is
[1087.37s -> 1093.42s]  horrifying. This is really scary sounds. Okay, this is
[1093.42s -> 1097.43s]  scary sounds. This is what you guys have been hearing
[1097.43s -> 1105.74s]  this whole time? Okay, I wanted to, where do I go?
[1105.74s -> 1122.54s]  Stop, gauntlet. Can I take a candle? I think I have to go this way. Here we
[1122.54s -> 1131.82s]  go. Your pants are falling, you're on. Okay,
[1131.82s -> 1141.16s]  here we go. Haunted house, haunted media. Happy Halloween everybody.
[1141.16s -> 1144.84s]  Warning, this experience is intense and uses jumpscares, loud noises, and
[1144.84s -> 1147.64s]  flashing images. Do not play if you have any known health issues or
[1147.64s -> 1150.68s]  nervous disposition. Your discretion is advised.
[1150.68s -> 1155.96s]  That's, wait, I'm getting the don't ride this if you have a medical condition
[1155.96s -> 1168.22s]  thing? I mean, I have a few medical conditions.
[1168.22s -> 1185.14s]  Fucked. Don't die. Okay, that's the house. Can I go any faster?
[1185.22s -> 1202.57s]  Fast as I can go. Oh, I already don't like this. I already hate this shit.
[1202.57s -> 1206.78s]  You guys know that before YouTube and Twitch,
[1206.78s -> 1214.73s]  I did not ever play scary games because I can't play them and I hate to play them.
[1214.73s -> 1226.84s]  I am of a nervous disposition. I don't, I hate this.
[1226.84s -> 1230.95s]  Damn. I have to be strong. It's Halloween night.
[1230.95s -> 1254.44s]  I think I need to wipe the lenses. What the fuck are you doing?
[1254.44s -> 1292.52s]  Right? That's it, right? What? That was good.
[1292.52s -> 1296.68s]  That was really good. You know, I know that was good. You can,
[1296.68s -> 1299.32s]  you can minus two it if you want. I don't, I wasn't trying to be funny. I was showing
[1299.32s -> 1314.62s]  you how good I was. Alright, Satan door. That was, uh, I'm
[1314.62s -> 1319.66s]  not ready for this part yet. I'm not ready for that yet. Is there
[1319.66s -> 1329.48s]  anything else I can do in here? Let's see what's behind door number two.
[1329.48s -> 1340.76s]  Oh, I don't want to go in there.
[1340.76s -> 1354.34s]  Ass cracked? Fuck off. What? Alright. In the house. I went through door
[1354.34s -> 1373.08s]  number two. Can't go up there. Imagine doing this in
[1373.08s -> 1376.04s]  real life. Why would you ever do this in real life?
[1376.04s -> 1380.44s]  I feel like ghost hunters and shit. Stay fucking home.
[1380.44s -> 1390.95s]  Stay home. That was horrible. Oh my god. I felt like my whole
[1391.03s -> 1396.22s]  house exploded. Seven? Alright, this door is number seven. Remember that.
[1396.22s -> 1406.18s]  Like who cares if the place is haunted? Don't you think that's a little condescending
[1406.18s -> 1409.46s]  to the ghost that's there? Like the ghost is just trying to exist
[1409.46s -> 1413.69s]  in peace and you're in there with like your fucking ecto meter.
[1413.69s -> 1428.04s]  Hey, can you hear us? Like yeah, I can. Please get the fuck out of my house. I am
[1428.04s -> 1443.56s]  on the nervous disposition. That was a kid laughing in reverse.

[1719.42s -> 1722.06s]  them like in a vault or something. You don't show them in your house. You're
[1722.06s -> 1726.55s]  gonna scare the fuck out anybody that you can't have friends over with a

[5517.83s -> 5535.01s]  What do I do with Foxy?
[5535.01s -> 5555.83s]  Shit, I lost the chicken.
[5555.83s -> 5566.91s]  Who am I missing?
[5566.91s -> 5567.91s]  Where's Foxy?

[5592.07s -> 5596.62s]  Hello?
[5596.62s -> 5598.12s]  What does that mean?
[5598.12s -> 5599.12s]  It's the balloon kid.
[5600.42s -> 5602.42s]  Alright, balloon kid is currently in the bed right now.
[5602.42s -> 5604.42s]  What do I do about- shine a light in his eyes.
[5604.42s -> 5605.73s]  Is that what you do?
[5605.73s -> 5607.80s]  What do you do?
[5607.80s -> 5608.80s]  Do I shine a light in his eyes?
[5608.80s -> 5612.34s]  Can my ass go work on?
[5612.34s -> 5613.34s]  Hey, you little fuck.

[5757.79s -> 5758.79s]  Hello?

[5773.42s -> 5774.79s]  Ring it.
[5774.79s -> 5775.79s]  Ring it.
[5775.79s -> 5776.79s]  Holy fuck.
[5776.79s -> 5792.50s]  I didn't even mean to do that.
[5792.50s -> 5796.30s]  I won.
[5796.30s -> 5800.86s]  Gamer instinct.
[5800.86s -> 5802.74s]  Stick of butter.
[5802.74s -> 5804.94s]  Stick of butter.
[5804.94s -> 5806.94s]  I don't know why we have a stick of butter.
[5806.94s -> 5816.22s]  Game for babies.
[5816.22s -> 5819.88s]  Uh.
[5819.88s -> 5820.88s]  Night 3.
[5820.88s -> 5824.57s]  Do I dare even attempt Night 3?
[5824.57s -> 5825.57s]  Sure.
[5825.57s -> 5826.57s]  If I'm gonna...
[5826.57s -> 5827.57s]  I mean, I'm gonna go...
[5827.57s -> 5828.57s]  This is where the game gets real.
[5828.57s -> 5830.32s]  Right?
[5830.32s -> 5831.32s]  I'm now out of the tutorial.
[5831.32s -> 5841.30s]  I know how it works.
[5841.30s -> 5842.30s]  Hot damn stone cold.
[5842.30s -> 5844.30s]  This is where the real game begins.
[5844.30s -> 5845.54s]  Yeah.
[5845.54s -> 5856.32s]  Take a look.
[5856.32s -> 5863.77s]  Yeah.
[5863.77s -> 5864.77s]  I think so.
[5864.77s -> 5866.77s]  Oxy did appear in the hallway.
[5869.77s -> 5874.06s]  Chicken's already gone.
[5880.57s -> 5881.57s]  Where's the chicken?
[5882.57s -> 5884.19s]  Chicken in here?
[5888.85s -> 5896.55s]  Where did you go?
[5898.55s -> 5916.39s]  Get out of here, man.
[5917.39s -> 5918.39s]  Come on, man.
[5920.02s -> 5921.02s]  Get out of here, man.
[5923.02s -> 5935.65s]  Dude.
[5935.65s -> 5938.10s]  You?
[5938.10s -> 5940.18s]  This person there pissed me.
[5940.18s -> 5953.77s]  Shit.
[5953.77s -> 5955.52s]  Where's the bird?
[5955.52s -> 5957.14s]  Where's the...
[5957.14s -> 5958.14s]  Where's the...
[5958.14s -> 5959.14s]  Yes.
[5959.14s -> 5965.70s]  Yeah.

[5978.87s -> 5982.14s]  Yeah.
[5982.14s -> 5983.51s]  You.
[5983.51s -> 5984.51s]  Oh.
[5984.51s -> 5988.63s]  Chicken?
[5988.63s -> 5994.61s]  Yeah.
[5996.30s -> 5999.11s]  How did you get through my shield?
[5999.11s -> 6001.11s]  How did you get through my shield?
[6001.11s -> 6004.31s]  I had a shield.
[6004.31s -> 6005.31s]  What?
[6005.31s -> 6006.31s]  What happened?
[6006.31s -> 6010.24s]  How did he get through the shield?
[6010.24s -> 6011.24s]  How did he get through the shield?
[6011.24s -> 6018.02s]  Oxy is defeated by the flashlight.
[6018.02s -> 6019.02s]  Oh, right.
[6019.02s -> 6020.02s]  You have to like...
[6020.02s -> 6021.02s]  And he'll go away.
[6021.02s -> 6022.78s]  All right.
[6022.78s -> 6028.75s]  Let's go back to the basement.
[6028.75s -> 6031.75s]  Every jump scare, I get electrocuted with 200 volts.
[6031.75s -> 6035.91s]  That's just what your body does.
[6035.91s -> 6036.91s]  I've been...
[6036.91s -> 6037.91s]  Fuck.
[6037.91s -> 6039.91s]  I'm gonna change the title of this stream.
[6039.91s -> 6042.91s]  Watch a guy get electrocuted over and over again.
[6042.91s -> 6044.54s]  You know what?
[6044.54s -> 6048.54s]  If anyone wanted to make like a compilation of all the jump scares, but put like a...
[6048.54s -> 6050.54s]  Like electricity noise before it.
[6050.54s -> 6053.48s]  Just guys shocking himself.
[6053.48s -> 6060.54s]  What happened?
[6060.54s -> 6067.03s]  Oy vey.
[6067.03s -> 6071.60s]  From a race car?
[6071.60s -> 6075.76s]  I don't know what that is.
[6075.76s -> 6076.76s]  Get me out of here.
[6076.76s -> 6095.66s]  Shut it down.
[6095.66s -> 6096.66s]  Shut it down.
[6096.66s -> 6097.66s]  No escape.
[6097.66s -> 6098.84s]  Would you recommend it against sleepiness?
[6098.84s -> 6100.14s]  What?
[6100.14s -> 6101.14s]  Did it break?
[6101.14s -> 6108.27s]  Shut it down.
[6108.27s -> 6114.82s]  How do I leave?
[6114.82s -> 6120.16s]  Restart?
[6120.16s -> 6122.10s]  Oh, okay.
[6122.10s -> 6124.05s]  Start it?
[6124.05s -> 6125.05s]  Restart the game.
[6125.05s -> 6132.75s]  That button.
[6132.75s -> 6133.93s]  Where's that button?
[6133.93s -> 6140.16s]  Where do I restart?
[6140.16s -> 6144.47s]  Library, store, exit game and then just restart it?
[6144.47s -> 6146.47s]  I lost you guys.
[6146.47s -> 6153.02s]  What?
[6153.02s -> 6158.10s]  Shut it down.
[6158.10s -> 6159.28s]  Exit.
[6159.28s -> 6160.28s]  Yeah.
[6160.28s -> 6167.73s]  Hold on.
[6167.73s -> 6168.73s]  Oh, here we go.
[6168.73s -> 6170.61s]  Okay.
[6170.61s -> 6171.61s]  Just open it back up.
[6171.61s -> 6176.62s]  Hey, there we go.
[6176.62s -> 6177.62s]  Turn off your PC.
[6177.62s -> 6183.22s]  What's wrong with this chat?
[6183.22s -> 6184.22s]  What do you mean?
[6184.22s -> 6185.52s]  Wait.
[6185.52s -> 6189.64s]  Launch.
[6189.64s -> 6197.15s]  First gamer moment of 2020.
[6197.15s -> 6198.15s]  Why?
[6198.15s -> 6199.15s]  What do you mean?
[6199.15s -> 6200.39s]  What happened?
[6200.39s -> 6208.16s]  Yeah.
[6208.16s -> 6209.16s]  Relax.
[6209.16s -> 6210.91s]  What?
[6210.91s -> 6211.91s]  You actually did it, Omega Lowell.
[6211.91s -> 6212.91s]  What are you talking about?
[6212.91s -> 6213.91s]  What did I do wrong?
[6213.91s -> 6221.23s]  Continue.
[6221.23s -> 6229.26s]  All right.
[6229.26s -> 6230.26s]  Let's try the other ones.
[6230.26s -> 6231.26s]  So that was two.
[6231.26s -> 6232.26s]  This is three.
[6232.26s -> 6238.31s]  I have this weird memory of Five Nights at Freddy's 3 being terrible.
[6238.31s -> 6243.39s]  This is the one that sucks, right?
[6243.39s -> 6244.39s]  Yes.
[6244.39s -> 6246.58s]  Kind of.
[6246.58s -> 6248.58s]  Well, you might as well see it.
[6248.58s -> 6254.29s]  What's the one where you're in the bedroom and you're like the little kid in the bedroom?
[6254.29s -> 6260.33s]  Hey, hey.
[6260.33s -> 6262.33s]  Glad you came back for another night.
[6262.33s -> 6264.53s]  It'll be a lot better.
[6264.53s -> 6272.49s]  What did I do?
[6272.49s -> 6273.49s]  That was light.
[6273.49s -> 6274.49s]  That was vent.
[6274.49s -> 6275.49s]  I pressed that button.
[6275.49s -> 6276.49s]  No, no, no.
[6276.49s -> 6280.35s]  Hey, man.
[6280.35s -> 6281.35s]  Hey, Bart.

[6284.59s -> 6286.73s]  Totally, man.
[6286.73s -> 6302.32s]  I'll get you to school on time.
[6302.32s -> 6305.32s]  I like this one because the screen is bigger.
[6305.32s -> 6322.41s]  Is there a light I can put in here?
[6322.41s -> 6331.46s]  Oh, yeah.
[6331.46s -> 6332.46s]  This one sucks.
[6332.46s -> 6333.46s]  It's the bunny that...
[6333.46s -> 6334.46s]  Yeah, this one's not good.
[6334.46s -> 6335.46s]  I don't like this one.
[6335.46s -> 6336.46s]  This one sucks.
[6337.46s -> 6341.53s]  I played this on iPad and I was like, this game sucks.
