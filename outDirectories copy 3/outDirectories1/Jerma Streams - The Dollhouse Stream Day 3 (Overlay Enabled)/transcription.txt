[520.70s -> 522.70s]  Hey, whoa.
[522.70s -> 524.70s]  Daba, atibatalo.
[524.70s -> 526.70s]  Ho ho.
[526.70s -> 608.97s]  That's our family.
[608.97s -> 629.19s]  Let's see my armpits.
[629.19s -> 743.18s]  So I'm not lifting my arms up.
[743.18s -> 864.62s]  Woo.
[864.62s -> 1005.10s]  Yep.
[1005.10s -> 1090.52s]  I can't believe we're gonna see like the lip I was just doing at the start.
[1093.85s -> 1104.84s]  Ho ho ho ho ho.
[1104.84s -> 1129.35s]  Woo. Just a little too big.
[1129.35s -> 1268.30s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1268.30s -> 1353.98s]  I can't believe we're gonna see like the lip I was just doing at the start.
[1357.18s -> 1360.25s]  Ho ho ho ho ho.
[1360.25s -> 1369.62s]  Woo.
[1369.62s -> 1392.02s]  Just a little too big.
[1392.02s -> 1394.02s]  Just a little too big.
[1394.02s -> 1686.86s]  Ah.
[1686.86s -> 1700.22s]  I'm a streamer, buddy.
[1700.22s -> 1703.42s]  I'm a streamer, buddy. It's me, German985, here.
[1703.42s -> 1705.42s]  Just, um,
[1705.42s -> 1707.66s]  getting to my house that was just recently fixed
[1707.66s -> 1709.66s]  and upgraded, hopefully.
[1709.66s -> 1721.30s]  If I put too much pressure on it, it just...
[1721.30s -> 1723.54s]  Ow.
[1723.54s -> 1726.62s]  Uh...
[1726.62s -> 1730.76s]  How's everybody doing?
[1730.76s -> 1733.00s]  How's everybody doing?
[1733.00s -> 1735.00s]  Hopefully, everybody's okay.
[1735.00s -> 1737.00s]  Hopefully, everybody's feeling okay.
[1737.00s -> 1739.00s]  Hopefully, everybody's doing okay.
[1739.00s -> 1741.00s]  I am not
[1741.00s -> 1743.18s]  doing okay.
[1743.18s -> 1745.18s]  This is probably the worst I've ever felt
[1745.18s -> 1747.18s]  since...
[1747.18s -> 1749.48s]  I don't know. I don't have a barometer
[1749.48s -> 1751.48s]  for this because this is the worst ever.
[1751.48s -> 1755.75s]  Oh, yeah.
[1755.75s -> 1758.06s]  What do we got up here?
[1758.06s -> 1767.06s]  What's this? Wait, wait.
[1767.06s -> 1769.06s]  I got trapped in the wall.
[1769.06s -> 1771.06s]  I got trapped in the wall.
[1771.06s -> 1774.26s]  I got stuck in the wall.
[1774.26s -> 1776.26s]  I can't...
[1776.26s -> 1778.26s]  There it is. Okay, I got stuck back there.
[1778.26s -> 1782.74s]  I got stuck in the wall.
[1782.74s -> 1787.48s]  What is this?
[1787.48s -> 1791.37s]  Ooh.
[1791.37s -> 1794.18s]  I didn't know about this.
[1794.18s -> 1796.42s]  This looks like a staircase.
[1796.42s -> 1799.30s]  Oh, this is... I really like what they did here.
[1799.30s -> 1802.06s]  Ooh.
[1802.06s -> 1804.94s]  Second floor.
[1804.94s -> 1808.31s]  Wow.
[1808.31s -> 1811.96s]  Interesting stuff.
[1811.96s -> 1813.96s]  I finished this one. This one wasn't finished.
[1813.96s -> 1816.14s]  I was going to hopefully do some of that
[1816.14s -> 1818.14s]  today.
[1818.14s -> 1820.14s]  Some work, but I don't
[1820.14s -> 1822.14s]  feel like doing any work right now.
[1822.14s -> 1824.89s]  They told me
[1824.89s -> 1826.89s]  that I can finish it however I wanted.
[1826.89s -> 1835.83s]  What else is up here?
[1835.83s -> 1837.83s]  Oh, yes, the stuff
[1837.83s -> 1839.83s]  I bought. Bed.
[1839.83s -> 1842.39s]  Another bedroom.
[1842.39s -> 1845.21s]  This one gives me less
[1845.21s -> 1847.21s]  comfort than this one.
[1847.21s -> 1855.21s]  I look like Clark Kent.
[1855.21s -> 1857.45s]  But if he was smaller,
[1857.45s -> 1859.45s]  didn't go to law school, and never went
[1859.45s -> 1864.63s]  to the gym.
[1864.63s -> 1866.63s]  I look like fucking Otacon.
[1866.63s -> 1870.79s]  Yes, Snake.
[1870.79s -> 1872.79s]  What you need to do is... But I'm not
[1872.79s -> 1874.79s]  smart enough to be that guy.
[1874.79s -> 1880.81s]  I like this bedroom though. Yay,
[1880.81s -> 1883.37s]  ow. So if you guys that weren't
[1883.37s -> 1885.37s]  here yesterday,
[1885.37s -> 1887.37s]  the old house got kind of burnt,
[1887.37s -> 1889.37s]  and we got some insurance money,
[1889.37s -> 1891.37s]  which was immediately used to
[1891.37s -> 1893.37s]  fix the damage and to upgrade
[1893.37s -> 1897.66s]  the home.
[1897.66s -> 1899.66s]  So now we have two floors.
[1899.66s -> 1902.79s]  We've got a DIY room.
[1902.79s -> 1905.16s]  And we've got all the other rooms that you've
[1905.16s -> 1908.04s]  seen already. Thank you.
[1908.04s -> 1910.04s]  Oh my god.
[1910.04s -> 1914.20s]  Now the thing about these stairs is they go down
[1914.20s -> 1916.20s]  pretty far. This is a very high, this is a very far
[1916.20s -> 1918.57s]  house. So it
[1918.57s -> 1920.57s]  takes a few minutes to get down the stairs.
[1920.57s -> 1924.28s]  Takes about 10 seconds. A very
[1924.28s -> 1927.29s]  big house. That was just huge.
[1927.29s -> 1932.98s]  That's not the bathroom.
[1932.98s -> 1934.98s]  That's not the bathroom. I went
[1934.98s -> 1939.21s]  the wrong door. That's the wrong door.
[1939.21s -> 1941.21s]  I gotta go to the bathroom real
[1941.21s -> 1947.93s]  bad. Thank you.
[1954.97s -> 1956.97s]  Get out of here. I don't even want to use it.
[1962.84s -> 1971.29s]  I don't think I've washed my hands in a
[1971.29s -> 1974.81s]  week and a half.
[1974.81s -> 1976.81s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[1976.81s -> 1978.81s]  Okay, is it healed yet?
[1978.81s -> 1982.07s]  Let's find out.
[1982.07s -> 1985.90s]  I feel better.
[1985.90s -> 1989.78s]  Can I get this off too?
[1991.78s -> 1994.92s]  Oh shit, this is clipped on.
[1994.92s -> 1997.42s]  This is clipped on to my
[1997.42s -> 1999.42s]  body. It's gonna stay.
[1999.42s -> 2001.42s]  I just have bird shit on me.
[2001.42s -> 2003.42s]  Oh, thanks, seagull.
[2003.42s -> 2005.66s]  And by the way,
[2005.66s -> 2007.66s]  I know you like the robe. I know you do.
[2009.66s -> 2012.60s]  But I, uh,
[2012.60s -> 2014.60s]  it's too hot up here to wear this 24-7.
[2014.60s -> 2016.60s]  I'll put it on at other times, okay?
[2016.60s -> 2018.60s]  I really have a huge bird shit on me.
[2020.60s -> 2025.85s]  Can I put this somewhere
[2025.85s -> 2027.85s]  that's way too hot to wear this?
[2027.85s -> 2030.15s]  Do you know how hot it is?
[2030.15s -> 2032.15s]  I can't put this on.
[2032.15s -> 2034.15s]  And by the way, these
[2034.15s -> 2036.15s]  don't fit. I was
[2036.15s -> 2038.15s]  so concerned that these were gonna get picked
[2038.15s -> 2040.15s]  because they don't fit. It was,
[2040.15s -> 2042.15s]  it's a disaster.
[2042.15s -> 2044.15s]  So I'm gonna be walking around like this is a diaper.
[2044.15s -> 2047.22s]  What do you mean, wear the robe or
[2047.22s -> 2051.26s]  no food? Wear the robe,
[2051.26s -> 2053.26s]  hell about it. I can't see that today
[2053.26s -> 2055.26s]  to take my glasses off. No, no robe,
[2055.26s -> 2061.85s]  no food. Fine.
[2061.85s -> 2063.85s]  Here.
[2063.85s -> 2067.56s]  Here's a souvenir.
[2067.56s -> 2069.56s]  Alright, I'll put the robe back on.
[2069.56s -> 2071.56s]  Uh, but if there's like an article written
[2071.56s -> 2073.56s]  later this afternoon about like
[2073.56s -> 2075.56s]  streamer dies of heatstroke on stream,
[2075.56s -> 2077.56s]  remember whose fault it was.
[2089.64s -> 2091.64s]  I guess I'll have a cookie.
[2091.64s -> 2095.54s]  Fresh baked cookies.
[2095.54s -> 2097.54s]  Fresh baked cookies from
[2097.54s -> 2099.54s]  eight days ago.
[2099.54s -> 2106.70s]  Pretty good.
[2106.70s -> 2109.77s]  It's not even good.
[2109.77s -> 2115.70s]  You're like, this is dad.
[2115.70s -> 2117.70s]  Like dad, you're having like a sleepover,
[2117.70s -> 2119.70s]  like you come up, it's like two o'clock
[2119.70s -> 2121.70s]  in the morning, you come out here, you're getting
[2121.70s -> 2123.70s]  a snack for you and your friends and I'm dad.
[2123.70s -> 2125.70s]  Like, oh, hey son.
[2125.70s -> 2127.70s]  What's going on in there?
[2127.70s -> 2129.70s]  You guys supposed to be asleep.
[2129.70s -> 2131.70s]  I keep hearing noises in there.
[2131.70s -> 2134.52s]  You gotta cut that out son.
[2134.52s -> 2138.23s]  I got a big thesis
[2138.23s -> 2140.23s]  coming up next Monday.
[2140.23s -> 2143.74s]  Do you want some milk?
[2143.74s -> 2148.97s]  Of course you don't.
[2148.97s -> 2150.97s]  That was a good cookie.
[2150.97s -> 2152.97s]  I love how cookie equals entire meal.
[2152.97s -> 2156.42s]  One thing I had to make
[2156.42s -> 2158.42s]  really clear is eating
[2158.42s -> 2160.42s]  on this stream. Eating on
[2160.42s -> 2163.11s]  stream, right?
[2163.11s -> 2165.11s]  I can't eat like a full dinner every day.
[2165.11s -> 2167.11s]  I can't, what, you want me to eat like
[2167.11s -> 2169.11s]  a full plate of steak or something? No.
[2169.11s -> 2171.99s]  I'm gonna eat a cookie and I'm good.
[2171.99s -> 2173.99s]  And like I have to finish the cookie, right?
[2173.99s -> 2177.26s]  I can't just throw like a quarter
[2177.26s -> 2188.33s]  of a cookie away.
[2188.33s -> 2191.46s]  Give me a shower.
[2191.46s -> 2194.28s]  Wait, wait.
[2194.28s -> 2204.84s]  Let's go for a shower.
[2204.84s -> 2209.06s]  With my glasses on.
[2209.06s -> 2212.46s]  Hey, ask Reddit.
[2212.46s -> 2214.46s]  What's something you do
[2214.46s -> 2216.46s]  in the shower that like
[2216.46s -> 2218.46s]  people know and it's like we all know.
[2218.46s -> 2220.46s]  Oh man, I go in the shower with my glasses on all the time
[2220.46s -> 2222.46s]  and they fog up. Oh me too. Ten thousand up.
[2226.94s -> 2237.93s]  You know, I don't think
[2237.93s -> 2239.93s]  there'll ever be one stream
[2239.93s -> 2242.23s]  where we don't do like the fart is funny
[2242.23s -> 2244.66s]  joke. You know, I thought we could get
[2244.66s -> 2247.99s]  done. This is the third one.
[2247.99s -> 2251.77s]  This is day three.
[2251.77s -> 2254.01s]  But like, look, if it
[2254.01s -> 2256.01s]  gets bad, whatever.
[2256.01s -> 2258.01s]  How do I even describe, explain myself here?
[2260.01s -> 2275.35s]  At least I feel clean.
[2275.35s -> 2279.13s]  Oh, I need to go.
[2279.13s -> 2282.84s]  I want to go to my bed.
[2282.84s -> 2286.36s]  I want to go in my bed.
[2291.46s -> 2293.46s]  Oh, these stairs. I don't even want
[2293.46s -> 2296.28s]  stairs. I want a
[2296.28s -> 2298.28s]  flat house where I can walk around in.
[2298.28s -> 2307.10s]  Oh, this is going to be fun,
[2307.10s -> 2309.10s]  but I don't want to do it.
[2309.10s -> 2312.79s]  What's that? What's that?
[2312.79s -> 2314.03s]  What's that?
[2314.03s -> 2316.03s]  Sure about that at five dot com.
[2316.03s -> 2319.10s]  Sure about that at five dot com, official merchandise.
[2319.10s -> 2321.86s]  Don't go
[2321.86s -> 2327.42s]  and don't, don't go there.
[2327.42s -> 2331.26s]  Let me see if there are any butterflies.
[2331.26s -> 2335.36s]  Let me see if there are any butterflies.
[2338.11s -> 2341.18s]  Oh, look, there goes one.
[2341.18s -> 2343.18s]  Oh, wow.
[2345.18s -> 2347.81s]  This looks like I'm trapped in here.
[2349.30s -> 2351.30s]  Like, hey, excuse me. I'm locked in here.
[2351.30s -> 2354.12s]  Can somebody help me?
[2354.12s -> 2357.00s]  Can you catch me a butterfly?
[2357.00s -> 2359.00s]  I have to go outside.
[2359.00s -> 2361.50s]  I'm too tired.
[2361.50s -> 2363.50s]  I can't catch butterflies.
[2367.40s -> 2369.90s]  My robe got stuck.
[2369.90s -> 2371.90s]  Alright, I'll go catch butterflies.
[2371.90s -> 2375.61s]  Sleep would have been a great option.
[2380.01s -> 2385.26s]  You know, go to sleep.
[2385.26s -> 2387.56s]  But fine. I'll go and
[2387.56s -> 2389.56s]  catch a few butterflies. Like, I care. Whatever.
[2389.56s -> 2402.02s]  I can make it. I can make it.
[2402.02s -> 2404.78s]  I think I can make it. But no,
[2404.78s -> 2406.78s]  of course not.
[2406.78s -> 2408.78s]  I didn't even show you outside. I didn't even show you.
[2408.78s -> 2410.78s]  We can look at something else too. We can look at the pool.
[2410.78s -> 2422.30s]  I have a pool now.
[2422.30s -> 2424.30s]  I almost fell over. I had to just
[2424.30s -> 2428.46s]  ground myself for a second.
[2428.46s -> 2431.14s]  Otherwise, I would have puked.
[2431.14s -> 2433.58s]  We got a pool. And
[2433.58s -> 2435.58s]  oh, cool. Oh,
[2435.58s -> 2439.22s]  yay. Ow, arm.
[2439.22s -> 2443.82s]  Oh, butterflies.
[2443.82s -> 2445.82s]  Oh, my God.
[2445.82s -> 2447.82s]  Huge net for a butterfly.
[2447.82s -> 2450.18s]  What are we catching?
[2450.18s -> 2452.68s]  Mothra?
[2452.68s -> 2456.01s]  From fucking Godzilla?
[2456.01s -> 2458.01s]  Oh, I think I got one.
[2462.02s -> 2464.02s]  I didn't know that was still turned on.
[2464.02s -> 2466.02s]  Oh, cool. Butterflies.
[2466.02s -> 2468.02s]  What songs do butterflies like?
[2468.02s -> 2471.93s]  One bit me in the neck.
[2471.93s -> 2479.72s]  Ow.
[2479.72s -> 2481.72s]  That's a pool.
[2481.72s -> 2503.34s]  This is a fucking other one.
[2503.34s -> 2508.58s]  Big house. I gotta get to bed right now.
[2508.58s -> 2510.89s]  I'm so tired.
[2510.89s -> 2513.83s]  Just need one night's sleep of good
[2513.83s -> 2517.54s]  rest in a bed.
[2517.54s -> 2519.54s]  That's all I need. That's all I want.
[2519.54s -> 2522.81s]  Okay.
[2522.81s -> 2532.14s]  The bed is
[2532.14s -> 2534.14s]  calling me. It's screaming at me.
[2542.02s -> 2933.69s]  I feel great.
[2933.69s -> 2935.69s]  What a good night's sleep. Holy smokes.
[2935.69s -> 2940.58s]  Oh, man.
[2940.58s -> 2942.58s]  I feel like I could write a book. I feel like I could write a
[2942.58s -> 2944.58s]  play. I feel like I could write a novel. I feel like I could go for a jog.
[2944.58s -> 2946.58s]  Oh, I feel fucking incredible.
[2946.58s -> 2948.58s]  Damn what a good night's sleep can do
[2948.58s -> 2950.58s]  for you. And a good food.
[2950.58s -> 2952.58s]  All that good stuff.
[2952.58s -> 2954.58s]  It's coming off.
[2954.58s -> 2962.76s]  It's clipped into the microphone.
[2962.76s -> 2964.76s]  At some point, we're gonna have to
[2964.76s -> 2968.98s]  actually do something about this.
[2968.98s -> 2970.98s]  Oh, I feel good though.
[2970.98s -> 2976.10s]  What a day.
[2976.10s -> 2978.10s]  Projects. Mystery box.
[2978.10s -> 2980.41s]  What's in here? Why is there a mystery box
[2980.41s -> 2985.34s]  up here? Sounds like a pretty
[2985.34s -> 2990.14s]  good day to check the mail. I got up a little
[2990.14s -> 2994.36s]  too fast and I almost just burped.
[2994.36s -> 2996.36s]  I created a bunch of gas
[2996.36s -> 2998.36s]  when I just came up really quickly.
[2998.36s -> 3000.36s]  And yeah, I almost just burped on camera.
[3000.36s -> 3012.38s]  Let's check the mail.
[3012.38s -> 3014.38s]  I feel so good. I could probably even come out backwards.
[3014.38s -> 3018.71s]  I can.
[3018.71s -> 3020.71s]  Why don't we do it here too? Bet you I can come out backwards.
[3020.71s -> 3033.56s]  Oh, shit.
[3033.56s -> 3043.67s]  That's new, whatever it is.
[3043.67s -> 3045.67s]  There's a piece of mail in here.
[3045.67s -> 3047.67s]  It's probably one of these kids in the
[3047.67s -> 3050.04s]  neighborhood. What does it say?
[3050.04s -> 3055.93s]  It says, Jerma, thank you
[3055.93s -> 3057.93s]  for involving us in such a unique experience.
[3057.93s -> 3059.93s]  We have had the time of our lives.
[3059.93s -> 3061.93s]  The crew.
[3061.93s -> 3067.22s]  I actually wrote that.
[3067.22s -> 3069.22s]  I actually wrote that. That's actually really nice.
[3069.22s -> 3071.22s]  Without a crew like this,
[3071.22s -> 3073.22s]  this is not possible.
[3073.22s -> 3075.22s]  This is by far one of the coolest things I've ever done.
[3075.22s -> 3077.22s]  And by far some of the best people I've
[3077.22s -> 3079.22s]  ever worked with in my whole life. And I really mean
[3079.22s -> 3082.10s]  that. All of you.
[3082.10s -> 3084.34s]  There's tons of people back here, tons of people backstage.
[3084.34s -> 3086.34s]  You can't even see them.
[3086.34s -> 3089.29s]  But clean this shit up.
[3093.62s -> 3096.18s]  Oh, a unicorn.
[3096.18s -> 3101.28s]  Wow.
[3101.28s -> 3103.28s]  Oh, it's huge.
[3103.28s -> 3105.28s]  Oh, what? Oh, dude.
[3105.28s -> 3107.28s]  Stone cold.
[3107.28s -> 3111.89s]  Stunner.
[3111.89s -> 3113.89s]  Don't hurt him. Don't hurt him. I'm not. He's fine.
[3113.89s -> 3118.05s]  Pool.
[3118.05s -> 3121.12s]  I can't wait to potentially go swimming in
[3121.12s -> 3123.12s]  that pool with absolute
[3123.12s -> 3125.36s]  water in it. You know, fun
[3125.36s -> 3127.36s]  fact for those of you behind the scenes stuff.
[3127.36s -> 3129.36s]  There's supposed to be water in there.
[3129.36s -> 3131.36s]  It's supposed to be a full pool. But last minute
[3131.36s -> 3133.36s]  we decided,
[3133.36s -> 3135.36s]  what an absolute dangerous hazard
[3135.36s -> 3137.36s]  considering there is a transformer
[3137.36s -> 3139.36s]  right there.
[3149.14s -> 3158.74s]  I love it though. I do feel
[3158.74s -> 3160.74s]  good though. This is a good day.
[3163.94s -> 3171.94s]  Go to work. You got it.
[3171.94s -> 3178.32s]  I'm in such a good mood.
[3178.32s -> 3180.32s]  Hey, can you queue up? Can you queue up like
[3180.32s -> 3182.32s]  somebody gets like fucking speared sound?
[3182.32s -> 3184.62s]  Can you queue up like somebody gets like
[3184.62s -> 3186.62s]  shing like speared sound?
[3186.62s -> 3188.62s]  Could you get that right now?
[3188.62s -> 3192.08s]  Okay. I want like a
[3192.08s -> 3194.08s]  skewed up spear sound. Somebody gets hit with a spear and they get like
[3194.08s -> 3197.73s]  ugh. I know.
[3197.73s -> 3199.73s]  Hold on. I'll be right there.
[3199.73s -> 3202.22s]  Hey.
[3202.22s -> 3204.22s]  Hey, thanks a lot to the crew.
[3212.67s -> 3440.75s]  I'm coming. Thank you. Eventually I will get a car
[3440.75s -> 3443.12s]  I promise. One day. I don't know when.
[3443.12s -> 3455.46s]  Thanks for the ride.
[3455.46s -> 3458.53s]  Oh shit. I hit somebody.
[3458.53s -> 3460.53s]  Oh my god. I actually hit somebody with the fucking
[3460.53s -> 3462.70s]  javelin. Are you all right?
[3462.70s -> 3465.46s]  I mean I threw it as hard as I
[3465.46s -> 3467.46s]  could. I didn't know you were going to be that far away.
[3467.46s -> 3470.70s]  Is he all right?
[3470.70s -> 3473.01s]  Is he okay?
[3473.01s -> 3475.01s]  I see a lot of blood coming out of here.
[3475.01s -> 3477.01s]  It's like profusely.
[3477.01s -> 3479.38s]  What if we get medical on him?
[3479.38s -> 3481.62s]  Is he okay?
[3481.62s -> 3484.37s]  Okay. Why would you stand
[3484.37s -> 3488.72s]  in the way? I mean I knew I had a good arm
[3488.72s -> 3490.72s]  but I'm cheating.
[3490.72s -> 3493.79s]  You know what I mean?
[3493.79s -> 3495.79s]  That's a classic fucking comedy joke.
[3495.79s -> 3498.66s]  All right.
[3498.66s -> 3500.66s]  That was a good day at work.
[3500.66s -> 3503.15s]  I am kind of gross.
[3503.15s -> 3505.15s]  I mean look. I've got a pool back here.
[3505.15s -> 3508.93s]  I don't even need your choice.
[3508.93s -> 3510.93s]  I want to go in the pool.
[3510.93s -> 3513.62s]  Look. We got it out here. I'm going to use it.
[3513.62s -> 3517.58s]  It's been a long day at work.
[3517.58s -> 3520.14s]  I'm going to get in the pool.
[3520.14s -> 3524.30s]  Just turn it off. Otherwise I fucking won't
[3524.30s -> 3528.85s]  stop touching it.
[3528.85s -> 3532.62s]  Okay. I can wear
[3532.62s -> 3535.18s]  the same clothes. It doesn't matter.
[3535.18s -> 3540.22s]  Cold. Cold.
[3540.22s -> 3542.46s]  That's the thing. You just got to go right in.
[3542.46s -> 3544.83s]  Okay. I'm just going in.
[3544.83s -> 3551.02s]  That feels good.
[3551.02s -> 3556.90s]  Oh.
[3556.90s -> 3563.81s]  Muglerberry do one of these?
[3563.81s -> 3569.10s]  I think so.
[3569.10s -> 3576.06s]  That feels good.
[3576.06s -> 3580.98s]  You know
[3580.98s -> 3582.98s]  something about cold water
[3582.98s -> 3584.98s]  that just really gets into your
[3584.98s -> 3586.98s]  head. It opens up your blood vessels
[3586.98s -> 3588.98s]  or closes them. I don't know.
[3588.98s -> 3590.98s]  Either one of those two things. It does one of them.
[3590.98s -> 3599.02s]  All right.
[3599.02s -> 3635.60s]  What? What happened?
[3635.60s -> 3637.60s]  I feel like I was still alive but something happened there.
[3637.60s -> 3640.03s]  I feel like
[3640.03s -> 3646.69s]  that was a long day at work. That was really weird.
[3646.69s -> 3648.93s]  I kind of just
[3648.93s -> 3651.49s]  felt like I stopped my head.
[3651.49s -> 3653.49s]  It was like a split second. My head felt like
[3653.49s -> 3656.11s]  it was
[3656.11s -> 3658.11s]  my head froze but it was only
[3658.11s -> 3660.61s]  a second. I don't know.
[3660.61s -> 3665.78s]  Where's the ladder?
[3665.78s -> 3669.62s]  What? I'm actually having fun though.
[3669.62s -> 3671.62s]  I'm having a fun time. What happened to the ladder?
[3671.62s -> 3675.39s]  Where's the
[3675.39s -> 3684.21s]  ladder?
[3684.21s -> 3686.21s]  Where's the ladder?
[3686.21s -> 3688.58s]  I have to get out of the pool.
[3688.58s -> 3690.58s]  I don't want to be in here all day.
[3690.58s -> 3693.71s]  I've got shit to do.
[3693.71s -> 3696.02s]  Help! Somebody help me!
[3696.02s -> 3701.01s]  Somebody help me!
[3701.01s -> 3703.63s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Come back!
[3703.63s -> 3705.63s]  Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
[3705.63s -> 3707.63s]  Get in the pool! Get in the pool!
[3707.63s -> 3709.87s]  Get in the pool and help me! Get in the pool!
[3709.87s -> 3711.87s]  Get in the pool!
[3711.87s -> 3714.43s]  There's someone in the pool that needs help.
[3714.43s -> 3716.86s]  I think they took the ladder over there.
[3716.86s -> 3718.86s]  You idiot AI piece of shit!
[3718.86s -> 3722.83s]  Hey! Hey!
[3722.83s -> 3726.42s]  Don't eat anything!
[3726.42s -> 3730.96s]  Don't eat anything!
[3730.96s -> 3733.39s]  What's he doing?
[3733.39s -> 3736.78s]  Is he in my bathroom?
[3736.78s -> 3738.78s]  He's still drinking beer! I can tell!
[3738.78s -> 3740.78s]  That's all people do in my house is drink
[3740.78s -> 3744.24s]  beer out of the fridge!
[3744.24s -> 3746.24s]  Put the ladder back, put the ladder back. You can put the ladder back if you want.
[3746.24s -> 3748.67s]  You should put the ladder back.
[3748.67s -> 3752.96s]  I want to get out of the pool!
[3752.96s -> 3755.71s]  I want to get out of the pool!
[3755.71s -> 3759.68s]  I want to get out of the pool!
[3759.68s -> 3772.34s]  Put the ladder back.
[3793.84s -> 3803.62s]  Well, has someone
[3803.62s -> 3805.62s]  gone for a little swim
[3805.62s -> 3807.62s]  without his
[3807.62s -> 3809.62s]  floaties?
[3809.62s -> 3811.62s]  It's me, your old friend Death
[3811.62s -> 3813.62s]  who puts the fun
[3813.62s -> 3816.05s]  in funeral. Come on
[3816.05s -> 3825.06s]  now. It's time.
[3827.06s -> 3829.06s]  Oh yes.
[3829.06s -> 3831.06s]  It's time for the midnight
[3831.06s -> 3833.06s]  train to the long farewell.
[3833.06s -> 3835.06s]  No! No! What?
[3835.06s -> 3837.06s]  You killed me!
[3837.06s -> 3839.06s]  Why did you take the ladder out?
[3839.06s -> 3841.06s]  It's a funny
[3841.06s -> 3843.06s]  joke, isn't it? Until it's dead.
[3843.06s -> 3845.06s]  Are you blaming someone else
[3845.06s -> 3847.06s]  when you decided to get in without
[3847.06s -> 3849.06s]  a life jacket?
[3849.06s -> 3852.83s]  You're right.
[3852.83s -> 3854.83s]  Okay. Am I dead?
[3854.83s -> 3856.83s]  Am I dead now?
[3856.83s -> 3858.83s]  Oh, you're very, very dead.
[3858.83s -> 3860.83s]  Oh, wait a minute. I could have just gone like
[3860.83s -> 3862.83s]  this.
[3862.83s -> 3867.38s]  Oh!
[3867.38s -> 3869.38s]  Unfortunately, no givesies
[3869.38s -> 3872.90s]  backsies.
[3872.90s -> 3874.90s]  Someone! Have you made
[3874.90s -> 3876.90s]  all of your preparations? I have
[3876.90s -> 3878.90s]  and I just...
[3878.90s -> 3881.46s]  You look
[3881.46s -> 3883.46s]  wonderful today.
[3883.46s -> 3885.70s]  Can I just tell you that?
[3885.70s -> 3887.70s]  The scythe, the uniform,
[3887.70s -> 3889.70s]  something about the way, the mysterious,
[3889.70s -> 3891.70s]  the dark, mysterious
[3891.70s -> 3893.70s]  stranger. You know, usually
[3893.70s -> 3895.70s]  when people flirt with Death, it's something
[3895.70s -> 3897.70s]  simpler like blowfish sushi.
[3897.70s -> 3899.70s]  Right. This is a bit complicated.
[3899.70s -> 3901.70s]  Are you...
[3901.70s -> 3903.70s]  Do you mean it when you say that?
[3903.70s -> 3905.70s]  Or are you saying that because you saw me?
[3905.70s -> 3907.70s]  I mean, I mean it. I do.
[3907.70s -> 3909.70s]  I think that I...
[3909.70s -> 3911.70s]  Would you like to come inside? Maybe?
[3911.70s -> 3913.70s]  Do we have to go immediately
[3913.70s -> 3915.70s]  or can we have a drink? Can we hang out?
[3915.70s -> 3917.70s]  This is kind of... Listen,
[3917.70s -> 3919.70s]  I have a hot dog eating contest and I've got
[3919.70s -> 3921.70s]  three souls to take in about 20 minutes.
[3921.70s -> 3923.70s]  Okay.
[3923.70s -> 3925.70s]  It's unconventional, but this once.
[3925.70s -> 3927.70s]  I'll allow it.
[3927.70s -> 3929.70s]  Okay, great. Come on in.
[3929.70s -> 3931.70s]  I feel... Is that normal?
[3931.70s -> 3933.70s]  Should I be doing that? That is normal.
[3936.06s -> 3938.06s]  Usually it's a bit more crying,
[3938.06s -> 3941.84s]  screaming.
[3941.84s -> 3943.84s]  I've been crying, it feels like for fucking three days,
[3943.84s -> 3945.84s]  Death. That's alright.
[3945.84s -> 3947.84s]  Time to see your uncle Ted.
[3947.84s -> 3949.84s]  Isn't that fun after all?
[3949.84s -> 3951.84s]  I didn't even know that.
[3951.84s -> 3953.84s]  I thought he was dead like a year.
[3953.84s -> 3955.84s]  I already got a spot picked out for you.
[3955.84s -> 3957.84s]  Okay.
[3957.84s -> 3959.84s]  Well, I really do think you're
[3959.84s -> 3961.84s]  a very, very, very handsome, Death.
[3961.84s -> 3963.84s]  Oh, stop.
[3963.84s -> 3965.84s]  Stop. You don't mean that.
[3965.84s -> 3967.84s]  I do. I do mean it.
[3967.84s -> 3970.34s]  Come on in here.
[3970.34s -> 3974.11s]  Why is he in here?
[3977.42s -> 3979.42s]  Hey, I just want to let you know
[3979.42s -> 3981.42s]  it's probably...
[3981.42s -> 3983.42s]  Thanks for the help, by the way.
[3983.42s -> 3985.73s]  You did a great job,
[3985.73s -> 3987.73s]  by the way.
[3987.73s -> 3989.73s]  Officer of the law, of the court.
[3989.73s -> 3991.73s]  Keep doing as best as you can.
[3991.73s -> 3994.35s]  Watching TV.
[3994.35s -> 3996.35s]  Making good friends in the neighborhood,
[3996.35s -> 3998.35s]  are we? Yes, we are making
[3998.35s -> 4000.35s]  very good friends in the neighborhood.
[4000.35s -> 4002.35s]  That's a garage back there.
[4002.35s -> 4004.78s]  Sorry, I don't want you to see my garage.
[4004.78s -> 4006.78s]  It's full of filthy, filthy stuff.
[4006.78s -> 4008.78s]  Are you trying to waste my time?
[4008.78s -> 4010.78s]  Filthy thing. Come on up here
[4010.78s -> 4012.78s]  into my room, Death.
[4012.78s -> 4014.78s]  I'll show you my poster. I've got some pretty cool posters.
[4014.78s -> 4018.24s]  Watch your step, though.
[4018.24s -> 4020.24s]  Wow, a little dark back here.
[4020.24s -> 4022.24s]  It is kind of dark, yeah. I've got to get some lighting.
[4022.24s -> 4024.61s]  I just moved in.
[4024.61s -> 4026.61s]  I just moved in about today,
[4026.61s -> 4028.61s]  yesterday, actually.
[4028.61s -> 4030.61s]  Boy, quick turnaround, huh?
[4030.61s -> 4032.61s]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[4032.61s -> 4034.61s]  You all right?
[4034.61s -> 4037.36s]  I can tell I'm going to be making more than one visit here.
[4037.36s -> 4039.36s]  An entire stairwell
[4039.36s -> 4041.79s]  and no lights.
[4041.79s -> 4043.79s]  I'm Death, of course I'm all right.
[4043.79s -> 4045.97s]  He doesn't even feel pain. He's Death.
[4045.97s -> 4048.34s]  How about this room? You like it?
[4048.34s -> 4053.33s]  It's a little minimalist.
[4053.33s -> 4055.33s]  Well, it's
[4055.33s -> 4057.33s]  going to be upgraded.
[4057.33s -> 4059.33s]  It's going to be upgraded really soon.
[4059.33s -> 4061.33s]  Probably in the near future.
[4061.33s -> 4063.33s]  Interesting decor choice.
[4063.33s -> 4065.33s]  Yes, if you'd like to look at the bedroom, it's up here.
[4065.33s -> 4067.33s]  I can give you a full tour.
[4067.33s -> 4069.33s]  It's a work in progress.
[4069.33s -> 4071.33s]  It's a work in progress.
[4071.33s -> 4073.63s]  So in here,
[4073.63s -> 4075.63s]  I've got two beds for fun.
[4075.63s -> 4077.63s]  I don't know. They decided to give it to me.
[4077.63s -> 4080.06s]  So what was your last
[4080.06s -> 4082.06s]  where were you before this?
[4082.06s -> 4084.06s]  Right before this? Yeah, like right before you
[4084.06s -> 4086.06s]  came in and got me. Carnival ride
[4086.06s -> 4088.06s]  accident Kentucky.
[4088.06s -> 4090.06s]  One of those small
[4090.06s -> 4092.06s]  cars roller coasters.
[4092.06s -> 4094.06s]  They tried to fit four people into one.
[4094.06s -> 4096.06s]  You know how it goes.
[4096.06s -> 4098.06s]  That's unfortunate. Two people choked on
[4098.06s -> 4100.06s]  churros.
[4100.06s -> 4102.06s]  In the audience? Oh, yes.
[4102.06s -> 4104.06s]  Dead right away. I feel like
[4104.06s -> 4106.06s]  you've got a lot of places to be.
[4106.06s -> 4108.06s]  Oh, I've got appointments all
[4108.06s -> 4110.06s]  day. So no days off
[4110.06s -> 4112.06s]  for death. How many people die a day?
[4112.06s -> 4114.06s]  How many people die a day? That's classified.
[4114.06s -> 4116.06s]  Okay, it's probably
[4116.06s -> 4118.06s]  I'm going to give you a number. Is it more or less than
[4118.06s -> 4120.06s]  100,000? Yes.
[4120.06s -> 4122.06s]  It is more or less than that number.
[4122.06s -> 4124.06s]  Okay, so
[4124.06s -> 4126.06s]  outside you can see we've got a pretty good view.
[4126.06s -> 4128.06s]  A beautiful view of the outside. Oh, lovely.
[4128.06s -> 4130.06s]  Yeah, it's pretty nice. Are all those
[4130.06s -> 4132.06s]  butterflies common in this area?
[4132.06s -> 4134.06s]  They're actually huge. I don't know, but you can make yourself comfortable.
[4134.06s -> 4136.06s]  Do you want a snack or something?
[4136.06s -> 4138.06s]  There's plenty of room to hang out if you want to.
[4138.06s -> 4140.06s]  Snack? I'm actually, I mean, I'm just trying
[4140.06s -> 4142.06s]  to. When do we go
[4142.06s -> 4144.06s]  to the other side? Oh,
[4144.06s -> 4146.06s]  very soon. Very soon.
[4146.06s -> 4148.06s]  Very soon. Okay, well, I'm
[4148.06s -> 4154.34s]  it's a what scene?
[4154.34s -> 4158.50s]  It's the what scene.
[4158.50s -> 4160.50s]  You said a W word.
[4160.50s -> 4163.18s]  W word?
[4165.18s -> 4167.18s]  Oh, okay.
[4167.18s -> 4169.18s]  Death,
[4169.18s -> 4171.18s]  I don't know how you feel about potentially
[4171.18s -> 4173.18s]  have you heard the word, word woohoo
[4173.18s -> 4175.18s]  before? Woohoo.
[4175.18s -> 4177.18s]  You and I are potentially on a date
[4177.18s -> 4179.18s]  here. I can't say that woohoo
[4179.18s -> 4181.18s]  is a part of my normal vocabulary
[4181.18s -> 4183.18s]  as death. Not a lot of
[4183.18s -> 4185.18s]  woohoo in the underworld.
[4185.18s -> 4187.18s]  It's more like
[4187.18s -> 4191.73s]  ah! Generally
[4191.73s -> 4193.73s]  speaking. Oh,
[4193.73s -> 4195.73s]  so would you like to spend an evening together?
[4195.73s -> 4197.73s]  Is what I'm asking.
[4197.73s -> 4199.73s]  Would you
[4199.73s -> 4201.73s]  still respect me if I said yes?
[4201.73s -> 4203.73s]  Absolutely.
[4203.73s -> 4209.10s]  I guess we're doing this.
[4209.10s -> 4211.10s]  Shall we?
[4211.10s -> 4213.10s]  Allow me.
[4217.58s -> 4219.58s]  I'm going to put the robe on.
[4219.58s -> 4221.58s]  I'm going to show you the time
[4221.58s -> 4223.58s]  of your life.
[4223.58s -> 4225.58s]  Okay, that sounds good to me.
[4225.58s -> 4227.58s]  So how is this
[4227.58s -> 4229.58s]  going to work? You're not going to, do I like
[4229.58s -> 4231.58s]  die? Am I dead?
[4231.58s -> 4233.58s]  I'm going to tell you right now it's something you'll
[4233.58s -> 4235.58s]  never forget. Okay,
[4235.58s -> 4237.58s]  alright, I'm into this too.
[4237.58s -> 4239.58s]  Death, you know
[4239.58s -> 4241.58s]  I've been known to
[4241.58s -> 4243.58s]  go for at least two to three minutes.
[4243.58s -> 4245.58s]  Wow, record breaker.
[4245.58s -> 4248.91s]  This is nice.
[4248.91s -> 4253.90s]  This is nice.
[4253.90s -> 4255.90s]  Okay, let's get
[4255.90s -> 4258.53s]  together.
[4258.53s -> 4260.53s]  Come on.
[4260.53s -> 4262.53s]  Dude, be shy.
[4266.53s -> 4272.29s]  Somebody's at the door.
[4272.29s -> 4274.29s]  Somebody's at the door.
[4274.29s -> 4276.29s]  Hold on,
[4276.29s -> 4278.29s]  somebody's at the door.
[4278.29s -> 4280.29s]  That was wonderful.
[4280.29s -> 4282.29s]  Stay up here.
[4282.29s -> 4284.29s]  Stay up here.
[4284.29s -> 4286.29s]  Don't make yourself a known enemy.
[4286.29s -> 4291.86s]  I can't go back to bed.
[4291.86s -> 4296.08s]  Just
[4296.08s -> 4298.08s]  get under there.
[4298.08s -> 4300.08s]  Just stay under there. Just cover yourself up.
[4300.08s -> 4302.08s]  Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[4302.08s -> 4307.20s]  Just cover yourself.
[4307.20s -> 4309.81s]  I'm in the bedroom.
[4309.81s -> 4313.01s]  Who is it?
[4313.01s -> 4315.25s]  Jerma, I'm in the bedroom.
[4315.25s -> 4317.55s]  Oh, um,
[4317.55s -> 4319.55s]  I guess, okay.
[4319.55s -> 4323.65s]  You come up, it's through the hallway.
[4323.65s -> 4325.65s]  Hey, Amelia.
[4325.65s -> 4327.65s]  Sorry.
[4327.65s -> 4329.65s]  What? Amelia,
[4329.65s -> 4331.65s]  how are you? Who is that?
[4331.65s -> 4334.14s]  That's just a bunch of pillows.
[4334.14s -> 4336.14s]  That's just a bunch of pillows.
[4336.14s -> 4338.14s]  It's a collection of moving
[4338.14s -> 4340.14s]  sentient pillows.
[4340.14s -> 4342.14s]  This is a standing pillow now.
[4342.14s -> 4344.14s]  Am I meant to believe
[4344.14s -> 4346.14s]  because I'm a stupid maid that this is a sentient
[4346.14s -> 4348.14s]  pillow that's dead?
[4348.14s -> 4350.14s]  No, no, no, no.
[4350.14s -> 4352.14s]  Oh, he's got a side. Dad, what are you doing about that?
[4352.14s -> 4354.14s]  He's got a side. He's got your side.
[4354.14s -> 4356.14s]  Why did you stand me up on our date
[4356.14s -> 4358.14s]  and now this?
[4358.14s -> 4360.14s]  Look, you have no idea. My life has been an absolute
[4360.14s -> 4362.14s]  train ride. People come to the house, organ players.
[4362.14s -> 4364.14s]  I've had like police here three times.
[4364.14s -> 4366.14s]  A police officer was here like an hour ago just drinking on my couch.
[4366.14s -> 4368.14s]  This sounds really tough for you
[4368.14s -> 4370.14s]  that someone was drinking on your couch.
[4370.14s -> 4372.14s]  No, you don't understand. It wasn't even
[4372.14s -> 4374.14s]  my decision. It was easy for me to get
[4374.14s -> 4376.14s]  stood up and I can't believe this.
[4376.14s -> 4378.14s]  You can take this. You can take him.
[4378.14s -> 4380.14s]  You shitter. No, no.
[4380.14s -> 4382.14s]  I hope it was nice. Amelia, just wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4382.14s -> 4384.14s]  No, no.
[4384.14s -> 4386.14s]  You missed your chance.
[4386.14s -> 4388.14s]  You don't know how high
[4388.14s -> 4390.45s]  I can fly.
[4394.48s -> 4398.26s]  How high?
[4398.26s -> 4400.50s]  Amelia! This has been great.
[4400.50s -> 4402.50s]  It's just a little tense for me.
[4402.50s -> 4404.50s]  I've got that hot dog eating contest. Listen,
[4404.50s -> 4406.50s]  I'm just gonna go.
[4406.50s -> 4408.50s]  You don't call me, I'll call you.
[4408.50s -> 4410.50s]  Okay?
[4410.50s -> 4412.50s]  Just gotta go. Wish I could talk.
[4412.50s -> 4414.50s]  Have to go.
[4414.50s -> 4416.50s]  So nice. I actually don't want you to call me.
[4416.50s -> 4418.50s]  I want you to lose my number because I don't want to hear from you because that means a bad thing.
[4418.50s -> 4420.50s]  Oh, don't worry. I'll come calling.
[4420.50s -> 4422.50s]  You just won't know when.
[4422.50s -> 4425.42s]  Jesus.
[4425.42s -> 4428.37s]  I got my life back.
[4428.37s -> 4430.61s]  I feel like
[4430.61s -> 4432.61s]  I've had a big life, but I gotta
[4432.61s -> 4436.45s]  hold on. I need to
[4436.45s -> 4438.45s]  Amelia, god damn it.
[4438.45s -> 4440.45s]  I didn't want to stand anybody up.
[4440.45s -> 4442.45s]  It's not even my decision if I stand
[4442.45s -> 4444.45s]  somebody up or not. Did you understand?
[4446.75s -> 4448.75s]  It's not my choice if somebody's
[4448.75s -> 4452.53s]  Amelia!
[4452.53s -> 4454.53s]  Amelia!
[4454.53s -> 4458.29s]  Just wait. Amelia,
[4458.29s -> 4460.29s]  hold on. It takes 30 seconds to come down
[4460.29s -> 4464.26s]  the stairs. Amelia!
[4464.26s -> 4471.09s]  Oh, no. Amelia!
[4471.09s -> 4473.95s]  Oh, crap.
[4473.95s -> 4475.95s]  Oh, crap.
[4475.95s -> 4481.97s]  Amelia! Oh, that was a voice
[4481.97s -> 4483.97s]  crack and it was bad.
[4483.97s -> 4486.14s]  It was the worst one I've ever done.
[4486.14s -> 4494.46s]  What a disaster.
[4494.46s -> 4504.56s]  What a day. Oh, right. I turned it
[4504.56s -> 4508.85s]  off. Right. That's not, I didn't
[4508.85s -> 4513.58s]  want that to happen.
[4513.58s -> 4528.48s]  Damn. What a wild day.
[4528.48s -> 4531.47s]  Well, here's
[4531.47s -> 4533.47s]  something for you guys.
[4533.47s -> 4535.47s]  If you kill me,
[4535.47s -> 4537.47s]  you need to be ready for the consequences.
[4537.47s -> 4560.06s]  Catch butterflies!
[4560.06s -> 4562.06s]  I don't even know how I threw it at somebody.
[4562.06s -> 4564.06s]  Is he all right? Can I get it from him? Can I get it from
[4564.06s -> 4566.06s]  him?
[4566.06s -> 4568.06s]  Can you give me the thing that I threw at the crew
[4568.06s -> 4570.06s]  member? Yeah, just toss it over here.
[4570.06s -> 4572.06s]  Yeah. Thank you.
[4572.06s -> 4574.06s]  Thanks, appreciate it.
[4574.06s -> 4580.06s]  Catch butterflies.
[4580.06s -> 4587.62s]  I'm falling full. I can't get out of there.
[4587.62s -> 4595.54s]  Did I get any? I don't
[4595.54s -> 4597.54s]  even know. I don't even like everything. I don't know what they look like.
[4597.54s -> 4605.66s]  I'm so tired.
[4605.66s -> 4607.66s]  Please, send me to bed.
[4607.66s -> 4617.76s]  Thank you.
[4617.76s -> 4619.76s]  It's so far away.
[4619.76s -> 4622.06s]  It's so far away.
[4622.06s -> 4624.06s]  It's so far away. Why do I have such a big house?
[4624.06s -> 4626.06s]  It's too far away.
[4626.06s -> 4634.43s]  I can
[4634.43s -> 4636.74s]  get there. I can get
[4636.74s -> 4643.46s]  there. Let's go upstairs.
[4643.46s -> 4645.76s]  Okay. Two, three,
[4645.76s -> 4647.76s]  four, five. I can't.
[4647.76s -> 5149.18s]  Whoa. Oh, that's been
[5149.18s -> 5151.94s]  digging into my neck. Oh,
[5151.94s -> 5153.94s]  it's been digging into my neck the whole
[5153.94s -> 5156.62s]  night. Ah, one of these
[5156.62s -> 5159.12s]  staircase things. Oh,
[5159.12s -> 5165.76s]  ugh. There's this like
[5165.76s -> 5167.76s]  deep purple blood here.
[5167.76s -> 5169.76s]  What is that?
[5169.76s -> 5172.83s]  Why is it like purple blood?
[5172.83s -> 5179.79s]  Ugh. My glasses all in all night.
[5179.79s -> 5183.55s]  Ow.
[5183.55s -> 5185.55s]  I'm going to have this permanent just kink in
[5185.55s -> 5191.63s]  my neck. And remember,
[5191.63s -> 5196.37s]  Germanite85.com.
[5196.37s -> 5198.99s]  If you want to get your visit,
[5198.99s -> 5200.99s]  I don't even care. I fucking tear it down.
[5200.99s -> 5202.99s]  I don't even want it. I'm going to
[5202.99s -> 5206.88s]  want it.
[5206.88s -> 5208.88s]  You can decide for yourself if you want to go to
[5208.88s -> 5210.88s]  Germanite85.com and get merchandise
[5210.88s -> 5212.88s]  especially specifically for this show.
[5212.88s -> 5222.29s]  I feel awful.
[5222.29s -> 5229.01s]  I just feel like this sucks.
[5229.01s -> 5233.68s]  Oh, yes.
[5233.68s -> 5239.81s]  Oh, it's a Dachshund.
[5239.81s -> 5242.94s]  Oh, it's Otto.
[5242.94s -> 5246.14s]  It's an Otto.
[5246.14s -> 5248.70s]  Oh,
[5248.70s -> 5251.52s]  and it's my ladybug friend from
[5251.52s -> 5253.82s]  the first, from two
[5253.82s -> 5256.38s]  weeks ago. I'm going to say
[5256.38s -> 5258.38s]  first stream because then we're going to
[5258.38s -> 5261.14s]  have continuity.
[5261.14s -> 5263.14s]  Oh, I love them.
[5263.14s -> 5265.14s]  I actually love them. And wait, is this one of those
[5265.14s -> 5268.27s]  things I can go like this?
[5268.27s -> 5270.27s]  What? Holy shit. Get this on fucking
[5270.27s -> 5274.75s]  camcorder.
[5274.75s -> 5278.53s]  Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?
[5278.53s -> 5281.28s]  Are you kidding me?
[5281.28s -> 5283.58s]  I love them. They're fantastic.
[5283.58s -> 5285.58s]  Oh, they're so cool.
[5285.58s -> 5287.58s]  They're going to go
[5287.58s -> 5290.27s]  in my bed. They're going to go
[5290.27s -> 5293.71s]  in my bed. In my bed.
[5293.71s -> 5296.40s]  I don't want to go too far.
[5296.40s -> 5301.07s]  This one. Wait, look at this.
[5301.07s -> 5306.00s]  It's a magic trick for you.
[5322.86s -> 5324.86s]  I'm starting to feel that up here in the throat. I have to pee
[5324.86s -> 5334.53s]  so bad.
[5334.53s -> 5336.53s]  I'm going to pee with or without the robe.
[5336.53s -> 5339.92s]  I'm just tell...
[5339.92s -> 5341.92s]  Look, I'm just saying.
[5343.92s -> 5346.74s]  I'm just saying.
[5346.74s -> 5350.83s]  Hot dog. I'm just saying.
[5350.83s -> 5359.54s]  If it allows me to go to the bathroom, I'll
[5359.54s -> 5361.54s]  put it on. Hold on.
[5361.54s -> 5366.66s]  I'm going to go down the stairs.
[5366.66s -> 5368.66s]  I'll put it on. It'll be on by the time
[5368.66s -> 5370.66s]  you see me next, I promise.
[5376.21s -> 5378.21s]  Put the robe on. Get heat stroke.
[5378.21s -> 5381.47s]  We want robe, but no bathroom.
[5381.47s -> 5385.76s]  Wrong door.
[5385.76s -> 5391.33s]  This is the one I'm supposed to go in.
[5391.33s -> 5395.49s]  Okay.
[5395.49s -> 5413.15s]  Who is calling me?
[5415.46s -> 5417.46s]  Who is calling my phone?
[5417.46s -> 5419.46s]  Oh my god.
[5419.46s -> 5431.17s]  Hey, this is Jason again calling
[5431.17s -> 5433.17s]  from Dealer Warranty Services,
[5433.17s -> 5435.17s]  licensed representatives of
[5435.17s -> 5437.17s]  Car Extended Vehicle Purchase
[5437.17s -> 5439.17s]  Points LLC calling.
[5439.17s -> 5441.17s]  Looks like you've
[5441.17s -> 5443.17s]  been dodging a couple of my phone calls.
[5443.17s -> 5445.17s]  We sent you a bunch of things in the mail,
[5445.17s -> 5447.17s]  a couple emails,
[5447.17s -> 5449.17s]  a couple fax machines,
[5449.17s -> 5451.17s]  even got your grandma in on the thing.
[5451.17s -> 5453.17s]  But for some reason, you just don't
[5453.17s -> 5455.17s]  seem to want to get back to me about
[5455.17s -> 5457.17s]  your vehicle's extended warranty.
[5457.17s -> 5459.17s]  Are you trying to drive
[5459.17s -> 5461.17s]  unsafe?
[5461.17s -> 5463.17s]  Do you want your car
[5463.17s -> 5465.17s]  to explode?
[5465.17s -> 5467.17s]  At this point, I'm starting to
[5467.17s -> 5469.17s]  be a little concerned.
[5469.17s -> 5473.38s]  You know, phone calls
[5473.38s -> 5475.38s]  are starting to become like
[5475.38s -> 5477.38s]  email. Have you noticed that?
[5477.38s -> 5479.62s]  When was the last time you answered the telephone?
[5479.62s -> 5481.62s]  If mom wasn't
[5481.62s -> 5483.62s]  the contact that came up.
[5483.62s -> 5487.20s]  I have not answered my actual
[5487.20s -> 5489.20s]  cell phone unless
[5489.20s -> 5491.20s]  MOM is on the goddamn
[5491.20s -> 5493.50s]  fucking thing.
[5493.50s -> 5495.50s]  It's becoming spam email now.
[5495.50s -> 5497.50s]  Nobody answers their phone, nobody checks their
[5497.50s -> 5499.50s]  email. How do we communicate with anybody?
[5499.50s -> 5513.82s]  I wasn't done.
[5513.82s -> 5526.10s]  I wasn't done. Hold on.
[5528.10s -> 5530.27s]  I'm gonna need a little more than that.
[5530.27s -> 5532.27s]  I'm gonna need a little more than that.
[5534.58s -> 5536.58s]  I'm gonna need a little bit more than that.
[5553.46s -> 5558.45s]  It's in. Yes.
[5558.45s -> 5570.21s]  Show up!
[5570.21s -> 5573.02s]  This is fucked.
[5573.02s -> 5575.02s]  This is from screaming for three straight days.
[5575.02s -> 5580.78s]  Show up!
[5582.78s -> 5592.11s]  Get those bars
[5592.11s -> 5594.93s]  up. Otherwise, I'm
[5594.93s -> 5598.96s]  gonna be in trouble.
[5598.96s -> 5600.96s]  Glasses. Reddit.
[5600.96s -> 5603.20s]  Ten thousand.
[5603.20s -> 5607.04s]  Upload.
[5615.86s -> 5617.86s]  And you know the pose we're doing.
[5617.86s -> 5622.70s]  Told you. Told you.
[5622.70s -> 5625.65s]  I'm hungry. Very hungry.
[5625.65s -> 5630.45s]  Exceptional. I gotta clean this up.
[5630.45s -> 5632.45s]  What happened here?
[5632.45s -> 5637.25s]  Look at this. What a mess.
[5637.25s -> 5641.34s]  This looks awesome.
[5641.34s -> 5643.34s]  Awesome? Looks awful.
[5643.34s -> 5646.16s]  Make food
[5646.16s -> 5648.16s]  but I have to have the robot to make food.
[5648.16s -> 5651.55s]  Well, can't we just say who cares
[5651.55s -> 5653.55s]  and I can just do whatever I want?
[5653.55s -> 5655.55s]  Can I break away from their control
[5655.55s -> 5657.55s]  at some point? Okay.
[5657.55s -> 5662.29s]  Sure. Put the robot.
[5673.30s -> 5675.30s]  This is so hot with this
[5675.30s -> 5677.30s]  on. Can I go like this?
[5677.30s -> 5679.30s]  No, no, it's just a
[5679.30s -> 5681.30s]  snuggie.
[5681.30s -> 5685.33s]  Oh yeah, snuggie.
[5685.33s -> 5688.08s]  Oh, my mic. I gotta be
[5688.08s -> 5694.54s]  holding on. I'll go like this. I feel
[5694.54s -> 5696.54s]  like this is like a fashion trend right
[5696.54s -> 5698.54s]  now, right? Is it like a dress that people
[5698.54s -> 5700.98s]  wear that looks like this? With like
[5700.98s -> 5702.98s]  a tall turtop and it's like this?
[5702.98s -> 5705.47s]  Right? Don't you think that'd be huge?
[5705.47s -> 5707.47s]  And it goes into a dress?
[5707.47s -> 5710.29s]  I think I found
[5710.29s -> 5712.29s]  look, if you're a designer
[5712.29s -> 5714.29s]  and you make this, I want
[5714.29s -> 5716.91s]  ten percent. It goes around all the
[5716.91s -> 5718.91s]  way back, yeah. All right, food.
[5718.91s -> 5724.10s]  Making food is just annoying and I'm
[5724.10s -> 5726.10s]  not doing it. It's been three days. So what is
[5726.10s -> 5747.34s]  eating a cookie? Not until I
[5747.34s -> 5749.34s]  I'm not dealing with this shit until I eat.
[5761.36s -> 5765.14s]  Fuck this thing off!
[5765.14s -> 5767.50s]  What? We're here on behalf
[5767.50s -> 5769.50s]  of the king. On what
[5769.50s -> 5771.50s]  king? King Elton
[5771.50s -> 5773.50s]  McCartney, the conqueror of the fifth.
[5773.50s -> 5775.87s]  As you
[5775.87s -> 5778.75s]  plans, you must read the
[5778.75s -> 5780.75s]  scroll. I need to read the
[5780.75s -> 5782.75s]  scroll?
[5782.75s -> 5784.75s]  Do we expect you to pledge
[5784.75s -> 5786.75s]  fealty to the king?
[5786.75s -> 5788.75s]  If not, there will be dire
[5788.75s -> 5790.75s]  consequences. I don't know what drugs
[5790.75s -> 5792.75s]  are going around this neighborhood, but it's something hard.
[5792.75s -> 5794.75s]  Pledge-eth, fealty-eth,
[5794.75s -> 5796.75s]  or you'll be severeth.
[5796.75s -> 5798.75s]  So you're going to kill
[5798.75s -> 5800.75s]  me if I don't pledge fealty? What's fealty?
[5800.75s -> 5802.75s]  Pledge fealty to the king for
[5802.75s -> 5804.75s]  five hundred shillings. Five hundred
[5804.75s -> 5806.75s]  shillings? Is that money?
[5806.75s -> 5813.41s]  My youngest kid, Agatha,
[5813.41s -> 5815.65s]  she needs braces.
[5815.65s -> 5817.95s]  We don't have fucking parents. The king doesn't do that.
[5817.95s -> 5819.95s]  Wait, say that one more time.
[5819.95s -> 5821.95s]  My daughter needs braces now. I've been on this job for like a fucking
[5821.95s -> 5823.95s]  month, dude. This is my fourth
[5823.95s -> 5825.95s]  appointment. I'm going to cut you a break.
[5825.95s -> 5827.95s]  Who sent you here, though? Was it like a joke or something?
[5827.95s -> 5829.95s]  No, I'm here on behalf of the king. And
[5829.95s -> 5831.95s]  the thing is, if you don't pay, I get to sever your head.
[5831.95s -> 5833.95s]  I don't know if you've ever used one of these. It's kind of dull. It takes a little bit of time.
[5833.95s -> 5835.95s]  That hurt, actually. I've done three today. I'm fucking
[5835.95s -> 5837.95s]  tired, bro. Just pay me like five hundred shillings
[5837.95s -> 5839.95s]  that's like, you know, 20, 21, 200 bucks.
[5839.95s -> 5841.95s]  You look like shit. You're not even that big.
[5841.95s -> 5843.95s]  I can literally cut your fucking head off
[5843.95s -> 5845.95s]  right now, and I don't want to. My arm's exhausted.
[5845.95s -> 5847.95s]  I've got a torn rotator cuff. I know, but you
[5847.95s -> 5849.95s]  look like shit, and I fucking, I could probably beat you up.
[5849.95s -> 5851.95s]  I could probably punch you in the face and kill you.
[5851.95s -> 5853.95s]  Loser. Loser. That poked me in the eye.
[5853.95s -> 5855.95s]  You're really going to do this?
[5855.95s -> 5857.95s]  Can you just cut me a fucking break? How much money do you need?
[5857.95s -> 5859.95s]  I told you it's five hundred shillings.
[5859.95s -> 5861.95s]  Who is this? Who is this guy?
[5861.95s -> 5865.09s]  That's not your concern, person.
[5865.09s -> 5870.08s]  Are you going to pay or not? Look,
[5870.08s -> 5872.64s]  if you want five hundred bucks from me,
[5872.64s -> 5874.64s]  then I'm going to have to hear a goddamn
[5874.64s -> 5876.64s]  song from this motherfucker right here.
[5876.64s -> 5878.88s]  You want five hundred?
[5878.88s -> 5881.31s]  You're not in a position
[5881.31s -> 5883.31s]  to decide if, who plays,
[5883.31s -> 5888.18s]  to flute if. I want to hear a
[5888.18s -> 5890.18s]  song, don't I? Doesn't everybody else?
[5890.18s -> 5898.35s]  My music sucks.
[5898.35s -> 5900.35s]  You both suck. You're both idiots.
[5900.35s -> 5902.53s]  You both, you're both like probably,
[5902.53s -> 5904.53s]  you probably both stupid. You probably fucking have a thirty
[5904.53s -> 5906.53s]  IQ. Very well!
[5906.53s -> 5908.53s]  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
[5908.53s -> 5910.53s]  No, no, no. I was told to do that.
[5910.53s -> 5912.53s]  Somebody said do that. Who? There's no one here.
[5912.53s -> 5914.53s]  Yes, there is. They're up in the sky.
[5914.53s -> 5916.53s]  I see if no one is. Play, just tell them to play again.
[5916.53s -> 5921.20s]  Okay, five hundred.
[5921.20s -> 5923.20s]  Will five hundred get you to leave?
[5923.20s -> 5925.20s]  Okay, get some music, get some music
[5925.20s -> 5927.63s]  before I look like an idiot.
[5927.63s -> 5929.63s]  Is it decided?
[5929.63s -> 5931.63s]  Yes, take five hundred and leave.
[5931.63s -> 5933.63s]  Then we're an alliance.
[5933.63s -> 5937.15s]  We're an alliance?
[5937.15s -> 5939.15s]  You're not going to hurt me, are you?
[5939.15s -> 5941.15s]  I want to put your head out so I can appreciate it and celebrate.
[5941.15s -> 5944.35s]  What are you doing? You're not...
[5944.35s -> 5946.59s]  You can't just take beers out of the fridge.
[5946.59s -> 5948.59s]  What is it? What?
[5948.59s -> 5950.59s]  This neighborhood, I swear to God,
[5950.59s -> 5952.59s]  everybody is on fucking hard drugs.
[5952.59s -> 5954.59s]  What are you doing?
[5954.59s -> 5956.59s]  I toasted the king!
[5956.59s -> 5958.77s]  No, uh...
[5958.77s -> 5968.10s]  There's nothing left...
[5968.10s -> 5970.10s]  This time next year.
[5970.10s -> 5975.22s]  Watch the phone.
[5975.22s -> 5977.22s]  There's nothing left in here. He drank it all.
[5977.22s -> 5980.22s]  This is the guy that comes in.
[5980.22s -> 5982.22s]  He's the guy that comes in and drinks a beer really fast.
[5982.22s -> 5984.22s]  That's his thing.
[5984.22s -> 5991.46s]  That's his thing that he does.
[5991.46s -> 5993.70s]  Hey, do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast?
[5993.70s -> 5995.70s]  Uh...
[5995.70s -> 5997.94s]  Yeah.
[5997.94s -> 6000.24s]  Yeah, I know a guy that can drink beer real fast.
[6000.24s -> 6002.24s]  This thing is gross.
[6002.24s -> 6007.17s]  I'm putting this in the sink.
[6007.17s -> 6009.17s]  And you left my door open!
[6009.17s -> 6011.17s]  Pledge fealty to the king.
[6011.17s -> 6013.17s]  Well, I hope your daughter got the braces.
[6013.17s -> 6015.17s]  Unbelievable.
[6015.17s -> 6017.73s]  They have a cop here.
[6017.73s -> 6020.42s]  I think the cop is on drugs too.
[6020.42s -> 6022.42s]  Nobody here is...
[6022.42s -> 6024.42s]  Nobody here is sober, okay?
[6024.42s -> 6026.42s]  There's like a bunch of people doing drugs.
[6026.42s -> 6028.42s]  I'm the only sober one in this whole neighborhood.
[6028.42s -> 6031.10s]  But that's not actually accurate
[6031.10s -> 6033.10s]  because I've had like three of those.
[6033.10s -> 6035.71s]  Can I get the bread off the ground at least?
[6037.71s -> 6039.71s]  King Arthur, what is he doing here?
[6041.71s -> 6043.71s]  Why is he like a flute player?
[6051.58s -> 6053.58s]  Hey, do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast?
[6053.58s -> 6056.78s]  What is this?
[6056.78s -> 6061.33s]  Oh, he left it.
[6061.33s -> 6063.63s]  I'm watching some TV.
[6063.63s -> 6072.64s]  I'm gonna put the tube on.
[6072.64s -> 6077.70s]  Alright, what do we got on TV?
[6077.70s -> 6079.70s]  Don't show the TV yet!
[6079.70s -> 6081.70s]  Don't show the TV yet!
[6081.70s -> 6083.70s]  I wouldn't show the television yet.
[6083.70s -> 6086.32s]  I think I need to hit the input button
[6086.32s -> 6090.67s]  to get this to the right channel.
[6090.67s -> 6092.67s]  Okay, I gotta make sure...
[6092.67s -> 6094.67s]  Look, this got installed the other day.
[6094.67s -> 6097.74s]  Alright, what's on TV?
[6097.74s -> 6100.99s]  Let's get ourselves on.
[6100.99s -> 6107.26s]  That's a lot of feedback from a microphone.
[6107.26s -> 6109.63s]  What do we got? What's on TV?
[6109.63s -> 6113.15s]  What's on TV?
[6113.15s -> 6115.15s]  Channel change on here.
[6115.15s -> 6119.50s]  Turn it on.
[6119.50s -> 6121.50s]  This is a weird channel.
[6121.50s -> 6123.50s]  You guys can call 1-800-SEXYMAD
[6123.50s -> 6125.50s]  That's S-E-X-Y-M-A-D
[6125.50s -> 6127.50s]  We ran out of numbers.
[6127.50s -> 6129.50s]  To get my service.
[6129.50s -> 6131.50s]  It costs $2,000 per cleaning
[6131.50s -> 6133.50s]  or $2,500 if...
[6133.50s -> 6135.68s]  You want me to wear cat ears?
[6135.68s -> 6137.68s]  Or $150 if you're a giant piece of shit
[6137.68s -> 6139.68s]  named Jerma
[6139.68s -> 6141.68s]  Change the channel!
[6141.68s -> 6143.68s]  I don't want to see that. Change the channel.
[6143.68s -> 6145.68s]  What's this?
[6171.89s -> 6173.89s]  Change the channel!
[6173.89s -> 6175.89s]  Giant piece of shit!
[6175.89s -> 6177.89s]  Change the channel again!
[6177.89s -> 6179.89s]  Change the channel again!
[6179.89s -> 6181.89s]  Change channel! Change channel!
[6181.89s -> 6184.58s]  Nothing on this one.
[6184.58s -> 6187.46s]  There's nothing on this station.
[6187.46s -> 6189.46s]  There's nothing on this station.
[6189.46s -> 6191.46s]  Or are they just doing dead air on this station?
[6191.46s -> 6195.10s]  Change channel!
[6195.10s -> 6197.10s]  This thing's messed up.
[6197.10s -> 6199.10s]  There it is!
[6199.10s -> 6201.10s]  So if you want to join our church
[6201.10s -> 6203.10s]  you're welcome to come down and join us
[6203.10s -> 6205.10s]  every Sunday at 4.
[6205.10s -> 6207.10s]  We are also streaming live.
[6207.10s -> 6209.10s]  You can check us out anytime online.
[6209.10s -> 6213.10s]  We also fully expect your support financially.
[6213.10s -> 6215.10s]  So please make sure you give us your credit card numbers.
[6215.10s -> 6217.10s]  Alright, get that off.
[6220.69s -> 6222.69s]  TV off!
[6222.69s -> 6234.00s]  He's screaming.
[6234.00s -> 6244.24s]  He's screaming!
[6246.24s -> 6248.80s]  Man, TV is weird out here.
[6248.80s -> 6251.10s]  It seems to be only two or three stations.
[6251.10s -> 6253.10s]  It must be an antenna.
[6253.10s -> 6255.60s]  What happened to this?
[6255.60s -> 6260.19s]  What is that?
[6260.19s -> 6262.19s]  There's three channels on that TV.
[6262.19s -> 6265.84s]  I don't even want to pick it up.
[6265.84s -> 6267.84s]  And I'm not touching that
[6267.84s -> 6269.84s]  because there's poo poo on it.
[6269.84s -> 6274.75s]  Oh my god, there's like beer everywhere.
[6274.75s -> 6276.75s]  This is actually kind of a disaster.
[6276.75s -> 6280.14s]  This is going to get actually cleaned.
[6280.14s -> 6282.14s]  Ugh.
[6282.14s -> 6284.45s]  Interesting.
[6284.45s -> 6287.50s]  Here's the beer stein.
[6287.50s -> 6289.50s]  Whatever you want to call this.
[6289.50s -> 6292.26s]  Let's rinse it out.
[6292.26s -> 6295.39s]  Yuck.
[6295.39s -> 6300.94s]  Ugh. Disgusting.
[6300.94s -> 6307.97s]  I'm going up into the bed.
[6307.97s -> 6312.06s]  I want to sit down.
[6312.06s -> 6314.06s]  There's just a soda.
[6314.06s -> 6317.65s]  There's a non-descript soda over there.
[6317.65s -> 6319.65s]  I want to check out the DIY room.
[6319.65s -> 6321.65s]  Because what does that mean?
[6321.65s -> 6323.65s]  DIY room. Do it yourself.
[6323.65s -> 6329.41s]  DIY?
[6329.41s -> 6331.41s]  I don't want to stream right now.
[6331.41s -> 6338.75s]  I've got a lot going on.
[6338.75s -> 6340.75s]  How am I going to stream on Twitch?
[6343.87s -> 6349.76s]  Okay.
[6349.76s -> 6351.76s]  Where's the mouse and keyboard?
[6351.76s -> 6354.13s]  Where is the mouse?
[6354.13s -> 6356.37s]  Am I still banned on Twitch?
[6356.37s -> 6360.14s]  I don't think so.
[6360.14s -> 6364.24s]  Alright, starting the stream.
[6364.24s -> 6367.25s]  I've got to apologize to everybody.
[6367.25s -> 6369.25s]  Let me go live. It's been like four or five days
[6369.25s -> 6371.25s]  since I got banned like twice.
[6371.25s -> 6373.81s]  I've got to apologize.
[6373.81s -> 6377.46s]  Make sure I look okay.
[6377.46s -> 6379.46s]  I've got to look hot in this video, right?
[6379.46s -> 6384.45s]  Because that's what matters, not the apology.
[6384.45s -> 6386.45s]  I've got to make sure I look good.
[6386.45s -> 6391.81s]  Okay.
[6391.81s -> 6402.10s]  Let's go live.
[6402.10s -> 6404.10s]  Hey, what's up everybody?
[6404.10s -> 6406.40s]  Jerma985 here.
[6406.40s -> 6408.40s]  I know over the last couple of weeks I've been live
[6408.40s -> 6410.40s]  only a few times.
[6410.40s -> 6412.40s]  And it's been
[6412.40s -> 6414.40s]  for only like two or three minutes.
[6414.40s -> 6416.40s]  And then I go BRB.
[6416.40s -> 6419.02s]  I'll be right back.
[6419.02s -> 6435.28s]  Hey everybody, it's Jerma985 here.
[6435.28s -> 6437.28s]  I just want to get some good
[6437.28s -> 6439.28s]  comfortable clothes for this stream.
[6439.28s -> 6441.28s]  Because, you know, it's important
[6441.28s -> 6443.28s]  stuff we're talking about here. I have to apologize
[6443.28s -> 6446.03s]  real quick.
[6446.03s -> 6448.03s]  I've been away.
[6448.03s -> 6450.03s]  And I've been not good to you.
[6450.03s -> 6452.03s]  And you may have seen some things
[6452.03s -> 6454.03s]  on the stream. Me sleeping. You may have seen
[6454.03s -> 6456.03s]  me shitting on stream a few times and going to the bathroom
[6456.03s -> 6458.03s]  on stream. But I want to say I don't condone
[6458.03s -> 6460.03s]  going to the bathroom on stream. I find
[6460.03s -> 6462.03s]  it disgusting and repulsive.
[6462.03s -> 6464.03s]  And I find that anybody that would do that
[6464.03s -> 6466.03s]  would be completely out of their mind.
[6466.03s -> 6468.03s]  I don't condone it.
[6468.03s -> 6470.03s]  And it's not me. It's me from a while ago.
[6470.03s -> 6472.03s]  It's a past me. I just want to say that I'm sorry
[6472.03s -> 6474.03s]  about my past me that would have actually gone
[6474.03s -> 6476.03s]  to the bathroom on stream.
[6476.03s -> 6478.03s]  And that would have gone BRB and gone to sleep.
[6478.03s -> 6481.30s]  That's not me.
[6481.30s -> 6483.30s]  That's not me. I would, I mean,
[6483.30s -> 6485.30s]  that's not me. As of a week ago, that's not me. I'm a new
[6485.30s -> 6487.30s]  person. I mean, it was a week ago.
[6487.30s -> 6489.30s]  It was a week ago. But it's not me.
[6489.30s -> 6491.30s]  That's not who I am. I also want to say
[6491.30s -> 6493.30s]  very, very much sorry to
[6493.30s -> 6495.30s]  Al, Migraine, to Amelia.
[6495.30s -> 6497.30s]  What? I want to say sorry to Amelia.
[6497.30s -> 6499.30s]  Because they didn't
[6499.30s -> 6501.30s]  deserve that kind of treatment. And I really feel
[6501.30s -> 6503.30s]  like that they, that I really just want
[6503.30s -> 6505.30s]  to say sorry to them. They saw me
[6505.30s -> 6507.30s]  having sex
[6507.30s -> 6509.30s]  with death in my bed.
[6509.30s -> 6511.30s]  And I just want to say that that's not
[6511.30s -> 6513.30s]  me. That's not me. That's not who I am.
[6513.30s -> 6515.30s]  I don't have sex with like three different
[6515.30s -> 6517.30s]  people and like lie to everybody. As of a
[6517.30s -> 6519.30s]  week ago. It was three days ago. But that's not me.
[6519.30s -> 6521.30s]  That's not who I am.
[6521.30s -> 6523.30s]  I woohooed him.
[6523.30s -> 6525.30s]  We can't say that word.
[6525.30s -> 6531.57s]  Or can we?
[6531.57s -> 6533.57s]  I woohooed! Woohooed!
[6533.57s -> 6535.57s]  It's not the same! It's not
[6535.57s -> 6537.57s]  the same thing, Chad. Woohoo
[6537.57s -> 6539.57s]  is a different term.
[6539.57s -> 6541.57s]  Although I just really screwed up and said
[6541.57s -> 6543.57s]  something else. Woohoo's
[6543.57s -> 6545.57s]  different. It's different. We woohooed.
[6545.57s -> 6547.57s]  We both said woohoo. We had a great
[6547.57s -> 6549.57s]  time. And look, I'm sorry.
[6549.57s -> 6551.57s]  I'm sorry. I'm apologizing for that. Let me apologize for the
[6551.57s -> 6553.57s]  apology, too. I'm very sorry about that
[6553.57s -> 6555.57s]  apology. How I said something else that wasn't
[6555.57s -> 6557.57s]  what we did. We were upstairs.
[6557.57s -> 6559.57s]  We rolled around. We went, whoa! Woohoo!
[6559.57s -> 6561.57s]  And that's it. That's all that happened. That's
[6561.57s -> 6945.95s]  it.
[6945.95s -> 6948.19s]  I'm really sorry for apologizing for the
[6948.19s -> 6950.50s]  apology. For this time, I mean it.
[6950.50s -> 6952.50s]  I know you might,
[6952.50s -> 6954.50s]  some of you might think I'm like a shitty person, but
[6954.50s -> 6956.74s]  I don't care.
[6956.74s -> 6958.74s]  You paid me a lot of money, so I don't care.
[6958.74s -> 6960.74s]  But like, you know, I'm
[6960.74s -> 6962.74s]  just going to do this to make sure everybody's happy about it.
[6962.74s -> 6966.51s]  I'm sure everybody's
[6966.51s -> 6968.51s]  happy about that.
[6968.51s -> 6970.51s]  I'm sorry that I said the S
[6970.51s -> 6972.51s]  word. The S word.
[6972.51s -> 6974.51s]  S-E. I can't even say it. Oh, it's
[6974.51s -> 6976.51s]  not me. Sorry, I'm not that person.
[6976.51s -> 6978.51s]  S-E. Oh, I can't say it. You know what I mean?
[6978.51s -> 6980.51s]  Like, that's not me from yesterday.
[6980.51s -> 6982.51s]  From when I went to sleep that time.
[6982.51s -> 6984.51s]  I can't even say that word. Oh, I can't even say it anymore.
[6984.51s -> 6986.51s]  It's fucking disgusting to me.
[6986.51s -> 6988.51s]  But yeah, I'm really
[6988.51s -> 6990.51s]  sorry about that, and
[6990.51s -> 6993.14s]  what? I've been permanently
[6993.14s -> 6995.14s]  banned from Twitch.
[6995.14s -> 6998.46s]  Permanently. Indefinitely.
[6998.46s -> 7001.52s]  But indefinite
[7001.52s -> 7004.21s]  means like,
[7004.21s -> 7006.21s]  no, I'll just record an apology
[7006.21s -> 7008.21s]  video, and then I'll send it to Twitch.
[7008.21s -> 7010.96s]  Twitch. I'm going to record an apology
[7010.96s -> 7013.58s]  video. Hey,
[7013.58s -> 7015.89s]  get the OBS out.
[7015.89s -> 7018.64s]  Get over here.
[7018.64s -> 7020.88s]  No, not with a toilet.
[7020.88s -> 7022.88s]  I'm going to be stupid. Don't be dumb.
[7022.88s -> 7024.88s]  Oh yeah, sorry
[7024.88s -> 7026.88s]  Twitch. Please appeal the ban
[7026.88s -> 7028.88s]  in front of a toilet. Pink
[7028.88s -> 7034.06s]  background's fine. Hey, Twitch.
[7034.06s -> 7036.06s]  It's me, Jerma, here. I just wanted to appeal
[7036.06s -> 7038.06s]  the ban that I had.
[7038.06s -> 7040.56s]  I was on a lot of drugs,
[7040.56s -> 7042.56s]  and I didn't mean any of those
[7042.56s -> 7044.56s]  things.
[7044.56s -> 7049.23s]  Delete that.
[7049.23s -> 7053.14s]  Hey. Delete it again.
[7053.14s -> 7056.72s]  Start over. Hey, Twitch.
[7056.72s -> 7058.72s]  It's me, Jerma985 here. I just
[7058.72s -> 7060.72s]  wanted to make sure I check in with you and see that I got a permanent
[7060.72s -> 7062.72s]  indefinite kind of ban.
[7062.72s -> 7064.72s]  What you saw the last few days,
[7064.72s -> 7066.72s]  it's been kind of crazy.
[7066.72s -> 7068.72s]  A gladiator came in and was like threatening to
[7068.72s -> 7070.72s]  kill me, and I'm going to start over
[7070.72s -> 7072.72s]  again. Again, one more time.
[7072.72s -> 7075.79s]  Make sure to look taller and bigger, because
[7075.79s -> 7077.79s]  the minion you were presenting, get the robe off too.
[7077.79s -> 7084.90s]  Hey, Twitch. It's me,
[7084.90s -> 7086.90s]  Jerma985 here. Just wanted to
[7086.90s -> 7088.90s]  give you a quick update of
[7088.90s -> 7090.90s]  what happened over the last few days and appeal the ban.
[7090.90s -> 7092.90s]  Um, I
[7092.90s -> 7094.90s]  was attacked by a bear a couple times.
[7094.90s -> 7098.80s]  I don't care. Whatever. Fuck it.
[7098.80s -> 7100.80s]  I'm banned forever. Don't care.
[7100.80s -> 7133.17s]  Or I do. Twitch,
[7133.17s -> 7135.17s]  I got hacked, and somebody posted on
[7135.17s -> 7137.17s]  my behalf, and it wasn't even me.
[7137.17s -> 7139.17s]  So I'm sorry about it.
[7139.17s -> 7142.54s]  Send that email. Send.
[7142.54s -> 7144.54s]  Send. I'm going to take a shower.
[7144.54s -> 7157.07s]  What am I going to do about money?
[7157.07s -> 7159.76s]  What am I going to do?
[7159.76s -> 7161.76s]  Why is the water not working?
[7161.76s -> 7164.58s]  Fuck. How am I
[7164.58s -> 7167.01s]  going to get paid?
[7167.01s -> 7170.53s]  What am I supposed to do?
[7170.53s -> 7173.66s]  I brush my teeth in the shower
[7173.66s -> 7175.97s]  every day.
[7175.97s -> 7177.97s]  That was a quick shower.
[7177.97s -> 7179.97s]  That was a quick shower. What was that?
[7183.04s -> 7185.04s]  You know the move. You know the move.
[7185.04s -> 7203.26s]  My arm
[7203.26s -> 7205.26s]  still hurts from the window.
[7205.26s -> 7220.10s]  From Twitch.
[7220.10s -> 7222.10s]  It's not even funny.
[7222.10s -> 7229.20s]  It's not even funny.
[7229.20s -> 7231.20s]  Watch TV.
[7231.20s -> 7233.20s]  ...
[7233.20s -> 7235.20s]  ...
[7235.20s -> 7237.57s]  ...
[7237.57s -> 7239.57s]  ...
[7239.57s -> 7241.57s]  ...
[7241.57s -> 7243.87s]  ...
[7243.87s -> 7245.87s]  ...
[7245.87s -> 7249.78s]  ...
[7249.78s -> 7251.78s]  ...
[7251.78s -> 7254.53s]  ...
[7254.53s -> 7260.48s]  I want to watch TV.
[7260.48s -> 7264.90s]  That sounds like a plan to me.
[7264.90s -> 7271.55s]  What's on TV today?
[7271.55s -> 7273.55s]  Journal on.
[7273.55s -> 7275.55s]  Residents of Dollhouse.
[7275.55s -> 7277.55s]  We have an emergency announcement.
[7277.55s -> 7279.55s]  There has been a gorilla reported on the loose.
[7279.55s -> 7281.55s]  After speaking with the gorilla,
[7281.55s -> 7283.55s]  we did get some information about the motive
[7283.55s -> 7285.55s]  of his escape.
[7285.55s -> 7287.55s]  After dispute with his mother about not liking
[7287.55s -> 7289.55s]  his girlfriend,
[7289.55s -> 7291.55s]  he has decided to escape
[7291.55s -> 7293.55s]  his enclosure.
[7293.55s -> 7295.55s]  Here we have Randy, our specialist in the area
[7295.55s -> 7297.55s]  on gorillas and bears.
[7297.55s -> 7299.55s]  Randy, do you have any advice to offer citizens
[7299.55s -> 7301.55s]  if they encounter this gorilla?
[7301.55s -> 7303.55s]  The first thing you have to remember is you're dealing
[7303.55s -> 7305.55s]  with a wild animal.
[7305.55s -> 7307.55s]  It's dealing with heartache.
[7307.55s -> 7309.55s]  The first thing you need to do is make sure that if you
[7309.55s -> 7311.55s]  are going to approach these animals,
[7311.55s -> 7313.55s]  make sure you take somebody slower than you
[7313.55s -> 7315.55s]  because you want to be able to outrun them
[7315.55s -> 7317.55s]  in case you get attacked by that animal.
[7317.55s -> 7319.55s]  Second of all,
[7319.55s -> 7321.55s]  don't forget to play dead
[7321.55s -> 7323.55s]  because then you'll know what it's like when they kill you.
[7323.55s -> 7325.55s]  I would advise against
[7325.55s -> 7327.55s]  pepper spray.
[7327.55s -> 7329.55s]  Bears love the taste of pepper on human flesh.
[7329.55s -> 7331.55s]  I would suggest rubbing your body
[7331.55s -> 7333.55s]  with steamed broccoli before going out
[7333.55s -> 7335.55s]  after these animals.
[7335.55s -> 7337.55s]  Wonderful. Thank you so much, Randy.
[7337.55s -> 7339.55s]  Is there anything else you would like to say?
[7339.55s -> 7341.55s]  Did you get any more information behind the motive
[7341.55s -> 7343.55s]  from this gorilla?
[7343.55s -> 7345.55s]  No, really. Just the whole conversation was
[7345.55s -> 7347.55s]  it was just bananas, really.
[7347.55s -> 7349.55s]  It's just crazy. I'm not quite sure
[7349.55s -> 7351.55s]  what we're going to do.
[7351.55s -> 7353.55s]  That was fantastic. That was a great segue.
[7353.55s -> 7357.33s]  TV has been turned off.
[7357.33s -> 7359.33s]  A gorilla on the loose.
[7359.33s -> 7363.49s]  I don't have broccoli.
[7363.49s -> 7365.49s]  I don't have whatever else it was.
[7365.49s -> 7386.29s]  Really?
[7386.29s -> 7389.23s]  Right after the segment
[7389.23s -> 7394.67s]  on television?
[7394.67s -> 7396.67s]  I want to move. I want to move.
[7396.67s -> 7398.67s]  I don't want to live here anymore.
[7398.67s -> 7400.67s]  Why does it feel like everything is coming to get me?
[7400.67s -> 7402.67s]  And there are my glasses.
[7402.67s -> 7404.67s]  That was loud.
[7404.67s -> 7406.67s]  There's my glasses.
[7406.67s -> 7408.67s]  Everybody's trying to kill me in this town.
[7408.67s -> 7411.17s]  How could you possibly
[7411.17s -> 7413.17s]  live here for more than a week?
[7413.17s -> 7416.74s]  What the fuck?
[7416.74s -> 7418.74s]  I'm not going out there.
[7418.74s -> 7420.74s]  You saw what happened last time.
[7420.74s -> 7422.74s]  I'm not going out there again to get attacked.
[7422.74s -> 7429.25s]  I'm going to call a bear.
[7429.25s -> 7431.25s]  Call a bear?
[7431.25s -> 7433.25s]  What does that even mean, call bear?
[7433.25s -> 7435.25s]  Call bear?
[7435.25s -> 7437.25s]  I don't have a bear's phone number, do I?
[7437.25s -> 7439.25s]  I guess I do. My hand is doing it.
[7439.25s -> 7442.90s]  Hello?
[7442.90s -> 7445.71s]  I'd like to call
[7445.71s -> 7447.71s]  a bear service to come attack.
[7447.71s -> 7449.71s]  So help me, I guess.
[7449.71s -> 7452.14s]  This is a real service?
[7452.14s -> 7454.45s]  Okay, thank you.
[7454.45s -> 7456.45s]  How much does it cost?
[7456.45s -> 7458.45s]  That's too much money, but
[7458.45s -> 7460.45s]  Alright, god damn it.
[7460.45s -> 7466.08s]  Send him, send him in!
[7466.08s -> 7471.33s]  What the fuck?
[7471.33s -> 7474.98s]  It's a gorilla in my yard!
[7474.98s -> 7476.98s]  It's a gorilla in my... shit.
[7476.98s -> 7494.56s]  Did somebody just say
[7494.56s -> 7505.76s]  red rum?
[7505.76s -> 7514.34s]  Are we alright?
[7514.34s -> 7518.88s]  Oh, that's quite a mess out here.
[7518.88s -> 7521.25s]  Nobody here, okay.
[7521.25s -> 7523.25s]  How much does that cost?
[7523.25s -> 7525.25s]  A bear service?
[7525.25s -> 7527.25s]  That was the bear that was here before, but he was friendly this time.
[7527.25s -> 7529.86s]  What does that cost?
[7529.86s -> 7531.86s]  The maid's going to have to...
[7531.86s -> 7533.86s]  Amelia, I'm still paying for your service.
[7533.86s -> 7535.86s]  It doesn't mean you don't come anymore.
[7535.86s -> 7542.05s]  $250
[7542.05s -> 7544.05s]  for a bear?
[7544.05s -> 7549.17s]  Was it $2,500 or $250?
[7549.17s -> 7552.11s]  I was going to say
[7552.11s -> 7554.29s]  that's pretty cheap if it was $2,500.
[7554.29s -> 7556.98s]  Good thing it was an extra zero.
[7556.98s -> 7560.67s]  Get this back over here.
[7560.67s -> 7567.01s]  Where it belongs, please.
[7567.01s -> 7569.01s]  It sucks.
[7569.01s -> 7576.24s]  This actually sucks.
[7576.24s -> 7585.95s]  It sucks living here.
[7585.95s -> 7590.62s]  I fucking hate living here.
[7590.62s -> 7597.14s]  I actually don't like being here.
[7597.14s -> 7599.14s]  I mean, it's a nice house, but
[7599.14s -> 7601.14s]  what is this neighborhood?
[7601.14s -> 7603.14s]  Bears, gorillas,
[7603.14s -> 7605.14s]  people that aren't drugs just attacking you.
[7605.14s -> 7609.30s]  We're like church groups that come into your house
[7609.30s -> 7611.30s]  and just don't even knock.
[7611.30s -> 7613.73s]  I don't know.
[7613.73s -> 7615.73s]  The police just sit on your couch and drink sodas and stuff.
[7615.73s -> 7617.73s]  People drink beer out of my fridge.
[7617.73s -> 7619.73s]  Mess.
[7619.73s -> 7632.51s]  Not today, not today.
[7632.51s -> 7634.51s]  Tomorrow.
[7634.51s -> 7647.50s]  Tomorrow, but tomorrow.
[7647.50s -> 7649.74s]  Why can't you just do tomorrow?
[7649.74s -> 7654.61s]  Showed up like this.
[7654.61s -> 7656.61s]  People aren't going to be happy about it.
[7656.61s -> 7659.17s]  Hello.
[7659.17s -> 7662.54s]  I'm going to work.
[7662.54s -> 7665.42s]  Fine.
[7665.42s -> 7667.92s]  Just wait, I'm coming.
[7667.92s -> 7670.93s]  That looks like a full car today.
[7670.93s -> 7672.93s]  Do I have to sit in the middle?
[7672.93s -> 7674.93s]  No, I don't want to sit in the middle.
[7674.93s -> 7676.93s]  Fine, just move.
[7676.93s -> 7977.39s]  That was a long day.
[7977.39s -> 7979.39s]  I sit in the middle because I'm the smallest one.
[7979.39s -> 7981.39s]  I know I always put it up for grabs
[7981.39s -> 7983.39s]  and I always say I'll do it, but that doesn't mean I want to.
[7983.39s -> 7985.39s]  Maybe next time I can get in the front
[7985.39s -> 7987.39s]  just once.
[7987.39s -> 7989.39s]  Just one time I sit in the front seat.
[7989.39s -> 7992.02s]  Sitting in the middle sucks.
[7992.02s -> 7994.02s]  I know I'm like the smallest guy,
[7994.02s -> 7996.02s]  but whatever, whatever works.
[7996.02s -> 7998.26s]  Thank you. See you on Saturday.
[7998.26s -> 8000.26s]  If you get a fucking invite.
[8004.94s -> 8006.94s]  Was that like a fun beep or was that like a you're mad beep?
[8006.94s -> 8008.94s]  I can't tell. You do that all the time.
[8008.94s -> 8011.70s]  You do that like every day.
[8015.70s -> 8017.70s]  I don't know if that's like you're making me look like an idiot.
[8021.47s -> 8023.47s]  Hi Edna, how are you?
[8023.47s -> 8025.47s]  Good day to you.
[8025.47s -> 8027.47s]  I'm doing well.
[8027.47s -> 8029.47s]  Treating you well?
[8029.47s -> 8031.47s]  Good, sweetheart. It's a strange world out there.
[8033.47s -> 8035.78s]  Okay. See you later.
[8035.78s -> 8039.79s]  Okay.
[8039.79s -> 8042.61s]  A lot of people in this neighborhood.
[8042.61s -> 8046.70s]  I gotta take this off.
[8046.70s -> 8048.70s]  I'm gonna get more comfortable.
[8048.70s -> 8050.70s]  My brain, my brain.
[8050.70s -> 8052.70s]  I need to probably play a quickie keyboard.
[8054.70s -> 8056.70s]  Did that cost money?
[8056.70s -> 8063.79s]  The maid has not been here.
[8063.79s -> 8068.66s]  I don't know where the maid has been.
[8068.66s -> 8071.28s]  But look, I know we had like an issue,
[8071.28s -> 8073.28s]  but you're still a maid.
[8073.28s -> 8075.28s]  I pay for a service.
[8075.28s -> 8087.82s]  Was the maid here?
[8087.82s -> 8091.79s]  Was the maid in the house?
[8091.79s -> 8093.79s]  Did Amelia take these?
[8093.79s -> 8096.03s]  That's Uncle Ted's stuff.
[8096.03s -> 8099.74s]  Oh, okay. So you were here.
[8099.74s -> 8101.74s]  Oh, I get it. I get it.
[8101.74s -> 8103.74s]  Oh, I'm mad.
[8103.74s -> 8105.74s]  Because you woohooed with death.
[8107.74s -> 8109.74s]  So I'm gonna take Ted's prize possession.
[8109.74s -> 8111.74s]  Okay.
[8111.74s -> 8113.74s]  Real funny.
[8113.74s -> 8115.74s]  Real funny.
[8115.74s -> 8117.74s]  We'll see if you come back again.
[8117.74s -> 8119.74s]  I'll get you right in the eye.
[8119.74s -> 8121.74s]  I'll look you right in the eye.
[8121.74s -> 8124.50s]  I'll tell you, get out of here and you're fired.
[8124.50s -> 8126.50s]  Unbelievable.
[8126.50s -> 8128.50s]  Unbelievable.
[8128.50s -> 8130.50s]  That's money.
[8130.50s -> 8136.37s]  I pay for a service regardless of if we have a problem.
[8136.37s -> 8138.37s]  It's unbelievable.
[8138.37s -> 8140.37s]  Take things from my goddamn house.
[8140.37s -> 8143.76s]  Because what? Because we had a problem?
[8143.76s -> 8145.76s]  We weren't even like, hold on.
[8145.76s -> 8149.15s]  Here's the worst part about this.
[8149.15s -> 8151.15s]  We weren't doing anything.
[8151.15s -> 8153.15s]  We had a date that was planned.
[8153.15s -> 8157.38s]  One date planned.
[8157.38s -> 8160.58s]  Can I dust my fingerprints?
[8160.58s -> 8162.58s]  Hold on a second.
[8162.58s -> 8164.58s]  We had one date planned.
[8164.58s -> 8170.83s]  I have to pee bad.
[8170.83s -> 8173.01s]  I'm starving.
[8173.01s -> 8188.94s]  And I'm tired.
[8188.94s -> 8190.94s]  This felt right today like this.
[8190.94s -> 8205.71s]  Looks good.
[8205.71s -> 8207.71s]  I'm hungry too.
[8207.71s -> 8209.71s]  Flush, don't just not flush. Come on, what is this?
[8209.71s -> 8215.15s]  I still have to record the apology video.
[8215.15s -> 8217.15s]  For the apology video, for the apology video, for the apology video.
[8217.15s -> 8219.15s]  For the apology.
[8219.15s -> 8226.45s]  Wait, hold on. Did you take anything else?
[8226.45s -> 8237.97s]  You took Ted's spoons.
[8237.97s -> 8239.97s]  Did you take Ted's furniture too?
[8239.97s -> 8244.75s]  I'm hungry.
[8244.75s -> 8248.21s]  Nothing missing from this room?
[8248.21s -> 8251.66s]  Emilia, give me a break.
[8251.66s -> 8253.66s]  Give me a break.
[8253.66s -> 8263.57s]  Alright, let's make some food.
[8263.57s -> 8266.26s]  Hopefully I feel a little bit better.
[8266.26s -> 8271.31s]  Oh, what?
[8271.31s -> 8273.31s]  Oh my god, a coffee maker.
[8273.31s -> 8275.31s]  I didn't even see this.
[8275.31s -> 8277.55s]  Oh my god, I love coffee.
[8277.55s -> 8279.55s]  That's perfect in the mornings. That's perfect.
[8279.55s -> 8283.97s]  Thank you.
[8283.97s -> 8292.80s]  It's a little dirty in there.
[8292.80s -> 8297.14s]  It's a little dirty.
[8297.14s -> 8300.34s]  That was extra dirty.
[8300.34s -> 8302.70s]  Oh, coffee!
[8302.70s -> 8304.70s]  Alright, food.
[8304.70s -> 8327.86s]  That's good.
[8327.86s -> 8330.80s]  That's a good baked, roasted
[8330.80s -> 8332.80s]  cooking.
[8332.80s -> 8338.11s]  Anything in here?
[8338.11s -> 8343.79s]  It's in here.
[8343.79s -> 8345.97s]  Why are there almonds in here?
[8345.97s -> 8348.66s]  Look at this.
[8348.66s -> 8352.05s]  There's a shitload of
[8352.05s -> 8359.22s]  pecans in here.
[8359.22s -> 8361.22s]  I'm tired.
[8361.22s -> 8363.22s]  I'm very tired and I'm not having a good
[8363.22s -> 8365.58s]  time at all.
[8365.58s -> 8367.58s]  Contrary to popular belief that we have laughing.
[8367.58s -> 8372.58s]  Make the bed.
[8372.58s -> 8374.88s]  I'll eat the rest of that cookie later.
[8374.88s -> 8377.25s]  I'll eat his cookies.
[8377.25s -> 8382.05s]  I'm like a six year old.
[8382.05s -> 8384.05s]  I want chicken tenders, french fries,
[8384.05s -> 8386.74s]  and cookies.
[8386.74s -> 8388.74s]  Can you even live off of pecan sandies?
[8388.74s -> 8390.74s]  Somebody look this up.
[8390.74s -> 8392.74s]  When do you die?
[8392.74s -> 8394.74s]  At what point after eating just pecan sandies?
[8394.74s -> 8398.13s]  I'm going to make my bed.
[8398.13s -> 8404.77s]  It's just like sugar,
[8404.77s -> 8406.77s]  bread, and like flour.
[8406.77s -> 8410.54s]  Can you live off of flour?
[8410.54s -> 8412.54s]  I think you can live off flour for at least a week.
[8412.54s -> 8415.73s]  I hope so.
[8415.73s -> 8425.14s]  Sorry, I take a multivitamin. You just don't see it.
[8425.14s -> 8428.34s]  You want one of these?
[8428.34s -> 8432.16s]  You want one of these?
[8432.16s -> 8436.13s]  Too bad they're sold out.
[8436.13s -> 8438.13s]  I actually think they are.
[8438.13s -> 8440.13s]  Germany985.com
[8440.13s -> 8445.87s]  Make the bed.
[8445.87s -> 8449.07s]  Hi.
[8449.07s -> 8451.07s]  We were just doing a little
[8451.07s -> 8453.07s]  work out.
[8453.07s -> 8455.07s]  You left your front door
[8455.07s -> 8457.07s]  unlocked.
[8457.07s -> 8459.07s]  I have a very important
[8459.07s -> 8461.07s]  quick question. Do you both
[8461.07s -> 8464.14s]  have a house?
[8464.14s -> 8466.14s]  I have a condo. It's my mom's condo.
[8466.14s -> 8468.14s]  It's just a temporary thing.
[8468.14s -> 8470.14s]  How much room is in the condo?
[8470.14s -> 8472.14s]  It's a one bedroom. Small.
[8472.14s -> 8474.14s]  About the size of a phone booth.
[8474.14s -> 8476.14s]  Do you have a house?
[8476.14s -> 8478.14s]  A condo?
[8478.14s -> 8480.14s]  Rental?
[8480.14s -> 8482.14s]  Gladys, I think it might be time.
[8482.14s -> 8484.14s]  I'm feeling a little overheated.
[8484.14s -> 8486.14s]  How long have you been in here?
[8486.14s -> 8488.14s]  I never really time my workouts.
[8488.14s -> 8490.14s]  When my body says it's done,
[8490.14s -> 8492.14s]  I know it's done.
[8492.14s -> 8494.14s]  But you have to do it in somebody's
[8494.14s -> 8496.14s]  bedroom in the neighborhood.
[8496.14s -> 8498.14s]  Wherever there's free space, we figured you're new to the
[8498.14s -> 8500.14s]  neighborhood.
[8500.14s -> 8502.14s]  Remember the 60 mile run?
[8502.14s -> 8504.14s]  I don't want you to leave.
[8504.14s -> 8506.14s]  I don't want you to leave.
[8506.14s -> 8508.14s]  In fact, I want you to
[8508.14s -> 8510.14s]  show me some workouts.
[8510.14s -> 8512.14s]  I would love to do some workouts.
[8512.14s -> 8514.14s]  Someone's had a change of attitude.
[8514.14s -> 8516.14s]  This is a nice shirt too.
[8516.14s -> 8518.14s]  Sweating.
[8518.14s -> 8520.14s]  You know why? Because the secret's in the sweat.
[8520.14s -> 8522.14s]  I think that is very sexy.
[8522.14s -> 8524.14s]  That is sexy
[8524.14s -> 8526.14s]  and awesome.
[8526.14s -> 8528.14s]  I'm very much into it.
[8528.14s -> 8530.14s]  It's a little forward.
[8530.14s -> 8532.14s]  I think you're wonderful.
[8532.14s -> 8534.14s]  Listen, someone's got a silver tongue.
[8534.14s -> 8536.14s]  Here's the first exercise.
[8536.14s -> 8538.14s]  Gladys, try to keep up this time.
[8538.14s -> 8540.14s]  Just perfect.
[8540.14s -> 8542.14s]  Hands up.
[8542.14s -> 8544.14s]  We've got spirit fingers.
[8544.14s -> 8546.14s]  I'm really tired.
[8546.14s -> 8548.14s]  Something light.
[8548.14s -> 8550.14s]  We're screwing in the light bulbs.
[8550.14s -> 8552.14s]  We're screwing in the light bulbs.
[8552.14s -> 8554.14s]  We're screwing in the light bulbs.
[8554.14s -> 8556.14s]  I find you very handsome and attractive.
[8556.14s -> 8558.14s]  That's not part of the workout.
[8558.14s -> 8560.14s]  That's just going to pretend
[8560.14s -> 8562.14s]  that didn't happen.
[8562.14s -> 8564.14s]  Now we're going to do the sprinkler.
[8564.14s -> 8566.14s]  Follow me.
[8566.14s -> 8568.14s]  I don't want to do the sprinkler.
[8568.14s -> 8570.14s]  Hey.
[8570.14s -> 8572.14s]  Hey.
[8572.14s -> 8574.14s]  I want to hear a better hey.
[8574.14s -> 8576.14s]  Hey.
[8576.14s -> 8578.14s]  That's a bit better.
[8578.14s -> 8580.14s]  I like that game Dark Souls.
[8580.14s -> 8582.14s]  Game Dark Souls.
[8582.14s -> 8584.14s]  We'll do it again.
[8584.14s -> 8586.14s]  Okay.
[8586.14s -> 8588.14s]  There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[8588.14s -> 8590.14s]  There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[8590.14s -> 8592.14s]  There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[8592.14s -> 8594.14s]  Oh, there's something stuck in the fax machine.
[8594.14s -> 8596.14s]  Get out of there.
[8596.14s -> 8598.14s]  There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[8598.14s -> 8600.14s]  There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[8600.14s -> 8602.14s]  There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[8604.14s -> 8606.14s]  You all right?
[8606.14s -> 8608.14s]  You going to be okay?
[8608.14s -> 8610.14s]  Screw you, Dad.
[8610.14s -> 8612.90s]  Hey.
[8612.90s -> 8614.90s]  You should look at the time.
[8614.90s -> 8616.90s]  I think it's bedtime.
[8616.90s -> 8618.90s]  I think it's time for me to go to bed right now.
[8618.90s -> 8625.23s]  Okay. Come on, Gladys.
[8625.23s -> 9071.17s]  Close that door, Gladys.
[9071.17s -> 9146.48s]  Oh.
[9146.48s -> 9148.48s]  I heard something
[9148.48s -> 9151.17s]  last night.
[9151.17s -> 9153.17s]  Oh, that was a very weird dream.
[9153.17s -> 9157.78s]  Oh.
[9157.78s -> 9160.72s]  It's Otto.
[9160.72s -> 9171.79s]  Wait, hold on.
[9171.79s -> 9173.79s]  There was an explosion
[9173.79s -> 9175.79s]  last night.
[9175.79s -> 9179.18s]  I don't know what it was.
[9179.18s -> 9185.90s]  I mean,
[9185.90s -> 9188.27s]  something just followed me
[9188.27s -> 9191.09s]  through here.
[9191.09s -> 9196.53s]  It smelled.
[9196.53s -> 9202.54s]  What was that? Is it a gas line?
[9202.54s -> 9207.66s]  Holy shit.
[9207.66s -> 9211.76s]  That's not me, is it?
[9211.76s -> 9219.38s]  Oh, my God. I think it is.
[9219.38s -> 9223.34s]  You want one of these?
[9223.34s -> 9226.22s]  What is this?
[9226.22s -> 9237.68s]  Oh, cabinets.
[9237.68s -> 9240.99s]  Stools in here.
[9240.99s -> 9242.99s]  And I'm not going to show this
[9242.99s -> 9245.94s]  what they're going to do.
[9245.94s -> 9247.94s]  I'm not going to show it because I know the audio guy.
[9247.94s -> 9250.18s]  I know what they're going to do.
[9250.18s -> 9252.18s]  In fact, audio guy,
[9252.18s -> 9254.18s]  I don't want you to play the sound that you want to play.
[9254.18s -> 9263.78s]  Play something else.
[9263.78s -> 9269.09s]  Oh, there's a poop emoji
[9269.09s -> 9271.09s]  in there. Okay.
[9271.09s -> 9274.93s]  What else is in here?
[9274.93s -> 9279.54s]  These are so heavy.
[9279.54s -> 9284.83s]  Oh,
[9284.83s -> 9286.83s]  the stool.
[9286.83s -> 9288.83s]  Wow. We had a lot of these.
[9288.83s -> 9292.48s]  And a smiley balloon.
[9292.48s -> 9297.97s]  I kind of don't...
[9297.97s -> 9299.97s]  Oh, that's sad.
[9299.97s -> 9301.97s]  That's really sad.
[9301.97s -> 9305.62s]  Nice cabinets.
[9305.62s -> 9307.79s]  What a waste of money.
[9307.79s -> 9309.79s]  You could have bought literally anything else.
[9309.79s -> 9313.50s]  What am I doing?
[9313.50s -> 9320.27s]  Decorate?
[9320.27s -> 9322.83s]  Decorate this room?
[9322.83s -> 9327.76s]  Let me first of all do this.
[9327.76s -> 9331.54s]  Remember, German985.com
[9331.54s -> 9333.54s]  if you want some merchandise from this stream.
[9333.54s -> 9335.54s]  It's all sold out, but who cares?
[9335.54s -> 9348.59s]  Let's see if I can get this open.
[9348.59s -> 9351.71s]  Decorate?
[9351.71s -> 9353.71s]  It's probably actually a pretty good time to do this room.
[9353.71s -> 9355.71s]  I think so.
[9355.71s -> 9358.21s]  We'll do this.
[9358.21s -> 9362.75s]  I don't like this being open.
[9362.75s -> 9364.75s]  I don't like that.
[9364.75s -> 9366.75s]  I don't like that one.
[9366.75s -> 9369.70s]  I like this one. I like that being open.
[9369.70s -> 9373.90s]  I want it open.
[9373.90s -> 9378.83s]  This fell. Get this out of the way.
[9378.83s -> 9381.76s]  This is the DIY room.
[9381.76s -> 9384.90s]  And if you don't know what a DIY room is,
[9384.90s -> 9386.90s]  it's do it yourself.
[9386.90s -> 9389.14s]  So we're going to be
[9389.14s -> 9391.14s]  you and I, of course.
[9391.14s -> 9393.14s]  We're going to be painting these rooms, maybe.
[9393.14s -> 9395.76s]  Pick a good color. I hope you do.
[9395.76s -> 9399.15s]  Hey, want to sit in crazy?
[9399.15s -> 9401.90s]  I command this to go into the bathroom!
[9403.90s -> 9410.50s]  Did it go into the bathroom?
[9410.50s -> 9413.76s]  It did.
[9413.76s -> 9418.24s]  I have magical powers!
[9418.24s -> 9421.17s]  Let's move this.
[9421.17s -> 9425.01s]  Get this out of the way.
[9425.01s -> 9427.01s]  This is so fucking heavy.
[9427.01s -> 9429.63s]  What a waste of fucking money.
[9429.63s -> 9436.85s]  Okay.
[9436.85s -> 9439.79s]  Okay.
[9439.79s -> 9441.79s]  That's not going to work.
[9441.79s -> 9447.17s]  That's not going to work.
[9447.17s -> 9449.17s]  Nothing else is going to...
[9449.17s -> 9451.17s]  What do you have back here for me?
[9451.17s -> 9453.17s]  What do you have?
[9453.17s -> 9455.47s]  What the fuck?
[9455.47s -> 9458.93s]  What?
[9458.93s -> 9460.93s]  I can't even move these.
[9460.93s -> 9465.79s]  They're like in ten pieces.
[9465.79s -> 9468.66s]  Okay.
[9468.66s -> 9472.43s]  I don't...
[9472.43s -> 9474.80s]  Get all this out of the way.
[9474.80s -> 9488.93s]  Out. Out.
[9488.93s -> 9495.20s]  Get this out of the way.
[9495.20s -> 9497.20s]  Open the door so I can see what I'm doing.
[9497.20s -> 9501.92s]  Good.
[9501.92s -> 9505.18s]  Alright, what do I want to do?
[9505.18s -> 9508.19s]  Number one thing I want to do in the DIY room.
[9508.19s -> 9511.07s]  I think we take out one of these walls.
[9511.07s -> 9513.07s]  Yep.
[9513.07s -> 9516.19s]  This is a sledgehammer.
[9516.19s -> 9518.19s]  What do we got here?
[9518.19s -> 9521.71s]  Alright, this is good.
[9521.71s -> 9523.71s]  This is a saw.
[9523.71s -> 9525.71s]  I'm thinking right here. I think so.
[9525.71s -> 9528.66s]  What do you think?
[9528.66s -> 9532.62s]  Oh, right there.
[9532.62s -> 9534.62s]  I want an open bedroom concept
[9534.62s -> 9536.62s]  for my VR room.
[9536.62s -> 9549.22s]  I can't really...
[9549.22s -> 9558.54s]  What happened?
[9558.54s -> 9561.62s]  Why does it not work?
[9561.62s -> 9564.62s]  It's plugged in. What the fuck?
[9564.62s -> 9573.57s]  The saw is not working anymore.
[9573.57s -> 9575.57s]  I think there's an electrical problem.
[9575.57s -> 9577.57s]  The saw doesn't work.
[9577.57s -> 9579.57s]  The saw doesn't work.
[9579.57s -> 9582.51s]  Oh, shit.
[9582.51s -> 9585.46s]  That scared the shit out of me.
[9585.46s -> 9587.46s]  I can't get the saw to work.
[9587.46s -> 9589.46s]  I'm trying to figure it out.
[9589.46s -> 9591.76s]  Let me see if I can get this to work somehow.
[9594.64s -> 9596.64s]  It would lead to the fuse box, probably.
[9596.64s -> 9603.81s]  That's probably what's going on.
[9603.81s -> 9606.18s]  Where does this go? This goes somewhere.
[9606.18s -> 9608.42s]  It's taped down over here, but...
[9608.42s -> 9612.37s]  Hold on.
[9612.37s -> 9614.37s]  Why would it stop working?
[9614.37s -> 9616.80s]  I plugged it into the base downstairs.
[9616.80s -> 9618.80s]  I have like a whole unit that's down there.
[9618.80s -> 9620.80s]  There's like four or five extension cords that go out.
[9620.80s -> 9624.18s]  I don't know. I don't get it.
[9624.18s -> 9626.74s]  What is going on?
[9626.74s -> 9633.84s]  What the heck is this?
[9633.84s -> 9635.84s]  Who are you?
[9635.84s -> 9638.59s]  I'm your neighbor. I'm Jeff.
[9638.59s -> 9640.59s]  I live next door.
[9640.59s -> 9642.59s]  What are you doing with my electricity?
[9642.59s -> 9644.59s]  I plugged this into my unit downstairs.
[9644.59s -> 9646.59s]  What are you talking about?
[9646.59s -> 9648.59s]  No way. That thing's coming straight from my house.
[9648.59s -> 9650.59s]  You can follow it down the street.
[9650.59s -> 9652.59s]  Listen, when I grew up, that's called thievery.
[9652.59s -> 9654.59s]  I don't know what you think that is.
[9654.59s -> 9656.59s]  I saw a place to plug it in. I plugged it in.
[9656.59s -> 9658.59s]  I didn't know if it was yours or not.
[9658.59s -> 9660.59s]  You didn't check first.
[9660.59s -> 9662.59s]  I can just use them.
[9662.59s -> 9664.59s]  What is this place?
[9664.59s -> 9666.59s]  This is your plug?
[9666.59s -> 9668.59s]  Yes, my plug.
[9668.59s -> 9670.59s]  Which are you? 980?
[9670.59s -> 9672.59s]  I live down past Edna.
[9672.59s -> 9674.59s]  You met Ludwig?
[9674.59s -> 9676.59s]  Yeah.
[9676.59s -> 9678.59s]  It's crazy how many people live here.
[9678.59s -> 9680.59s]  It's weird.
[9680.59s -> 9682.59s]  Dollhouse Lane.
[9682.59s -> 9684.59s]  Listen, I'm going to need that back.
[9684.59s -> 9686.59s]  I'm working on a project up here.
[9686.59s -> 9688.59s]  It looks like it.
[9688.59s -> 9690.59s]  What are you doing?
[9690.59s -> 9692.59s]  That is not the right tool for the job.
[9692.59s -> 9694.59s]  I've got to tell you that.
[9694.59s -> 9696.59s]  That's not the right tool for the job.
[9696.59s -> 9698.59s]  That's for sure.
[9698.59s -> 9700.59s]  This is more confusing than
[9700.59s -> 9702.59s]  a fart in a fan factory.
[9702.59s -> 9704.59s]  Excuse me, Jeb.
[9708.59s -> 9710.59s]  Is that your electricity?
[9710.59s -> 9712.59s]  Yeah, electricity.
[9712.59s -> 9714.59s]  I haven't been taking it from you, have I?
[9714.59s -> 9716.59s]  We'll have to see.
[9716.59s -> 9718.59s]  My bill has been exceptionally high.
[9718.59s -> 9720.59s]  How high has your bill been?
[9720.59s -> 9722.59s]  A couple extra hundred.
[9722.59s -> 9724.59s]  Listen, my son has been doing
[9724.59s -> 9726.59s]  some weird things on the computer.
[9726.59s -> 9728.59s]  I figured it was something like that.
[9728.59s -> 9730.59s]  You never know.
[9732.59s -> 9734.59s]  I'll tell you what.
[9734.59s -> 9736.59s]  Are you keeping these?
[9736.59s -> 9738.59s]  These appeared last night.
[9738.59s -> 9740.59s]  I don't even know where they're from.
[9740.59s -> 9742.59s]  I don't mind.
[9742.59s -> 9744.59s]  Maybe just to pay for the electricity,
[9744.59s -> 9746.59s]  my pleasure.
[9746.59s -> 9748.59s]  I don't actually owe you any money.
[9748.59s -> 9750.59s]  The electricity is mine.
[9750.59s -> 9752.59s]  That's the thing.
[9752.59s -> 9754.59s]  I tried to get this to work.
[9754.59s -> 9756.59s]  The saw doesn't work.
[9756.59s -> 9758.59s]  The saw doesn't work.
[9758.59s -> 9760.59s]  Basic safety.
[9760.59s -> 9762.59s]  Let me show you a couple things.
[9762.59s -> 9764.59s]  My daddy taught me this.
[9764.59s -> 9766.59s]  He taught me two things.
[9766.59s -> 9768.59s]  NASCAR and how to fix stuff.
[9768.59s -> 9770.59s]  You know this stuff?
[9770.59s -> 9772.59s]  Exactly.
[9772.59s -> 9774.59s]  What can you tell me?
[9774.59s -> 9776.59s]  What should we do in this room?
[9776.59s -> 9778.59s]  Are you a handy guy?
[9778.59s -> 9780.59s]  Oh, for sure.
[9780.59s -> 9782.59s]  I would start for sure.
[9782.59s -> 9784.59s]  You've got to get some paint up on the walls.
[9784.59s -> 9786.59s]  Probably move some stuff around.
[9786.59s -> 9788.59s]  It's pretty dirty.
[9788.59s -> 9790.59s]  Tripping hazard.
[9790.59s -> 9792.59s]  Do you know this guy?
[9792.59s -> 9794.59s]  I've never seen him before in my life.
[9794.59s -> 9796.59s]  No idea.
[9796.59s -> 9798.59s]  Let me see if I can see where this is.
[9798.59s -> 9800.59s]  Is that you?
[9800.59s -> 9802.59s]  Kiteboga?
[9802.59s -> 9804.59s]  I don't know if you've heard of those people.
[9804.59s -> 9806.59s]  German985.com.
[9806.59s -> 9808.59s]  It seems like you have
[9808.59s -> 9810.59s]  literally no idea what you're doing.
[9810.59s -> 9812.59s]  Do you think we should start with painting?
[9812.59s -> 9814.59s]  Is that what you think?
[9814.59s -> 9816.59s]  The first thing we're going to have to do
[9816.59s -> 9818.59s]  is paint, absolutely.
[9818.59s -> 9820.59s]  Have you dusted the walls yet?
[9820.59s -> 9822.59s]  I've pre-dusted.
[9822.59s -> 9824.59s]  Have you checked for prints?
[9824.59s -> 9826.59s]  Yes.
[9826.59s -> 9828.59s]  Do you build this house yourself or do you move in?
[9828.59s -> 9830.59s]  You never know if it's a crime scene or something.
[9830.59s -> 9832.59s]  I woke up one day and I had a sling on my arm.
[9832.59s -> 9834.59s]  I walked over here and this was just here.
[9834.59s -> 9836.59s]  I just figured it was mine.
[9836.59s -> 9838.59s]  A sling on your arm?
[9838.59s -> 9840.59s]  I had a broken arm and I went through a window
[9840.59s -> 9842.59s]  a few weeks ago.
[9842.59s -> 9844.59s]  You went through a window?
[9844.59s -> 9846.59s]  Were you here when the fire happened?
[9846.59s -> 9848.59s]  I heard some sirens.
[9848.59s -> 9850.59s]  I think I called the fire department.
[9850.59s -> 9852.59s]  Is that you?
[9852.59s -> 9854.59s]  Thank God for you because I shattered my arm
[9854.59s -> 9856.59s]  but I'm fine.
[9856.59s -> 9858.59s]  Let me show you something here.
[9858.59s -> 9860.59s]  You've got the stools.
[9860.59s -> 9862.59s]  How about pink?
[9862.59s -> 9864.59s]  Does pink work for you?
[9864.59s -> 9866.59s]  I don't think it'll look good
[9866.59s -> 9868.59s]  but if that's what you want.
[9868.59s -> 9870.59s]  What wall do you think I should do for pink?
[9870.59s -> 9872.59s]  What wall?
[9872.59s -> 9874.59s]  What are you even doing in here?
[9874.59s -> 9876.59s]  This is going to be my VR room.
[9876.59s -> 9878.59s]  I want to be able to jump around in virtual reality.
[9878.59s -> 9880.59s]  What on earth is that?
[9880.59s -> 9882.59s]  Virtual reality.
[9882.59s -> 9884.59s]  You're getting a headset now.
[9884.59s -> 9886.59s]  I swear you kids have no clue what's going on.
[9886.59s -> 9888.59s]  Virtual reality?
[9888.59s -> 9890.59s]  What is that?
[9890.59s -> 9892.59s]  I know you probably smelled gas coming up here.
[9892.59s -> 9894.59s]  Gas?
[9894.59s -> 9896.59s]  Gasoline? It's me.
[9896.59s -> 9898.59s]  I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[9898.59s -> 9900.59s]  My smell ain't that great.
[9900.59s -> 9903.73s]  Gasoline.
[9903.73s -> 9905.73s]  You want to paint over all pink.
[9905.73s -> 9907.73s]  I want to paint pink.
[9907.73s -> 9909.73s]  For virtual reality.
[9909.73s -> 9911.73s]  I'm not quite sure what wall we're doing pink at the moment.
[9911.73s -> 9913.73s]  You got this wall here.
[9913.73s -> 9915.73s]  That's nice.
[9915.73s -> 9917.73s]  This pretty sturdy wall.
[9917.73s -> 9919.73s]  How about we do pink?
[9919.73s -> 9922.10s]  I need a tool to open this.
[9922.10s -> 9924.10s]  Have you tested these walls for stability?
[9924.10s -> 9926.10s]  Oh good lord.
[9926.10s -> 9929.42s]  I just like to do that.
[9929.42s -> 9931.42s]  Let me get this paint open.
[9931.42s -> 9933.42s]  You have no clue what you're doing.
[9933.42s -> 9935.42s]  Do you know how to open paint?
[9935.42s -> 9937.42s]  I've opened paint before.
[9937.42s -> 9939.42s]  I feel like it's a tuna can.
[9939.42s -> 9941.42s]  I've opened paint. I've opened tuna.
[9941.42s -> 9943.42s]  You live in the United States.
[9943.42s -> 9945.42s]  We had tuna sandwiches every day when we were kids.
[9947.42s -> 9949.42s]  You paint paint for virtual reality.
[9949.42s -> 9951.60s]  Why is that?
[9951.60s -> 9953.60s]  I just want to make sure I'm aware of this.
[9953.60s -> 9955.60s]  I would probably take off my shoes
[9955.60s -> 9957.60s]  if you don't want them to be covered in paint.
[9959.60s -> 9961.60s]  Let me get this straight.
[9961.60s -> 9963.60s]  You steal my electricity.
[9963.60s -> 9965.60s]  This is not stirred by the way.
[9965.60s -> 9967.60s]  How do I stir this?
[9967.60s -> 9969.60s]  Sit back and relax.
[9969.60s -> 9971.60s]  It's all intuitive.
[9971.60s -> 9973.60s]  You know what you're talking about.
[9973.60s -> 9975.60s]  I don't even know your name. Jeb?
[9975.60s -> 9978.99s]  Jeb.
[9978.99s -> 9980.99s]  Are you a painter?
[9980.99s -> 9982.99s]  Of course I am.
[9982.99s -> 9984.99s]  That looks pretty good.
[9984.99s -> 9986.99s]  You like that?
[9986.99s -> 9988.99s]  How long have you lived here for?
[9988.99s -> 9990.99s]  You can't even get on my floor!
[9990.99s -> 9992.99s]  I'm sorry about that.
[9992.99s -> 9994.99s]  I told you I know how to paint.
[9994.99s -> 9996.99s]  I didn't tell you I knew how to be cleanly.
[9996.99s -> 9998.99s]  Should we just dump it in here?
[9998.99s -> 10000.99s]  Yeah, I'd dump it.
[10000.99s -> 10002.99s]  Are you a handy person?
[10002.99s -> 10004.99s]  I got hands, yeah.
[10004.99s -> 10006.99s]  We'll make this work.
[10006.99s -> 10008.99s]  What wall are you putting it on?
[10008.99s -> 10010.99s]  The back wall.
[10010.99s -> 10012.99s]  East facing, north facing, south?
[10012.99s -> 10014.99s]  I don't know.
[10014.99s -> 10016.99s]  I don't have a compass.
[10016.99s -> 10018.99s]  It depends on where the moss grows.
[10018.99s -> 10020.99s]  You're a mess.
[10020.99s -> 10022.99s]  You're a waste.
[10022.99s -> 10024.99s]  Did you say a waste?
[10024.99s -> 10026.99s]  You're a big fat mistake.
[10026.99s -> 10028.99s]  I've never been more offended by someone
[10028.99s -> 10030.99s]  I've never met in my life.
[10030.99s -> 10032.99s]  I'm going for the back wall.
[10032.99s -> 10034.99s]  You're just going to paint now?
[10034.99s -> 10036.99s]  Yeah.
[10036.99s -> 10039.68s]  I have half a mind to leave right now.
[10039.68s -> 10041.68s]  He's painting your paint.
[10041.68s -> 10043.68s]  Do you think it looks good?
[10043.68s -> 10045.68s]  You've got to put more paint on.
[10045.68s -> 10047.68s]  Why don't you grab a brush and help me?
[10047.68s -> 10051.65s]  Why pink again?
[10051.65s -> 10053.65s]  Why pink?
[10053.65s -> 10055.65s]  Why are you doing pink?
[10055.65s -> 10057.65s]  Because the demons in my head told me to.
[10057.65s -> 10059.65s]  Okay, you're talking about Satan?
[10059.65s -> 10061.65s]  Well, it could be. I don't know.
[10061.65s -> 10063.65s]  I haven't figured it out yet.
[10063.65s -> 10065.65s]  You've got to do angled lines.
[10065.65s -> 10067.65s]  Do you go up and down or side to side?
[10067.65s -> 10069.65s]  You've got to go side to side or angles.
[10069.65s -> 10071.65s]  Better coverage.
[10071.65s -> 10073.65s]  I really do mean this.
[10073.65s -> 10075.65s]  This is not a joke.
[10075.65s -> 10077.65s]  This is not a joke for anything.
[10077.65s -> 10079.65s]  This is real life.
[10079.65s -> 10081.65s]  This is the first time I have ever
[10081.65s -> 10083.65s]  in my entire adult life,
[10083.65s -> 10085.65s]  in my entire childhood life
[10085.65s -> 10087.65s]  ever.
[10087.65s -> 10089.65s]  Congratulations, son.
[10089.65s -> 10094.26s]  There's a first time for everything.
[10094.26s -> 10096.26s]  We need to get on the ladder
[10096.26s -> 10098.26s]  to get the top of this, by the way.
[10098.26s -> 10100.26s]  Is that why you picked pink?
[10100.26s -> 10102.26s]  Because you've never painted before.
[10102.26s -> 10104.26s]  Or does it have something to do with virtual reality?
[10104.26s -> 10106.26s]  I just thought it was a cool color.
[10106.26s -> 10108.26s]  I thought it would look nice.
[10108.26s -> 10110.26s]  That looks pretty good.
[10110.26s -> 10112.26s]  You met my kids yet?
[10112.26s -> 10114.26s]  I smell.
[10114.26s -> 10116.26s]  It's making me gab.
[10116.26s -> 10118.26s]  I'm gabbing about it.
[10118.26s -> 10120.26s]  I smell so awful.
[10120.26s -> 10122.26s]  It smells like my bass boat.
[10122.26s -> 10124.26s]  I'm sorry. I really apologize that I smell this awful.
[10124.26s -> 10126.26s]  It's fine.
[10126.26s -> 10128.26s]  Look, it's the wood.
[10128.26s -> 10130.26s]  The wood emanates a disgusting onion and taco smell.
[10130.26s -> 10132.26s]  It definitely smells like something living.
[10132.26s -> 10134.26s]  It's coming from something living.
[10134.26s -> 10136.26s]  I'm really sorry about this.
[10136.26s -> 10138.26s]  I usually bathe at least once every day.
[10138.26s -> 10140.26s]  You live here alone, though?
[10140.26s -> 10142.26s]  Yeah.
[10142.26s -> 10144.26s]  I want to help you paint.
[10144.26s -> 10146.26s]  Eight days.
[10146.26s -> 10148.26s]  Is that right?
[10148.26s -> 10150.26s]  Yeah, I'm sorry. I have to tell you that.
[10150.26s -> 10152.26s]  That's okay. The pig's back in my yard.
[10152.26s -> 10154.26s]  Don't bathe either.
[10154.26s -> 10156.26s]  What are your piggies?
[10156.26s -> 10158.26s]  What the fuck would I say that to somebody in a public setting?
[10158.26s -> 10161.65s]  We still love them, though.
[10161.65s -> 10164.14s]  Is it what?
[10164.14s -> 10167.54s]  Is it pink or pank?
[10167.54s -> 10169.84s]  Is it pank or pink?
[10169.84s -> 10173.23s]  We're talking about pank balls.
[10173.23s -> 10176.56s]  You picked the color.
[10176.56s -> 10178.56s]  I was like, why are they saying that?
[10178.56s -> 10180.56s]  That's how we say it around here.
[10180.56s -> 10182.56s]  Pank balls.
[10182.56s -> 10184.56s]  Pank balls.
[10184.56s -> 10186.56s]  Excuse me, Jeb.
[10186.56s -> 10188.56s]  I appreciate the help.
[10188.56s -> 10190.56s]  I really do.
[10190.56s -> 10192.56s]  Thank you.
[10192.56s -> 10194.56s]  How do you say milk in these parts?
[10194.56s -> 10196.56s]  You know, if you're going to drink a glass of milk?
[10196.56s -> 10198.56s]  Say that again.
[10198.56s -> 10200.56s]  If you're going to drink a glass of milk,
[10200.56s -> 10202.56s]  what do you call it?
[10202.56s -> 10204.56s]  You know, Jeb,
[10204.56s -> 10206.56s]  I'm not really a big fan of the pink,
[10206.56s -> 10208.56s]  if I'm honest.
[10208.56s -> 10210.56s]  No?
[10210.56s -> 10212.56s]  I'm a pretty big fan of a black wall.
[10212.56s -> 10214.56s]  If you want to help me paint the wall black.
[10214.56s -> 10216.56s]  I've got a couple more minutes.
[10216.56s -> 10218.56s]  A couple more minutes.
[10218.56s -> 10220.56s]  I don't know what you're doing today or tomorrow,
[10220.56s -> 10222.56s]  but I really don't like the pink.
[10222.56s -> 10224.56s]  The pink doesn't pop for me.
[10224.56s -> 10226.56s]  I don't think my wife will miss me, if I'm honest.
[10226.56s -> 10228.56s]  Well, you live right at 980.
[10228.56s -> 10230.56s]  We need to paint this black.
[10230.56s -> 10232.56s]  It is getting kind of late, though.
[10232.56s -> 10234.56s]  We'll just be having it in a few minutes.
[10234.56s -> 10236.56s]  Is there food or nothing?
[10236.56s -> 10238.56s]  This food downstairs,
[10238.56s -> 10240.56s]  I know you came to my house completely uninvited.
[10240.56s -> 10242.56s]  Because you stole my electricity
[10242.56s -> 10244.56s]  just to throw it out there.
[10244.56s -> 10246.56s]  I didn't steal anything, actually.
[10246.56s -> 10248.56s]  I plugged my house
[10248.56s -> 10250.56s]  into an outlet that was on the street.
[10250.56s -> 10252.56s]  I thought it was a city outlet.
[10252.56s -> 10254.56s]  You thought it was a city outlet?
[10254.56s -> 10256.56s]  You pay taxes?
[10256.56s -> 10258.56s]  No, I haven't paid taxes in this city.
[10258.56s -> 10260.56s]  And you think the city is just going to give you electricity
[10260.56s -> 10262.56s]  for no reason?
[10262.56s -> 10264.56s]  Just pour right in there, okay?
[10266.56s -> 10268.56s]  That's where pink comes from.
[10271.44s -> 10273.44s]  Here, let me help you with that.
[10273.44s -> 10275.44s]  You do have a stench to you.
[10275.44s -> 10277.44s]  I'm sorry.
[10277.44s -> 10279.44s]  They won't let me take a shower for some reason.
[10279.44s -> 10281.44s]  Who's they? What are you talking about, they?
[10281.44s -> 10283.44s]  They're people that are here.
[10283.44s -> 10285.44s]  I know it's just you and me,
[10285.44s -> 10287.44s]  but there's like 60 fucking million people
[10287.44s -> 10289.44s]  that are watching and having me do something.
[10289.44s -> 10291.44s]  What are you talking about?
[10291.44s -> 10293.44s]  You mean like they're sending me in the walls?
[10293.44s -> 10295.44s]  Yeah.
[10295.44s -> 10297.44s]  I've been thinking there must be something to drink in the water as well.
[10297.44s -> 10299.44s]  I need to have another way to see what I'm doing.
[10299.44s -> 10301.44s]  You ever wake up at night
[10301.44s -> 10303.44s]  and just see random things,
[10303.44s -> 10305.44s]  like things flying in space, is that what you're referring to?
[10305.44s -> 10307.44s]  Yeah, Jeb.
[10307.44s -> 10309.44s]  What are you looking for?
[10309.44s -> 10311.44s]  I'm looking for screwdrivers.
[10311.44s -> 10313.44s]  There you go.
[10313.44s -> 10315.44s]  So you're saying you moved in.
[10315.44s -> 10317.44s]  I moved in.
[10317.44s -> 10319.44s]  Your house could be haunted, have you considered that?
[10319.44s -> 10321.44s]  Jeb, do you, like,
[10321.44s -> 10323.44s]  a very serious one-to-one, you and I.
[10323.44s -> 10325.44s]  Forget about anybody here.
[10325.44s -> 10327.44s]  There is literally no one here. It's a wall.
[10327.44s -> 10329.44s]  You don't even have a window right here.
[10329.44s -> 10331.44s]  One-to-wub, you and me, Jeb.
[10331.44s -> 10333.44s]  Are there,
[10333.44s -> 10335.44s]  is there like drug problems in this neighborhood?
[10335.44s -> 10337.44s]  Drug problems?
[10337.44s -> 10339.44s]  You're talking about like what kind of drugs in specific?
[10339.44s -> 10341.44s]  Like acetaminophen or
[10341.44s -> 10343.44s]  what are you talking about?
[10343.44s -> 10345.44s]  I don't know. I just feel like people are on crack
[10345.44s -> 10347.44s]  in this neighborhood.
[10347.44s -> 10349.44s]  Get that box out of the way, Jeb.
[10349.44s -> 10351.44s]  Yeah, sure. What's in here?
[10351.44s -> 10353.44s]  Why do you want me to move it?
[10353.44s -> 10355.44s]  Just kick it forward.
[10355.44s -> 10357.44s]  Just push it forward.
[10357.44s -> 10359.44s]  Yeah, just throw it off
[10359.44s -> 10361.44s]  into the bathroom.
[10361.44s -> 10363.44s]  Just push it over.
[10363.44s -> 10365.44s]  Just kick it. Doesn't matter.
[10365.44s -> 10368.77s]  There's a wall here, I don't understand.
[10368.77s -> 10370.77s]  Jeb, this is green!
[10370.77s -> 10372.77s]  This isn't even black!
[10372.77s -> 10374.77s]  This is green! This is green paint!
[10374.77s -> 10376.77s]  I told you you ain't good at this.
[10376.77s -> 10378.77s]  I really ain't good at this.
[10378.77s -> 10380.77s]  Jeb!
[10380.77s -> 10382.77s]  God damn it.
[10382.77s -> 10384.77s]  Is that black? Can you check?
[10384.77s -> 10386.77s]  We don't use words like that.
[10386.77s -> 10389.33s]  I'm sorry, Jeb.
[10389.33s -> 10391.33s]  Hold on.
[10391.33s -> 10393.33s]  You're really
[10393.33s -> 10395.33s]  going to take care of that stand
[10395.33s -> 10397.33s]  right now.
[10397.33s -> 10399.33s]  So you don't shower because people are
[10399.33s -> 10401.33s]  listening to you in your house.
[10401.33s -> 10403.33s]  I don't shower because they don't let me.
[10403.33s -> 10405.33s]  The ghosts tell you
[10405.33s -> 10407.33s]  not to take a shower.
[10407.33s -> 10409.33s]  You want to appease the ghosts
[10409.33s -> 10411.33s]  who think you're stinky.
[10411.33s -> 10413.33s]  Jeb, let me ask you another question.
[10413.33s -> 10415.33s]  Do you just wake up
[10415.33s -> 10417.33s]  with furniture in your house?
[10417.33s -> 10419.33s]  No, I pay for it because I have a job.
[10419.33s -> 10421.33s]  You ever thought about getting one of those?
[10421.33s -> 10423.33s]  Where do you think I got a house like this from?
[10423.33s -> 10425.33s]  Fair enough.
[10425.33s -> 10427.33s]  Excuse me.
[10427.33s -> 10429.33s]  I don't have any money.
[10429.33s -> 10431.33s]  I'm sorry, so you're saying
[10431.33s -> 10433.33s]  you want us to paint black over your
[10433.33s -> 10435.33s]  pink wall right there?
[10435.33s -> 10437.33s]  That's what I've been told from the
[10437.33s -> 10439.33s]  demons, Jeb.
[10439.33s -> 10441.33s]  I'll take care of it for you, alright?
[10441.33s -> 10443.33s]  Why don't you just clean up a little bit of your stain
[10443.33s -> 10445.33s]  or something? Just a tiny bit.
[10445.33s -> 10447.33s]  Can you guys please
[10447.33s -> 10449.33s]  do me a favor and just make it so we don't have to talk
[10449.33s -> 10451.33s]  about this every five seconds?
[10451.33s -> 10453.33s]  I'm filling the house with like human gas.
[10453.33s -> 10455.33s]  Like please just pick
[10455.33s -> 10457.70s]  shower.
[10457.70s -> 10459.70s]  We're painting the walls like pink and then black
[10459.70s -> 10461.70s]  and whatever. Please just pick it so he doesn't
[10461.70s -> 10463.70s]  trust it.
[10463.70s -> 10465.70s]  I told you I know how to do stuff in a house.
[10465.70s -> 10467.70s]  I'm not an interior designer.
[10467.70s -> 10469.70s]  What do you expect me to do here?
[10469.70s -> 10471.70s]  Black on the back wall.
[10471.70s -> 10473.70s]  Dip it in there?
[10473.70s -> 10475.70s]  Yes, just dip it in there black on the back wall.
[10475.70s -> 10477.70s]  My wife makes a mean turkey casserole.
[10477.70s -> 10479.70s]  She just takes mayonnaise and pretty much that's it.
[10482.38s -> 10484.38s]  That's it?
[10484.38s -> 10486.38s]  You just ruined the floor.
[10486.38s -> 10488.38s]  This is a very
[10488.38s -> 10490.38s]  significantly watered down
[10490.38s -> 10492.38s]  version of blank paint. I hope you understand.
[10492.38s -> 10494.38s]  I just want to get curious. I just want to make sure
[10494.38s -> 10496.38s]  I caught that correctly.
[10496.38s -> 10498.38s]  Turkey casserole, what's in it?
[10498.38s -> 10500.38s]  Listen, we're a big fan. You can make a casserole
[10500.38s -> 10502.38s]  out of anything.
[10502.38s -> 10504.56s]  A casserole out of anything with mayonnaise?
[10504.56s -> 10506.56s]  I just didn't wait
[10506.56s -> 10508.56s]  for it.
[10511.82s -> 10514.38s]  I think you made a new paint.
[10516.38s -> 10518.38s]  Listen, this is easy.
[10518.38s -> 10521.33s]  We'll just run back and forth.
[10521.33s -> 10523.33s]  Well, don't come over on my domain.
[10523.33s -> 10525.33s]  It is kind of fun though.
[10525.33s -> 10527.33s]  Do you want the ladder? We need to get up there too.
[10527.33s -> 10529.33s]  I mean, it's not bad.
[10529.33s -> 10531.33s]  Look, you can even draw on it. What's your name again?
[10531.33s -> 10533.33s]  My name is Jeffrey.
[10533.33s -> 10535.33s]  Jeffrey
[10535.33s -> 10537.33s]  900.
[10541.33s -> 10543.33s]  Thank God.
[10543.33s -> 10545.33s]  Good luck.
[10545.33s -> 10547.33s]  Just keep doing what you're doing.
[10547.33s -> 10549.33s]  I just have to shower.
[10549.33s -> 10551.33s]  Just do what you're doing.
[10551.33s -> 10556.19s]  This ain't my house.
[10556.19s -> 10559.25s]  Excuse me? Hello?
[10559.25s -> 10561.25s]  Are you coming back or
[10561.25s -> 10563.25s]  are you going to get like pizza or something or
[10563.25s -> 10567.47s]  mayonnaise?
[10567.47s -> 10569.47s]  Okay.
[10569.47s -> 10571.47s]  That's the wrong door again.
[10571.47s -> 10591.04s]  That's the wrong door again.
[10591.04s -> 10598.40s]  Taking a shower.
[10598.40s -> 10601.47s]  Mary's coming around the turn back
[10601.47s -> 10603.71s]  out there.
[10603.71s -> 10606.46s]  Wow.
[10606.46s -> 10608.46s]  Wow.
[10608.46s -> 10610.46s]  Do I brush my teeth four times a day?
[10610.46s -> 10612.46s]  Wow.
[10612.46s -> 10614.46s]  We don't need the pit stop.
[10614.46s -> 10620.16s]  We're going to NASCAR.
[10620.16s -> 10622.16s]  We're going to NASCAR.
[10622.16s -> 10625.23s]  That's so much better.
[10625.23s -> 10627.23s]  Oh my God, I smell like a dirty
[10627.23s -> 10629.23s]  gas-covered honey in my mouth.
[10631.23s -> 10633.23s]  I'm just embarrassing myself. People are
[10633.23s -> 10635.23s]  embarrassed to be in the same room with me.
[10635.23s -> 10637.23s]  People are embarrassed.
[10637.23s -> 10642.98s]  Okay, not bad.
[10642.98s -> 10660.00s]  Thank God.
[10660.00s -> 10662.00s]  I still feel like I smell.
[10662.00s -> 10664.00s]  You know when you take a shower, you feel like
[10664.00s -> 10666.88s]  not showering for three days, and you still
[10666.88s -> 10669.12s]  smell your armpits.
[10669.12s -> 10671.12s]  God, I need to do that every single day.
[10671.12s -> 10673.12s]  Put me down by the river.
[10673.12s -> 10675.12s]  Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
[10675.12s -> 10677.12s]  I NASCAR'd that sucker out there.
[10677.12s -> 10679.12s]  That looks great.
[10679.12s -> 10681.12s]  Thank you. Is that all you wanted?
[10681.12s -> 10683.12s]  This place don't look much better than when I got
[10683.12s -> 10685.12s]  here, I feel like.
[10685.12s -> 10687.12s]  That looks good. I kind of want to move this out of the way.
[10687.12s -> 10689.12s]  Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[10689.12s -> 10691.12s]  I almost just spanked my ankle.
[10691.12s -> 10693.12s]  I'm fine. I don't know much about safety.
[10693.12s -> 10695.12s]  What do you think about this wall, Jeff?
[10695.12s -> 10697.12s]  I mean, it doesn't look good.
[10697.12s -> 10699.12s]  I want to get...
[10699.12s -> 10701.12s]  Before you came into the house,
[10701.12s -> 10703.12s]  I wanted to get rid of this wall.
[10703.12s -> 10705.12s]  Oh, you're talking about that wall right there.
[10705.12s -> 10707.12s]  I don't want to be caught in the VR.
[10707.12s -> 10709.12s]  Yeah, that's the northeast south-facing wall.
[10709.12s -> 10711.12s]  North-northeast south-facing.
[10711.12s -> 10713.94s]  I mean, you could probably get
[10713.94s -> 10715.94s]  rid of it pretty easy.
[10715.94s -> 10717.94s]  Hold on, Jeff. I'm just going to take care of something.
[10717.94s -> 10721.33s]  You don't want to paint it or nothing?
[10721.33s -> 10723.33s]  Just give me a second. I'm just going to cover this.
[10723.33s -> 10725.33s]  No, I want to get rid of it. It's a VR room.
[10725.33s -> 10727.33s]  Okay. You've got a lot of paint around here.
[10730.21s -> 10732.21s]  Jeff, I've got to go get my robe on.
[10732.21s -> 10734.21s]  Your robe?
[10734.21s -> 10736.21s]  Can you please bring me some sort of food?
[10736.21s -> 10738.21s]  I mean, I've been here for what, like three days?
[10738.21s -> 10740.21s]  I'm just kidding.
[10740.21s -> 10742.21s]  Do you like cookies? Three hours. Cookies?
[10742.21s -> 10744.21s]  Do you like cookies? Yeah, P.K. and Sandy's. What do you got?
[10744.21s -> 10746.21s]  I like cookies. Molasses cookies.
[10746.21s -> 10748.21s]  Chocolate chip cookies. Mayonnaise cookies.
[10748.21s -> 10750.21s]  I like every kind of cookie, by the way.
[10750.21s -> 10752.21s]  Put your robe on.
[10752.21s -> 10754.21s]  What am I, like a 1940s billionaire?
[10754.21s -> 10756.21s]  Like, what are you talking about?
[10756.21s -> 10758.21s]  Put your robe on.
[10758.21s -> 10760.21s]  Put your robe on. What are you talking about?
[10760.21s -> 10763.47s]  I don't even know where it is. Where is it?
[10763.47s -> 10765.47s]  Let me see what he's got around here.
[10765.47s -> 10767.47s]  Must have taken that wall down, huh?
[10767.47s -> 10769.47s]  I'm like a playboy.
[10769.47s -> 10771.47s]  I don't even know where my robe is.
[10771.47s -> 10774.29s]  All right.
[10774.29s -> 10776.29s]  Hard day's work. That's what I'm talking about.
[10776.29s -> 10778.29s]  Hard day's work. I don't know who the robe is.
[10778.29s -> 10780.46s]  All right.
[10780.46s -> 10788.59s]  Oh.
[10788.59s -> 10801.18s]  Where is my robe?
[10801.18s -> 10806.94s]  Excuse me, Jeb.
[10806.94s -> 10808.94s]  Yeah, yeah.
[10808.94s -> 10810.94s]  You say you want to take that wall out, huh?
[10810.94s -> 10812.94s]  Do I want to take it down?
[10812.94s -> 10814.94s]  You want me to get started on that?
[10814.94s -> 10816.94s]  Are you literally going to do anything?
[10816.94s -> 10818.94s]  There are safety glasses there, Jeb.
[10818.94s -> 10820.94s]  Safety glasses?
[10820.94s -> 10827.26s]  I want this down.
[10827.26s -> 10829.26s]  So let me get this straight. You have safety glasses in this house.
[10829.26s -> 10831.26s]  Yeah.
[10831.26s -> 10833.26s]  But demons keep you up at night,
[10833.26s -> 10835.26s]  making you not shot.
[10835.26s -> 10837.26s]  It's like you're prepared for certain things.
[10837.26s -> 10839.26s]  Yeah. It don't make no sense.
[10839.26s -> 10841.26s]  Do you want to help or do you want to go home?
[10841.26s -> 10843.26s]  Now listen, I don't think you have any clue what you're doing.
[10843.26s -> 10845.26s]  I don't.
[10845.26s -> 10847.26s]  You ever demolish something before?
[10847.26s -> 10849.26s]  Get these off.
[10849.26s -> 10851.26s]  No, never. Never?
[10851.26s -> 10853.26s]  I've done a thing or two in my life.
[10853.26s -> 10855.26s]  If I do VR...
[10855.26s -> 10857.26s]  I don't want to bump into the wall
[10857.26s -> 10859.26s]  and like, oh, I'm doing VR.
[10859.26s -> 10861.26s]  Oh, shit, I hit the wall.
[10861.26s -> 10863.26s]  I think it has to come down.
[10863.26s -> 10865.26s]  Let's see if I can get it down.
[10865.26s -> 10867.26s]  Thor's hammer over here.
[10867.26s -> 10869.26s]  You look kind of funny with your robe on.
[10869.26s -> 10871.26s]  I'm not going to lie.
[10871.26s -> 10874.72s]  Hey, you're for real. You're taking that wall down.
[10874.72s -> 10876.72s]  Yeah.
[10876.72s -> 10878.72s]  It's got to come down.
[10878.72s -> 10880.72s]  You ever thought about pretending like you're on the back nine?
[10880.72s -> 10882.72s]  Like a golf swing?
[10882.72s -> 10884.72s]  Let me get a little bit of power into it.
[10884.72s -> 10886.72s]  That's not quite what I meant.
[10886.72s -> 10888.90s]  That's not a golf swing, my friend.
[10888.90s -> 10890.90s]  That was a golf swing.
[10890.90s -> 10892.90s]  Let me show you.
[10892.90s -> 10896.16s]  Hold on, let me get one more.
[10896.16s -> 10898.16s]  I'm going to just step over here for a second.
[10900.16s -> 10902.72s]  I just bounced off.
[10902.72s -> 10904.72s]  Would you like to try again?
[10904.72s -> 10906.72s]  Let me show you how you do it.
[10906.72s -> 10908.72s]  I'm talking about pretending you're on the back nine.
[10908.72s -> 10910.72s]  And you don't want to get back home, okay?
[10910.72s -> 10912.72s]  You don't want to get back home because you got a lot going on.
[10912.72s -> 10914.72s]  Let me just light up my shower really quick.
[10914.72s -> 10916.72s]  Okay.
[10916.72s -> 10920.74s]  Are you a putter or are you a driver?
[10920.74s -> 10922.74s]  You got another hammer or no?
[10922.74s -> 10924.74s]  No, I'm just watching you do this.
[10924.74s -> 10927.81s]  Okay.
[10927.81s -> 10929.81s]  You see that?
[10929.81s -> 10931.81s]  That was actually really good for not very much effort.
[10931.81s -> 10933.81s]  And then you can just go back and forth.
[10933.81s -> 10936.11s]  That's very good.
[10936.11s -> 10938.11s]  Very easy.
[10938.11s -> 10940.11s]  Hey Jeff, let me see that for a second.
[10940.11s -> 10946.19s]  Let me show you something.
[10946.19s -> 10951.31s]  Hey Jeff, get along with it.
[10951.31s -> 10953.31s]  I may have just sold my pants.
[10953.31s -> 10955.31s]  Hey Jeff, you want a swing?
[10955.31s -> 10957.31s]  I may have just sold my pants.
[10957.31s -> 10959.31s]  It's going to be more than one person stinking up this place right now.
[10959.31s -> 10962.06s]  I'll tell you that.
[10962.06s -> 10964.06s]  Go for a swing, Jeff.
[10964.06s -> 10966.06s]  I mean, you won't take the whole wall down.
[10966.06s -> 10968.06s]  I want it down. I don't want it there.
[10968.06s -> 10973.76s]  Are you sure about that?
[10973.76s -> 10975.76s]  See? Good.
[10975.76s -> 10977.76s]  How many more swings?
[10977.76s -> 10979.76s]  I don't know.
[10979.76s -> 10981.76s]  I want to do all the work for you.
[10981.76s -> 10983.76s]  I don't want to do everything.
[10983.76s -> 10985.76s]  That's for you. That's your house.
[10985.76s -> 10987.76s]  You hit it right up there in the quadrant?
[10987.76s -> 10989.76s]  Jerma.
[10989.76s -> 10991.76s]  You give me like two seconds just to hide.
[10991.76s -> 10993.76s]  Jerma, you're short.
[10993.76s -> 10995.76s]  Jerma, you're like five-five. No, I'm not. Fuck you.
[10995.76s -> 10997.76s]  You're like five-six. I'm fucking five-seven.
[10997.76s -> 10999.76s]  Idiot. Shut up. Fucking idiots.
[10999.76s -> 11001.76s]  Are you talking to me?
[11001.76s -> 11010.32s]  Yeah.
[11010.32s -> 11012.32s]  You're really digging that wall down, aren't you?
[11014.32s -> 11017.52s]  You hit it up right there, I think.
[11017.52s -> 11019.95s]  Yeah.
[11019.95s -> 11021.95s]  That's right. That's what I'm talking about.
[11021.95s -> 11023.95s]  You work out?
[11023.95s -> 11025.95s]  Not in five years. No? Okay.
[11025.95s -> 11028.38s]  Let's get this out of the way.
[11028.38s -> 11030.38s]  Can you get that out of there, Jeff?
[11030.38s -> 11032.38s]  Yeah.
[11032.38s -> 11034.38s]  Man, you really are stinky.
[11034.38s -> 11036.38s]  Or is that me?
[11036.38s -> 11038.38s]  I think that's you at this point because I took a shower.
[11038.38s -> 11040.38s]  That's not me.
[11040.38s -> 11042.38s]  I mean, I did soil myself.
[11042.38s -> 11044.38s]  I tell you what.
[11044.38s -> 11046.38s]  Why don't you hit around here
[11046.38s -> 11048.38s]  or something, okay? Give it the sweet touch.
[11048.38s -> 11050.38s]  Right here? Yeah. You wouldn't do it?
[11050.38s -> 11052.38s]  No, it's all you. It's your house.
[11052.38s -> 11054.38s]  Okay. How about right in the middle?
[11054.38s -> 11056.38s]  I feel significantly unsafe.
[11056.38s -> 11058.38s]  That's all I want to say.
[11058.38s -> 11060.38s]  What's it? Mario? You played Mario?
[11060.38s -> 11062.38s]  Whatever it is you're doing, I don't think.
[11062.38s -> 11064.38s]  Oh, so long,
[11064.38s -> 11066.38s]  you bouser!
[11066.38s -> 11075.47s]  Get down, you bastard!
[11075.47s -> 11078.74s]  Motherfucker!
[11078.74s -> 11080.74s]  You got a bunch of studs there.
[11080.74s -> 11082.74s]  Are there studs in the wall? Yeah.
[11082.74s -> 11084.74s]  What do we do about that? You're gonna have to take those down
[11084.74s -> 11086.74s]  at some point.
[11086.74s -> 11090.96s]  Let me use my hands.
[11090.96s -> 11092.96s]  Why don't you take a swing, Jeff?
[11092.96s -> 11094.96s]  Why don't you take a swing?
[11094.96s -> 11103.73s]  Oh, that's perfect!
[11103.73s -> 11106.93s]  We can...
[11106.93s -> 11108.93s]  Yeah, man. Oh, wowee!
[11108.93s -> 11110.93s]  I'm strong! Wowee!
[11110.93s -> 11112.93s]  You did that all by yourself?
[11112.93s -> 11115.23s]  Hold on, let me...
[11115.23s -> 11117.23s]  Hold on a second.
[11117.23s -> 11121.07s]  Sweet Lord.
[11121.07s -> 11123.07s]  I got you.
[11123.07s -> 11125.07s]  I got you.
[11128.14s -> 11130.14s]  Oh, Lord.
[11130.14s -> 11132.14s]  I'm gonna be feeling that for a while.
[11132.14s -> 11134.14s]  All right.
[11134.14s -> 11136.14s]  Okay, that ain't hard either.
[11136.14s -> 11138.14s]  What's left? What the heck is that thing?
[11138.14s -> 11140.14s]  What is it? Is it painting?
[11140.14s -> 11142.14s]  Yeah, you can probably get this down if you need to.
[11142.14s -> 11144.14s]  Can I get this down?
[11144.14s -> 11146.14s]  Watch out, Jeff.
[11146.14s -> 11148.14s]  No, please don't. Okay.
[11148.14s -> 11150.58s]  I'm at your house, man.
[11150.58s -> 11157.23s]  Yeah, so that's meant...
[11157.23s -> 11159.23s]  That's meant for structure. I don't think that's...
[11159.23s -> 11161.23s]  I would probably use the screwdriver.
[11161.23s -> 11163.23s]  You want to do that?
[11163.23s -> 11165.23s]  I would do it.
[11165.23s -> 11167.23s]  By the way, I asked for a cookie.
[11167.23s -> 11170.16s]  You're right.
[11170.16s -> 11174.45s]  He did ask for a cookie.
[11174.45s -> 11177.65s]  I'll get him a cookie, okay?
[11177.65s -> 11189.86s]  He asked for it. Fine.
[11189.86s -> 11194.13s]  Why is that down here?
[11194.13s -> 11203.22s]  Make no sense.
[11203.22s -> 11222.53s]  Just bringing him up.
[11222.53s -> 11224.53s]  Jeff, bring him up!
[11224.53s -> 11226.53s]  You want a cookie, you want food, of course.
[11226.53s -> 11230.82s]  Got to be a good neighbor.
[11230.82s -> 11232.82s]  Got to be a good neighbor!
[11232.82s -> 11238.38s]  Jeff!
[11238.38s -> 11240.69s]  How are you? How are you doing?
[11240.69s -> 11242.69s]  I've got some cookies for you.
[11242.69s -> 11244.69s]  Thank you. You make those yourself? Yes, I do.
[11244.69s -> 11246.69s]  It kind of looks like my mother made those.
[11246.69s -> 11248.69s]  Would you like one? Yeah, I wouldn't mind.
[11248.69s -> 11250.69s]  It kind of tastes like sand. I just didn't want to touch it
[11250.69s -> 11252.69s]  because I've been touching the ground.
[11252.69s -> 11254.69s]  I don't know if I should...
[11254.69s -> 11256.69s]  I'm not sure if I should eat with these hands or not.
[11256.69s -> 11258.69s]  Could you feed it to me?
[11258.69s -> 11261.82s]  Want to smell them? Yeah.
[11261.82s -> 11263.82s]  They smell great.
[11263.82s -> 11265.82s]  I'm sorry about that.
[11265.82s -> 11268.45s]  Oh, Lord.
[11268.45s -> 11270.45s]  Let me ask you something.
[11270.45s -> 11272.45s]  You built this house yourself or you bought it?
[11272.45s -> 11274.45s]  What's that?
[11274.45s -> 11276.45s]  You built this house yourself or you bought it?
[11276.45s -> 11278.45s]  I bought this house. It was upgraded a few times.
[11278.45s -> 11280.45s]  This is strange.
[11280.45s -> 11282.45s]  There's no reason to have this
[11282.45s -> 11284.45s]  in a closet.
[11284.45s -> 11286.45s]  And listen to this, right?
[11286.45s -> 11288.82s]  Yep.
[11288.82s -> 11290.82s]  This is not mine.
[11290.82s -> 11293.12s]  Look at this.
[11293.12s -> 11295.12s]  Holy shit. That is real weird.
[11295.12s -> 11297.36s]  Is there something behind here?
[11297.36s -> 11299.36s]  By the way, we might be able to take this down
[11299.36s -> 11301.36s]  but I am not sure to be honest with you.
[11301.36s -> 11303.36s]  Oh, okay.
[11303.36s -> 11305.36s]  I'm just going to step over.
[11305.36s -> 11307.36s]  Get this fucking thing down!
[11307.36s -> 11309.36s]  We can't get the door frame down.
[11315.33s -> 11317.33s]  I'm not sure about that.
[11317.33s -> 11319.33s]  There's a painting in here, Jeb.
[11319.33s -> 11321.33s]  Really interesting.
[11321.33s -> 11323.33s]  I want to see what's back there.
[11323.33s -> 11325.33s]  I don't know what that is.
[11325.33s -> 11327.33s]  I mean, the weird part is that whole painting
[11327.33s -> 11329.33s]  is kind of like stuck to the wall.
[11329.33s -> 11331.33s]  It's like glued.
[11331.33s -> 11333.33s]  It's like the previous owner put something there.
[11333.33s -> 11335.33s]  Hold on. Let me see. Can I cut it?
[11335.33s -> 11337.33s]  How old is this house?
[11337.33s -> 11339.33s]  Hold on. Can I cut through it?
[11339.33s -> 11341.82s]  You got to put a little more effort into it.
[11341.82s -> 11347.65s]  Have you ever used that in your life?
[11347.65s -> 11349.65s]  I've never used one of these before.
[11349.65s -> 11351.65s]  I mean, in real life either.
[11351.65s -> 11353.65s]  Okay. First time for everything. That's all right.
[11353.65s -> 11358.18s]  Okay.
[11358.18s -> 11360.18s]  Why would there be a painting back here?
[11360.18s -> 11362.74s]  I mean, I guess it could be some sort of
[11362.74s -> 11364.74s]  shrine. Jeb.
[11364.74s -> 11366.74s]  You did say there were demons in the house.
[11366.74s -> 11369.68s]  Give me the sledgehammer. Okay.
[11369.68s -> 11371.68s]  You did say there were demons in the house.
[11371.68s -> 11373.68s]  Maybe someone was trying to do some sort of, you know.
[11373.68s -> 11375.68s]  Jeb, give me the sledgehammer. Okay, I'm going to walk away now.
[11375.68s -> 11381.25s]  You going to give a little force to it?
[11381.25s -> 11385.28s]  Jeb.
[11385.28s -> 11391.74s]  Okay, you're not really good at that.
[11391.74s -> 11393.74s]  There's definitely something back here, Jeb.
[11393.74s -> 11397.65s]  What do you think's back there?
[11397.65s -> 11399.65s]  It's made of steel.
[11399.65s -> 11402.66s]  Are you kidding me?
[11402.66s -> 11404.66s]  Holy shit, there are screws here. Hold on.
[11404.66s -> 11408.05s]  Okay.
[11408.05s -> 11410.05s]  There's that too.
[11410.05s -> 11412.05s]  I mean, you really can't cut that.
[11412.05s -> 11414.05s]  I'm scared.
[11414.05s -> 11416.05s]  Have you ever been to the dentist, Jeb?
[11416.05s -> 11418.05s]  I have never been. No thank you.
[11418.05s -> 11421.89s]  No thank you.
[11421.89s -> 11423.89s]  All right.
[11423.89s -> 11426.26s]  That's the wrong way.
[11426.26s -> 11428.26s]  I bet you could cut through it if you'd like.
[11428.26s -> 11430.26s]  Jeb, how do you get this to go in reverse?
[11430.26s -> 11432.26s]  Let me see. You go ahead and try.
[11432.26s -> 11434.26s]  I'll take care of everything for you.
[11434.26s -> 11436.26s]  Can it go in reverse?
[11436.26s -> 11438.26s]  Yeah, this is the wrong thing. That ain't going to work.
[11438.26s -> 11440.26s]  Okay, I'll tell you what.
[11440.26s -> 11442.26s]  Where's that knife?
[11442.26s -> 11444.26s]  Jeb, be careful. It's hard to cut through.
[11444.26s -> 11446.26s]  I'll be careful, all right?
[11446.26s -> 11448.26s]  Jeb, be very careful.
[11448.26s -> 11450.26s]  It's a very sharp knife. Thank you, my liege.
[11450.26s -> 11452.26s]  Be careful.
[11452.26s -> 11454.26s]  So you moved here, how long ago?
[11454.26s -> 11456.26s]  A week ago, two weeks ago.
[11456.26s -> 11458.26s]  Are you married at all? No.
[11458.26s -> 11460.26s]  I've never been married, not married.
[11460.26s -> 11462.26s]  Okay, why not?
[11462.26s -> 11464.26s]  Because I'm not ready yet.
[11464.26s -> 11466.26s]  You know, somebody asked me the same question
[11466.26s -> 11468.26s]  a week ago, the same exact thing.
[11468.26s -> 11470.26s]  The sleep demons are telling you something?
[11470.26s -> 11472.26s]  No, somebody that may even be part of your family.
[11472.26s -> 11474.26s]  I don't know.
[11474.26s -> 11476.26s]  Excuse me?
[11476.26s -> 11478.26s]  Just focus on that. It's a very sharp blade.
[11478.26s -> 11480.26s]  Sorry, I've done this a couple times.
[11480.26s -> 11482.26s]  Unfortunately.
[11482.26s -> 11484.26s]  This is the most sturdy painting.
[11484.26s -> 11486.26s]  There's been a few times in my life
[11486.26s -> 11488.26s]  that I've had to take down a painting
[11488.26s -> 11490.26s]  via a razor blade.
[11490.26s -> 11492.26s]  We're almost done. I'm going to let you do the...
[11492.26s -> 11494.26s]  You got it? I'm going to let you do most of the work.
[11494.26s -> 11496.26s]  Okay.
[11496.26s -> 11498.26s]  Looks good. You seen the fitness...
[11498.26s -> 11500.26s]  Instructor?
[11500.26s -> 11502.26s]  Yeah, you might want to do that.
[11502.26s -> 11504.26s]  Has he gone in your house? Oh, yeah.
[11504.26s -> 11506.26s]  He goes in your house, too?
[11506.26s -> 11508.26s]  Why do you let him do that?
[11508.26s -> 11510.26s]  That's like his own home invasion.
[11510.26s -> 11512.26s]  You didn't sign the HOA?
[11512.26s -> 11514.26s]  No, what HOA?
[11514.26s -> 11516.26s]  Let me see that knife.
[11516.26s -> 11518.26s]  You want the knife? Yeah.
[11518.26s -> 11520.26s]  There you are. I want to get this away from everybody.
[11520.26s -> 11522.26s]  Oh, I understand.
[11522.26s -> 11524.26s]  Can we get in there? Yeah, let me see.
[11524.26s -> 11526.26s]  There's something back here, I think.
[11526.26s -> 11528.26s]  There's something...
[11528.26s -> 11530.26s]  Good Lord.
[11530.26s -> 11537.04s]  Holy shit!
[11537.04s -> 11539.04s]  What is that?
[11539.04s -> 11541.04s]  What is this?
[11541.04s -> 11543.04s]  There's a safe back here?
[11543.04s -> 11545.04s]  What is that?
[11545.04s -> 11547.04s]  You said you bought this house?
[11547.04s -> 11549.04s]  Okay.
[11549.04s -> 11551.04s]  Oh, my God! It's a safe!
[11551.04s -> 11553.04s]  You know how to get that open or not?
[11553.04s -> 11555.04s]  I don't know the code! Hold on, let me try.
[11555.04s -> 11561.38s]  Okay.
[11561.38s -> 11563.38s]  Let me just double-check. Have you ever opened a safe before?
[11563.38s -> 11565.38s]  Because I'm finding there are a significant number of things
[11565.38s -> 11567.38s]  you've never done. I watch YouTube videos that can explain it.
[11567.38s -> 11569.38s]  You listen for the little...
[11569.38s -> 11572.26s]  Okay. You hear that?
[11572.26s -> 11574.26s]  Right there?
[11574.26s -> 11576.26s]  Okay.
[11576.26s -> 11578.26s]  Yeah, I don't hear nothing. I can't get it.
[11578.26s -> 11580.50s]  You could sledgehammer it.
[11580.50s -> 11582.50s]  Maybe.
[11582.50s -> 11584.50s]  I do know a guy.
[11584.50s -> 11586.50s]  I swear to God, this house was built five days ago.
[11586.50s -> 11588.50s]  That's weird.
[11588.50s -> 11590.50s]  Okay, I may accept to you. I know a guy.
[11590.50s -> 11592.50s]  If you need help. I know a locksmith who can call.
[11592.50s -> 11594.50s]  You know a guy?
[11594.50s -> 11596.50s]  I know a guy. I got a guy for everything.
[11596.50s -> 11598.50s]  We could break it, too.
[11598.50s -> 11600.50s]  You want to try? We could.
[11600.50s -> 11602.50s]  Listen, I don't have a significant amount of confidence
[11602.50s -> 11604.50s]  that you're going to be able to break that safe
[11604.50s -> 11606.50s]  if you couldn't break that wall down.
[11606.50s -> 11608.50s]  But that's just me.
[11608.50s -> 11610.50s]  That's all right.
[11610.50s -> 11612.50s]  If you want to give it a shot.
[11612.50s -> 11614.50s]  Give your guy a call.
[11614.50s -> 11616.50s]  Can I borrow your phone though?
[11616.50s -> 11618.50s]  It's downstairs.
[11618.50s -> 11620.50s]  It's down in the kitchen.
[11620.50s -> 11622.50s]  You know a guy that can come do this?
[11622.50s -> 11626.46s]  Yeah, give me two seconds.
[11626.46s -> 11628.46s]  He knows a guy.
[11628.46s -> 11632.30s]  To open the safe?
[11632.30s -> 11634.99s]  I don't know what's in it.
[11634.99s -> 11636.99s]  This is an upgrade.
[11636.99s -> 11638.99s]  I didn't know this was even in here.
[11638.99s -> 11640.99s]  Was this part of the foundation?
[11640.99s -> 11642.99s]  What are you, stupid?
[11642.99s -> 11644.99s]  We're like on a second story.
[11646.99s -> 11654.35s]  He knows a guy. Call him.
[11654.35s -> 11656.35s]  I think people like tools because of the sounds they make.
[11656.35s -> 11658.35s]  You think that, too?
[11658.35s -> 11660.35s]  You guys think that, too?
[11660.35s -> 11662.35s]  You know what I mean? It's like, oh yeah, let me get my tool.
[11662.35s -> 11664.98s]  It feels very like
[11664.98s -> 11666.98s]  manly.
[11666.98s -> 11668.98s]  Like, oh yeah, let me get my tool.
[11668.98s -> 11670.98s]  How you doing, man?
[11670.98s -> 11672.98s]  Okay, you're not busy right now.
[11672.98s -> 11674.98s]  Listen, I got a thing or two
[11674.98s -> 11676.98s]  to get taken care of.
[11676.98s -> 11679.92s]  You want to come on down, get her down?
[11679.92s -> 11681.92s]  Yeah, come on over pronto.
[11681.92s -> 11683.92s]  I got a little bit of a situation I could use your help with.
[11683.92s -> 11685.92s]  Okay?
[11685.92s -> 11687.92s]  Yeah. No problem.
[11687.92s -> 11689.92s]  Okay.
[11689.92s -> 11699.52s]  America, alright.
[11699.52s -> 11709.70s]  I can't get in. I don't know the combo.
[11709.70s -> 11711.70s]  Hey, can you get the door?
[11711.70s -> 11713.70s]  Yeah, I got you.
[11713.70s -> 11715.70s]  If it's your guy, I don't want to
[11715.70s -> 11718.77s]  greet him. You know him.
[11718.77s -> 11721.20s]  Come on in.
[11721.20s -> 11724.08s]  Hey, Jeff.
[11724.08s -> 11726.08s]  Hey, how's it going, my guy?
[11726.08s -> 11728.08s]  Good to see you. Oh, you are a blue collar as always.
[11728.08s -> 11730.08s]  Come on in, come on in.
[11730.08s -> 11732.08s]  Listen, if you could keep this on the
[11732.08s -> 11734.08s]  down low, alright, I got a safe situation
[11734.08s -> 11736.08s]  up there. I need someone to crack it.
[11736.08s -> 11738.08s]  I want to make sure that, I'll make sure
[11738.08s -> 11740.08s]  you get paid, if you know what I mean. Sure.
[11740.08s -> 11742.08s]  Yeah, alright. Let's head upstairs.
[11742.08s -> 11744.08s]  I think for you, Jeff. Thank you, brother.
[11744.08s -> 11746.08s]  It's not your place, right? Down the street.
[11746.08s -> 11748.08s]  Oh, no, no, no, not for sure.
[11748.08s -> 11750.08s]  Keep going, keep going.
[11751.08s -> 11753.08s]  It's an confusing layout.
[11753.08s -> 11755.08s]  I'm going to tell you right now. That makes no fucking sense.
[11755.08s -> 11757.08s]  That makes zero sense.
[11757.08s -> 11759.08s]  He's trying to paint his wall pink
[11759.08s -> 11761.08s]  and black, pink up there.
[11761.08s -> 11763.08s]  That sounds dumb. You can go up the stairs.
[11763.08s -> 11765.08s]  It could be gems, jewels,
[11765.08s -> 11767.08s]  gold, there might be gold in there.
[11767.08s -> 11769.26s]  Gold still expensive.
[11769.26s -> 11772.01s]  If it's gold,
[11772.01s -> 11774.01s]  that's awesome.
[11774.01s -> 11776.01s]  Who would put a safe in a wall? That's ridiculous.
[11778.01s -> 11780.01s]  Why would you put a safe in a wall?
[11780.01s -> 11782.50s]  Unless it was to hide something very, very important.
[11782.50s -> 11784.50s]  Hey. What?
[11784.50s -> 11786.94s]  How are you?
[11786.94s -> 11788.94s]  What the fuck is this? A little bit of a war zone up here.
[11788.94s -> 11790.94s]  We swear, when we come in a room.
[11790.94s -> 11792.94s]  Okay. Alright.
[11792.94s -> 11794.94s]  This is my guy. That's your guy?
[11794.94s -> 11796.94s]  He can take care of pretty much anything.
[11796.94s -> 11798.94s]  What's your name? What's up?
[11798.94s -> 11800.94s]  I'm a locksmith. He doesn't need to know, right?
[11800.94s -> 11802.94s]  You're good.
[11802.94s -> 11804.94s]  We have a safe here.
[11804.94s -> 11806.94s]  I didn't want to break it, didn't want to swing at it or anything.
[11806.94s -> 11808.94s]  But it's here.
[11808.94s -> 11810.94s]  I just, can you get into this?
[11810.94s -> 11812.94s]  For the record, have you tried to get into it while I was gone?
[11812.94s -> 11814.94s]  I tried.
[11814.94s -> 11816.94s]  Why would I know a combination of a safe? I don't know.
[11816.94s -> 11818.94s]  Since you say, this should be pretty standard.
[11818.94s -> 11820.94s]  Was it behind anything?
[11820.94s -> 11822.94s]  It was a painting and a wall.
[11822.94s -> 11824.94s]  He's a neighbor.
[11824.94s -> 11827.18s]  Religious.
[11827.18s -> 11829.35s]  Does it mean anything?
[11829.35s -> 11831.35s]  Does it give you insight?
[11831.35s -> 11833.35s]  Does it mean anything?
[11833.35s -> 11835.35s]  Can you just let me?
[11835.35s -> 11837.35s]  You can stick the painting, something.
[11837.35s -> 11839.35s]  Listen, do you...
[11839.35s -> 11841.35s]  That's a hot locksmith.
[11841.35s -> 11843.35s]  I just want to make sure that's clear.
[11843.35s -> 11845.35s]  What's up?
[11845.35s -> 11847.35s]  You called over one of the most attractive locksmiths I've ever met in my whole life.
[11847.35s -> 11849.35s]  I just want to know.
[11849.35s -> 11851.35s]  He's a good looking man.
[11851.35s -> 11853.35s]  Can you not come on to me? I'm trying to do my job. Appreciate that.
[11853.35s -> 11855.35s]  Just keep doing what you're doing.
[11855.35s -> 11857.35s]  It's like an ocean violation.
[11857.35s -> 11859.35s]  He's really, really sweet.
[11859.35s -> 11861.35s]  How many days did Moses ride the boat?
[11861.35s -> 11863.35s]  How long was the rain?
[11863.35s -> 11865.35s]  A week.
[11865.35s -> 11867.35s]  The rain?
[11867.35s -> 11869.35s]  Forty days and forty nights.
[11869.35s -> 11871.35s]  Forty days and forty nights.
[11871.35s -> 11873.35s]  What's the time frame on you getting into that?
[11873.35s -> 11875.35s]  Safe.
[11875.35s -> 11877.35s]  Are you rushing me?
[11877.35s -> 11879.35s]  No, I just was curious. I don't know how long it took.
[11879.35s -> 11881.35s]  Okay, well I hope he gets it.
[11881.35s -> 11883.35s]  I'm going to ask you a quick question.
[11883.35s -> 11885.35s]  Are you familiar with the idea that
[11885.35s -> 11887.35s]  possession is nine-tenths of the law?
[11887.35s -> 11889.35s]  You're going to have to say that again
[11889.35s -> 11891.35s]  and explain like I'm five.
[11891.35s -> 11893.35s]  They say
[11893.35s -> 11895.35s]  possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[11895.35s -> 11897.35s]  You understand that?
[11897.35s -> 11899.35s]  Okay, so conceptually it would mean
[11899.35s -> 11901.35s]  you know what nine-tenths is?
[11901.35s -> 11903.35s]  It means nine out of ten.
[11903.35s -> 11905.35s]  Hold on.
[11905.35s -> 11907.35s]  How many percentages is that?
[11907.35s -> 11909.59s]  I think here's the point.
[11909.59s -> 11911.59s]  Whoever has what's in that safe
[11911.59s -> 11913.59s]  owns it.
[11913.59s -> 11915.59s]  You understand?
[11915.59s -> 11918.92s]  You're just making no sense to me.
[11918.92s -> 11920.92s]  I can't get it.
[11920.92s -> 11922.92s]  What do you mean you can't get it? I'm fucking with you. I'm the best.
[11922.92s -> 11924.92s]  Okay.
[11924.92s -> 11926.92s]  You want to get in there?
[11926.92s -> 11928.92s]  What's in it?
[11928.92s -> 11930.92s]  Okay, okay.
[11930.92s -> 11932.92s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11932.92s -> 11934.92s]  Wait a second. Wait a minute.
[11934.92s -> 11936.92s]  We have to have a conversation.
[11936.92s -> 11938.92s]  Let me see that.
[11938.92s -> 11940.92s]  Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[11940.92s -> 11942.92s]  No, I have no clue.
[11942.92s -> 11944.92s]  You got the safe open.
[11944.92s -> 11946.92s]  It's a pleasure to work with you as well.
[11946.92s -> 11948.92s]  You got the safe open.
[11948.92s -> 11950.92s]  You got the safe open.
[11950.92s -> 11952.92s]  Thank you. Let me see what's in there.
[11952.92s -> 11954.92s]  What if we just figure out payment?
[11954.92s -> 11956.92s]  Let me see what's in the safe.
[11956.92s -> 11958.92s]  Let me see what's in the safe.
[11958.92s -> 11960.92s]  Get downstairs now.
[11960.92s -> 11962.92s]  Why are we going downstairs?
[11962.92s -> 11964.92s]  I want everybody out of this room because I don't want to be up here.
[11964.92s -> 11966.92s]  Get downstairs.
[11966.92s -> 11968.92s]  You might want to pocket some of that.
[11968.92s -> 11970.92s]  It's my goddamn house. Whatever's in the wall is mine.
[11970.92s -> 11972.92s]  That's absolute bullshit.
[11972.92s -> 11974.92s]  I'm not comfortable with you touching
[11974.92s -> 11976.92s]  all of the stuff that's in a
[11976.92s -> 11978.92s]  wall in my house.
[11978.92s -> 11980.92s]  You didn't even know it was there, though.
[11980.92s -> 11982.92s]  It's my house, so you took it from my house.
[11982.92s -> 11984.92s]  He didn't build this house.
[11984.92s -> 11986.92s]  I don't believe in private property, actually.
[11986.92s -> 11988.92s]  He didn't build this house. Hallelujah, brother.
[11988.92s -> 11990.92s]  Hold on.
[11990.92s -> 11992.92s]  Let's get an ad break.
[11992.92s -> 11994.92s]  Ad break. I want to get this sorted.
[11994.92s -> 11996.92s]  I'm sorry. What did you say?
[11996.92s -> 11998.92s]  Just go into the kitchen.
[11998.92s -> 12000.92s]  What is this guy talking about?
[12000.92s -> 12002.92s]  Ad break now.
[12002.92s -> 12004.92s]  We're going to sort this.
[12004.92s -> 12420.47s]  Don't hand people money that didn't do it.
[12420.47s -> 12422.47s]  I wanted to go over a couple of things
[12422.47s -> 12424.47s]  kind of off camera
[12424.47s -> 12426.47s]  with just no
[12426.47s -> 12428.47s]  jokes or anything.
[12428.47s -> 12430.47s]  I want to talk about the show and how it
[12430.47s -> 12432.47s]  even was able to happen in the first place.
[12432.47s -> 12434.47s]  Coinbase
[12434.47s -> 12436.47s]  came in at the last second
[12436.47s -> 12438.47s]  and let us be able
[12438.47s -> 12440.65s]  to do the show.
[12440.65s -> 12442.65s]  When I say that, I mean
[12442.65s -> 12444.65s]  that. All the things you see
[12444.65s -> 12446.65s]  back here were really only possible
[12446.65s -> 12448.65s]  because of this company here.
[12448.65s -> 12450.65s]  I really mean that. I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.
[12450.65s -> 12452.65s]  Twitch came in
[12452.65s -> 12454.65s]  and gave us a bunch of money. Coinbase gave us
[12454.65s -> 12456.65s]  a bunch of money.
[12456.65s -> 12458.65s]  What you see here is only because of those
[12458.65s -> 12460.65s]  two companies.
[12460.65s -> 12462.65s]  I couldn't afford any of this stuff.
[12462.65s -> 12464.65s]  There's no way I could have done any of this on my own.
[12466.65s -> 12468.65s]  When you talk about sponsorships,
[12468.65s -> 12470.65s]  talk about sponsors,
[12470.65s -> 12472.65s]  you've seen the show.
[12472.65s -> 12474.65s]  They've let us do whatever we want.
[12474.65s -> 12476.65s]  We didn't have to do anything.
[12476.65s -> 12478.65s]  Twitch and Coinbase,
[12478.65s -> 12481.53s]  they just let us do what we wanted.
[12481.53s -> 12483.53s]  I've used Coinbase
[12483.53s -> 12485.53s]  for the last five years.
[12485.53s -> 12487.53s]  Those of you who know this channel, I used to have an Ethereum
[12487.53s -> 12489.53s]  address that you could donate to.
[12489.53s -> 12492.09s]  It was real.
[12492.09s -> 12494.09s]  I have to thank them because without their support,
[12494.09s -> 12496.84s]  the show doesn't happen.
[12496.84s -> 12498.84s]  It doesn't happen without them.
[12498.84s -> 12500.84s]  Also, there's so many people to thank.
[12500.84s -> 12502.84s]  We're not going to have that much opportunity to thank everybody,
[12502.84s -> 12505.21s]  but seriously, I'm going to take the opportunity now.
[12505.21s -> 12507.21s]  But seriously, if you're into cryptocurrency,
[12507.21s -> 12509.21s]  if you want to learn more about the space,
[12509.21s -> 12511.21s]  it's a great place to start.
[12511.21s -> 12513.21s]  They gave us a significant amount of capital
[12513.21s -> 12515.21s]  to make this show happen.
[12515.21s -> 12517.21s]  Thank you, Coinbase. Thank you, Twitch.
[12517.21s -> 12519.21s]  Also, while I have a second here,
[12519.21s -> 12522.15s]  because this is the finale,
[12522.15s -> 12524.15s]  JK Productions, Community Jake,
[12524.15s -> 12526.46s]  this is impossible
[12526.46s -> 12528.46s]  without these people.
[12528.46s -> 12530.70s]  Andy Mark, Ghost Commander, Criken and his team,
[12530.70s -> 12533.26s]  this went off without a hitch.
[12536.14s -> 12538.14s]  It's seriously, sure, this is the idea
[12538.14s -> 12540.14s]  that I came up with, but you can't do this
[12540.14s -> 12542.31s]  without a ton of dedicated people.
[12542.31s -> 12544.81s]  The glass breaking, when we did that,
[12544.81s -> 12548.52s]  Andy Mark, the engineers in Andy Mark
[12548.52s -> 12550.52s]  came up with all this stuff.
[12550.52s -> 12553.45s]  There's so many people, Ludwig, Kit Boga,
[12553.45s -> 12555.45s]  Milton,
[12555.45s -> 12557.45s]  there's so many people back here that you don't see.
[12557.45s -> 12559.75s]  I wanted just to kind of address it real quick
[12559.75s -> 12562.25s]  because I wasn't going to have an opportunity to.
[12562.25s -> 12566.15s]  But again, I want to
[12566.15s -> 12568.15s]  focus on, there's so many people
[12568.15s -> 12570.58s]  to thank, there's so many people that made this happen,
[12570.58s -> 12572.58s]  but Coinbase,
[12572.58s -> 12574.89s]  go check them out, please do.
[12574.89s -> 12576.89s]  They gave us so much money to do this
[12576.89s -> 12578.89s]  and they just wanted to make a good show.
[12578.89s -> 12581.38s]  They wanted to make a good show.
[12581.38s -> 12583.38s]  And I think it has been. I think it's been a lot of fun.
[12583.38s -> 12585.75s]  So that's because of Twitch
[12585.75s -> 12587.75s]  and Coinbase. Thank you, both of you.
[12587.75s -> 12589.75s]  We'll go back to the show.
[12589.75s -> 12591.75s]  I've actually used Coinbase, I really have,
[12591.75s -> 12594.31s]  for five years.
[12594.31s -> 12597.06s]  I mean it. And I'll go back to the show, let's break the fourth one.
[12597.06s -> 12609.54s]  What's going on in here?
[12609.54s -> 12615.37s]  I thought that was a bug.
[12615.37s -> 12618.38s]  I told you to put that thing down.
[12618.38s -> 12621.64s]  Have you guys heard anything in the back?
[12621.64s -> 12624.01s]  I was just kind of back there just messing around a little bit.
[12624.01s -> 12626.01s]  Sure. We were just talking, I mean.
[12626.01s -> 12628.01s]  Yeah, you've got quite a bit of money here.
[12628.01s -> 12630.63s]  You've got quite a bit of money.
[12630.63s -> 12632.63s]  So, hypothetically speaking, we were thinking
[12632.63s -> 12634.63s]  we could make this whole thing go away.
[12634.63s -> 12636.63s]  Can I hold that?
[12636.63s -> 12638.63s]  I was talking to Jeb
[12638.63s -> 12640.63s]  and I figured we'd just split it, you know,
[12640.63s -> 12642.63s]  maybe three way.
[12642.63s -> 12644.63s]  Me, Jeb, and he has actually a dog
[12644.63s -> 12646.63s]  named Buck. You're going to do a three way
[12646.63s -> 12648.63s]  split? Between the three of us?
[12648.63s -> 12650.63s]  It's in my wall.
[12650.63s -> 12652.63s]  Who wouldn't have gotten in?
[12652.63s -> 12654.63s]  Let me count how much money this is.
[12654.63s -> 12656.63s]  I mean, hypothetically speaking, if we were to have taken the money
[12656.63s -> 12658.63s]  and walked away, no one would believe you.
[12658.63s -> 12660.63s]  We were honest. We should get honest money.
[12660.63s -> 12662.63s]  It's 1200 bucks.
[12662.63s -> 12664.63s]  That's pretty bad math.
[12664.63s -> 12666.63s]  We counted it when you were gone.
[12666.63s -> 12668.63s]  I didn't get much beyond the sixth grade
[12668.63s -> 12670.63s]  and I can tell you that ain't 1200 bucks.
[12672.63s -> 12674.63s]  From what you've done,
[12674.63s -> 12676.63s]  blue collar wise, you seem
[12676.63s -> 12678.63s]  to be quite slow
[12678.63s -> 12680.63s]  What?
[12680.63s -> 12682.63s]  The painting.
[12682.63s -> 12684.63s]  You seem a bit slow.
[12684.63s -> 12686.63s]  I'm very fast. Let me show you. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,
[12686.63s -> 12688.63s]  toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat
[12688.63s -> 12690.63s]  That's impressive.
[12690.63s -> 12692.63s]  Admittedly, nothing to do with blue collar.
[12692.63s -> 12694.63s]  It'd be crazy. It'd be an ocean violation just to do that.
[12694.63s -> 12696.63s]  Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[12696.63s -> 12698.63s]  And I figured out that great white collar, so, you know, I gotta
[12698.63s -> 12700.63s]  I got a lawyer friend.
[12700.63s -> 12702.63s]  I just call them in. We just square it away.
[12702.63s -> 12704.63s]  I don't know why we need law in this.
[12704.63s -> 12707.59s]  I mean what do you want you want me to give you a hundred bucks and I'll give you a hundred bucks
[12707.59s -> 12713.51s]  How much is your fee? Zero change. You got a fee? My fee? Yeah, it's not a flat. It's percentage-based
[12713.51s -> 12717.11s]  And then there's a finder there's a finder's fee. There's a finder's fee. A finder's fee because I found it.
[12717.11s -> 12724.99s]  Let me just call him up. Let me just call him up. Oh finder's fee. My giant dollars of bills. Call your lawyer.
[12724.99s -> 12729.71s]  Sure. Get a lawyer in here. You realize you never would have found the money if it ain't were for us.
[12729.71s -> 12731.91s]  Is this Stevenson Stevenson Stevenson and Randy?
[12732.91s -> 12734.91s]  You should a lawyer down here
[12735.63s -> 12741.19s]  Weirdo at nine eight five nine eight. Yeah, why don't we just take this and put it like yeah, there's beer here
[12741.19s -> 12745.31s]  That ain't your money. That ain't your money. You might want to put it down there. But yeah, if you could just come down
[12745.87s -> 12747.87s]  We just got a dispute really
[12748.79s -> 12753.67s]  You mind if I have some of this bread? Go ahead have a piece of bread. He's being kind of a dick. Yeah
[12754.71s -> 12758.11s]  So, I don't know if we can just figure that out. That'd be great. I'll see you in a bit
[12758.83s -> 12762.11s]  Is that all you got in this house and bread this bread this mac and cheese up there
[12762.11s -> 12765.79s]  But it takes a while to make just forget it. Good to go for a homemade cookie. Yeah
[12769.64s -> 12776.80s]  So, you know a guy he knows about finders fees, you know is about your percentage. Oh, I'm so tired
[12778.96s -> 12780.96s]  We're doing everything for
[12788.66s -> 12793.02s]  Come on in wow, this is quite the establishment
[12808.46s -> 12814.78s]  Mentally fit enough to be able to situation. Well, nice to meet you. But hey, it's Bob Doug Stevenson

[12829.78s -> 12833.30s]  You got here just want to let you know a couple of things zoning rights that we have
[12836.26s -> 12841.02s]  Okay, all right now listen, what's what's the pickle we got I got $50,000 and I was in my
[12842.02s -> 12848.54s]  They want money okay, so here let me get you let me get it. Okay, you're stealing my electricity for a significant amount of time
[12848.54s -> 12849.58s]  I'll make that very clear
[12849.58s -> 12854.18s]  The only reason I was in this establishment is because he stole my electricity back in my day. We called that thievery
[12854.18s -> 12859.62s]  Oh thievery a hundred percent. Okay, that's a sin. That's in the Bible. Then I called my guy here
[12859.62s -> 12864.50s]  I called my guy. So it was a finders fee for me. I think that's legal. I think that's legal ease for I get money
[12864.50s -> 12868.82s]  That's right. I call my guy. Oh, he takes care of a thing. I mean look at it
[12868.82s -> 12870.82s]  Take anything
[12875.78s -> 12877.78s]  My wife was saying the same thing

[12913.82s -> 12915.82s]  Why is he literally sleeping right now?
[12916.26s -> 12920.90s]  Is that does that mean he doesn't want the money you think is that legal for it?

[16873.82s -> 16875.82s]  It came down
[16876.88s -> 16878.88s]  Hey
[16883.28s -> 16890.27s]  Yes, it was take a look I got it down look see we were trying to do it for less than four hours

[16905.94s -> 16911.70s]  Yes, uh, that's great they've been here for a few times downstairs if you could that'd be great
[16915.71s -> 16921.07s]  Yeah down here is good
[16921.07s -> 16923.07s]  Down here is good. Just make your way over here
[16925.31s -> 16928.59s]  I got this beers in the fridge. There's uh, I might need that
[16928.75s -> 16932.21s]  Hey
[16932.59s -> 16934.03s]  Hey, hey guys
[16934.03s -> 16936.59s]  Um, nothing. I was just talking to my lawyer friend
[16937.31s -> 16939.31s]  And he had some interesting information. Uh
[16940.11s -> 16942.75s]  If you wouldn't mind this is the lawyer about what?
[16944.11s -> 16948.91s]  Just just some interesting things about this house of yours. What's what's wrong with it?
[16951.07s -> 16954.59s]  I don't feel comfortable. I'm not a lawyer. What's the party? We're having a good time
[16954.99s -> 16959.07s]  Yeah, looking at the county records and looking at the property maps and things
[16959.15s -> 16961.31s]  Apparently this house was built on
[16962.27s -> 16964.03s]  Somebody else's property
[16964.03s -> 16969.87s]  Maybe somebody built on somebody else's property somebody else owns this property that this house has been built on
[16970.19s -> 16972.67s]  Somebody owns this. Okay. Yeah, so technically
[16974.11s -> 16976.11s]  It's probably
[16976.27s -> 16978.27s]  Their house their property
[16978.75s -> 16983.15s]  How is that even humanly possible? I've built that this was a house that was built
[16984.03s -> 16987.39s]  These are the county records that i've obtained. Well, how long have you lived here?
[16988.03s -> 16993.87s]  A two three weeks not very long. Not very long. You're nine eight five. Yeah, because I heard someone lived at nine eight three
[16996.27s -> 16997.95s]  Okay
[16997.95s -> 16999.95s]  Germo, what do you mean? Nine eight three
[17000.67s -> 17002.35s]  Oh, what?
[17002.35s -> 17004.03s]  I'm ludwig
[17004.03s -> 17005.39s]  What the fuck?
[17005.39s -> 17008.51s]  Yes, no, you're not this entire time. Well
[17009.55s -> 17014.35s]  You've been no no no no no, we're talking the land you built on is nine eight five
[17014.35s -> 17017.73s]  And maybe I passed an eye this whole time to your discrepancies
[17018.35s -> 17021.39s]  What are you talking about? No, but after I walked in on
[17022.27s -> 17023.87s]  Oh gosh
[17023.87s -> 17025.95s]  After I walked in on you and that cretin
[17027.15s -> 17029.15s]  He's gonna be okay
[17029.47s -> 17034.51s]  Well, I think he'll be fine. It's not like he could kill himself. I don't wait. Wait, wait, come over here. I need to talk to you
[17035.39s -> 17037.39s]  Show him the deed show me the deed. What are you talking about?
[17037.47s -> 17042.75s]  I this house has been built. I didn't whose name does it say there whose house doesn't say it says nine eight three
[17042.83s -> 17046.43s]  I've been building i'm in i'm in ludwig's back yard
[17047.15s -> 17050.67s]  Of nine eight three. This is nine eight five does not exist. This is an official document
[17051.23s -> 17052.51s]  It's accurate
[17052.51s -> 17057.95s]  Well, how does it make any sense? You've been emilia you built on my land without asking and I passed a blind eye
[17058.03s -> 17060.43s]  Because I liked you and I thought we'd get along great
[17060.83s -> 17063.87s]  What are you talking about? I was supposed to I was supposed to deal with this. What are you talking about?
[17064.51s -> 17067.87s]  Can deal with it pretty simply deal with it pretty simply. It's called you get out get out of the house
[17067.95s -> 17071.47s]  It's how about you get out of my house. No, you get out of my house. How's your house?
[17071.47s -> 17074.59s]  Look at this paper. That's really nothing. That's not actually
[17075.31s -> 17081.07s]  That is a legal document and ludwig owns the property and what the fuck are you talking about?
[17081.63s -> 17086.67s]  So you just got invited over as a party. You're my friend. The law is the law and the law is the law
[17086.75s -> 17089.79s]  No, it's not this doesn't make any sense. How about you get the fuck out of my house?
[17090.67s -> 17093.71s]  You don't own this house. I own this land
[17094.11s -> 17100.83s]  985 dollhouse way I was having a party and I invited everybody actually invited two people
[17100.83s -> 17103.95s]  But you all showed up because everybody this day. Well, I thought you wanted to hang out with me
[17103.95s -> 17107.95s]  Maybe apologize everybody this day. We're just cracked apparently and everyone's on drugs
[17108.03s -> 17110.51s]  First thing you said to me when I walked in is you didn't clean the house enough
[17111.07s -> 17114.19s]  I didn't even know you were ludwig and then you took the mask off. Does that matter?
[17114.59s -> 17119.71s]  Does that mean you need to treat me with respect if i'm ludwig? Okay. Uh, it's great sounds great
[17119.87s -> 17125.71s]  I I can represent impossible for me to that makes no sense. Don't log into my account. Don't stream on that account either
[17126.91s -> 17128.75s]  Come on, let's go discuss this
[17128.75s -> 17134.51s]  No, I'm ready to evict me. I'm kicking them out of this. No one's evicting me. This is my property. I live here
[17135.23s -> 17137.23s]  Is the sheriff evicting me?
[17137.31s -> 17138.59s]  Hey
[17138.59s -> 17141.47s]  I need your help. Ludwig. Don't let him stream on my account, please
[17142.11s -> 17144.43s]  I'm not worried about him streaming on your account. Follow me
[17145.15s -> 17148.67s]  I got the info. Hey, can you help me? I need some muscle. Where's the sheriff? Can you represent?
[17148.67s -> 17154.03s]  Yes, I can represent stevenson stevenson stevenson and randy. I got banned from twitch last weekend. I'm gonna need you to help me
[17154.11s -> 17157.39s]  I can I can could you follow me? Yeah, I could follow you. This is my
[17157.95s -> 17159.95s]  Yeah kitchen. Yeah your kitchen
[17163.50s -> 17165.50s]  Oh now you feel bad
[17165.74s -> 17169.34s]  It's my house. It's not even your house. It's my house. You built on my property
[17169.42s -> 17171.42s]  Maybe if you treated me nicer this wouldn't happen this way
[17173.02s -> 17178.06s]  I don't even know your name. Oh, there's the sheriff. What do you mean the sheriff? Get off me. Where's my bear friend?
[17178.06s -> 17180.06s]  He's the only person I like here. Well, he's
[17180.78s -> 17184.94s]  Hopefully not here. Oh, that should be officer right now. Thank you. It's my door. I'll take it. Yeah
[17186.06s -> 17190.06s]  Oh sheriff, what are you doing? I'm trying to help. I'm hey, but we gotta follow
[17190.62s -> 17196.14s]  You gotta follow the world. Okay, you got like he's trespassing. What's going on here? He's trespassing and I want him out of my house
[17196.86s -> 17198.86s]  This guy right here
[17202.78s -> 17207.50s]  That is a legal document I obtained from for well, what do you think it says? Okay. I mean it says you
[17207.74s -> 17213.18s]  I well, okay, because it's my property property my property. Listen, i'm sorry, man. You gotta come with me
[17213.90s -> 17215.90s]  It's all legal. Listen, it's
[17223.74s -> 17225.74s]  That's right bear book him too
[17232.38s -> 17234.38s]  Fine i'll go fine
[17237.50s -> 17239.50s]  Can you can you rep for me and just say
[17251.58s -> 17254.86s]  That's a great part it's a good time. Hey, welcome to ludwig's dollhouse
[17257.54s -> 17259.54s]  Sorry if that hurt
[17260.18s -> 17262.72s]  Are you spiking the punch?
[17262.72s -> 17263.76s]  All right
[17263.76s -> 17269.25s]  You're just gonna leave after spike
[17269.25s -> 17273.41s]  Thank god. I'm a maid
[17273.41s -> 17291.81s]  All right my house now, what does it smell like cigar smoke what the zuck happened here
[17294.85s -> 17307.31s]  Oh, it's terrible
[17307.31s -> 17309.79s]  Should I call my own maid or am I my own maid?
[17310.59s -> 17312.27s]  Why is there?
[17312.27s -> 17317.97s]  Okay, I imagine that doesn't belong there
[17320.10s -> 17323.30s]  All right. I'll ignore that
[17323.30s -> 17325.30s]  Still smells like cigar smoke
[17340.98s -> 17344.88s]  God, I can't clean this
[17345.60s -> 17347.60s]  How do you even begin to clean this?
[17348.72s -> 17353.44s]  There's no trash can for giant drywall
[17361.79s -> 17363.79s]  That was covering the paint, okay
[17365.41s -> 17366.69s]  right
[17366.69s -> 17369.18s]  Clean that back up
[17369.18s -> 17372.94s]  I think the posters are sold out, but we could maybe sell that one and i'll take that cut
[17373.82s -> 17382.27s]  Oh fresh baked cookies
[17386.30s -> 17387.92s]  Well, that's ugly
[17387.92s -> 17394.26s]  Ooh
[17394.26s -> 17396.26s]  This is a fashionable robe
[17402.58s -> 17416.53s]  Okay, it's really wet
[17419.14s -> 17424.19s]  Okay, that's kind of gross
[17427.17s -> 17429.17s]  Well, that's kind of gross
[17429.49s -> 17431.98s]  I'll just take the cookies and be gone
[17437.18s -> 17443.09s]  Having less autonomy is just a living hell. Oh now I get to make the bed. Okay, that makes a lot of sense
[17444.21s -> 17446.21s]  Clean and make bed should be symbiotic
[17447.49s -> 17453.17s]  Do I have to make the piss bed or can I sleep on the children's bed?
[17453.81s -> 17461.14s]  You know what the worst kind of people are the people who buy sequin pillows
[17461.78s -> 17463.14s]  And do this
[17463.14s -> 17466.26s]  Like what do you think you are houdini? It's just a pillow relax
[17469.60s -> 17470.56s]  Oh
[17470.56s -> 17491.01s]  What does he even do all day? I'm not gonna bother with this room
[17494.66s -> 17497.14s]  Germa must still be home. I should kick him out
[17510.30s -> 17514.19s]  Oh god
[17514.19s -> 17517.97s]  Smells like shit in here
[17518.05s -> 17521.31s]  Right. That's
[17521.31s -> 17523.31s]  That was the laugh track moment
[17524.67s -> 17526.43s]  Maybe he had some
[17526.43s -> 17528.40s]  It's a little late
[17528.40s -> 17530.40s]  Shower time. Okay
[17531.47s -> 17533.47s]  Uh, how would I do this? Let's just
[17542.86s -> 17544.86s]  You know, this is not my first time doing this live
[17545.34s -> 17550.85s]  Okay, no peeping toms
[17550.85s -> 17557.76s]  You know what the worst thing you can do in a shower is?
[17559.36s -> 17560.96s]  Piss or shit in it
[17560.96s -> 17563.14s]  It's like other people might use it
[17564.70s -> 17566.70s]  You know, i'll do it sometimes but
[17567.18s -> 17569.18s]  It's still pretty deplorable of me
[17570.24s -> 17572.32s]  You know nothing wrong with pissing as long as you don't shit
[17574.08s -> 17577.84s]  All right, that's that's enough shower. That should be I feel clean enough
[17577.84s -> 17579.84s]  Yes
[17582.74s -> 17589.79s]  There it is
[17589.79s -> 17592.43s]  Is there another maid service in this town or am I the only maid?
[17593.58s -> 17595.58s]  Why are there so many stools?
[17603.47s -> 17606.03s]  Okay, uh
[17617.50s -> 17620.22s]  What was the point of kicking out germa? I have two houses now
[17621.44s -> 17624.32s]  I could have just charged him rent
[17624.32s -> 17626.72s]  I mean at the end of the day all he asked me to do was just
[17630.14s -> 17631.58s]  Go on one date
[17631.58s -> 17633.58s]  Sounded like we were dating
[17637.47s -> 17643.66s]  And he deserved it
[17644.90s -> 17646.66s]  It's gonna be tiring
[17646.66s -> 17648.54s]  You know if someone
[17648.54s -> 17650.14s]  Really wanted to
[17650.14s -> 17653.34s]  They could have me take a nice bed
[17654.80s -> 17659.44s]  I've seen how you make germa act. You don't have to act the same with me. We can have a good relationship, you know
[17660.32s -> 17664.08s]  Actually follow through with love stories and not just burn them to the ground by having sex with death
[17667.90s -> 17669.90s]  Just an option, I guess
[17678.61s -> 17688.46s]  What's the point of parties it's too many people to even have a conversation with every conversation's dull shit
[17689.42s -> 17691.90s]  Seven people told me they're gonna go to japan but covet hit
[17693.15s -> 17700.08s]  I don't give a shit
[17700.08s -> 17709.46s]  Oh, maybe I should call him back sometime. I'm tired go jogging
[17710.46s -> 17713.07s]  Go jog
[17713.07s -> 17715.07s]  So it doesn't matter who's in the titular role
[17715.65s -> 17718.77s]  People said oh no, it's just because it's germa that we treat him poorly
[17720.26s -> 17723.94s]  But perhaps really you just treat everyone poorly who comes into this room
[17726.50s -> 17729.78s]  Even given the pope you'd probably still make him go jogging as he's fatigued
[17732.72s -> 17735.02s]  Who do you treat nicely?
[17735.50s -> 17737.71s]  Oh
[17737.71s -> 17739.15s]  Jogging
[17739.15s -> 17744.29s]  Oh, hello. Are you doing jumping jackson cigar smoke? Is someone ready to get fit?

[18183.90s -> 18185.98s]  hasn't even been much colder, but
[18187.12s -> 18190.88s]  This is great
[18190.88s -> 18201.20s]  Wow, that doesn't seem festive, but maybe for birthdays
[18202.29s -> 18204.29s]  Why are there so many cigars?
[18211.07s -> 18224.34s]  Now wait a second it feels as though it's a bit short maybe for the previous tenant make sense
[18227.20s -> 18231.74s]  Go back outside. Go back outside. Okay. Good garden the flowers

[18241.09s -> 18243.10s]  garden, okay

[18281.38s -> 18283.38s]  Thank you you picked that yourself
[18283.78s -> 18287.14s]  Yeah, I would have gone taller, but you know, how about you come in? Okay, how about you come in?

[18305.62s -> 18307.14s]  camo
[18307.14s -> 18310.34s]  It doesn't really work on you because you stick out like a sore thumb with that
[18310.98s -> 18316.82s]  Okay, beautiful body of yours. I really appreciate other clothing. I am married. Okay married to the game
[18316.98s -> 18320.82s]  I am married. So i'm physically married. I'm just going to i'm gonna give that to you
[18321.70s -> 18326.34s]  All right, i'll give that to you. Well, hey, if you ever don't tell nobody i said that, you know
[18327.38s -> 18329.38s]  Yeah, if you're ever interested
[18330.18s -> 18331.46s]  985
[18331.46s -> 18337.86s]  985 and 983. I actually own both. Okay. Yeah, I love what you did with the place. Thank you. You look great. Yeah
[18338.66s -> 18339.86s]  Legal dispute
[18339.86s -> 18345.86s]  Anytime you need electricity anytime you need electricity, there's an extension cord already and I can just use it. It's yours. Okay
[18346.42s -> 18347.86s]  That's convenient
[18347.86s -> 18349.86s]  I feel like it'd be a huge headache
[18352.26s -> 18356.35s]  Okay
[18356.35s -> 18358.83s]  Pee pee poo poo or eat eat we gotta pick one
[18359.63s -> 18362.99s]  Because right now it's uh, well, it's a little all over the wall
[18369.42s -> 18371.66s]  It seems gross, but they kind of look appealing
[18377.52s -> 18380.96s]  Oh, i'll clean yeah, i'll just this seems to be somewhat
[18381.74s -> 18385.68s]  Stereotypical feels like we could have respected maybe the job more and
[18386.64s -> 18388.64s]  and been like, oh maybe that's that's
[18388.96s -> 18390.96s]  That's what they do day to day. So perhaps
[18391.68s -> 18393.68s]  You know, they could take care of
[18393.68s -> 18395.68s]  The rest of what they got going on
[18396.00s -> 18398.80s]  But i'll clean i'll clean i've cleaned this place before
[18399.84s -> 18401.84s]  And do it again
[18402.56s -> 18403.84s]  Uh
[18403.84s -> 18408.16s]  Admittedly all the utensils were me so I can't be too upset
[18411.58s -> 18413.58s]  What is this small pinata?
[18414.38s -> 18417.71s]  Does this have actual pizza in it?
[18419.10s -> 18421.41s]  What?
[18421.41s -> 18423.89s]  Why is it so red?
[18423.89s -> 18427.25s]  How do you get pizza that red is it made with beets instead of tomatoes?
[18430.16s -> 18432.32s]  It's so it's a week old
[18433.20s -> 18435.12s]  Why would you put edip?
[18435.12s -> 18437.73s]  I would have eaten that
[18437.73s -> 18438.86s]  Okay
[18438.86s -> 18440.86s]  I get the white bread thing now
[18446.82s -> 18448.82s]  There's so much alcohol
[18449.70s -> 18451.62s]  Does he ever drink water?
[18451.62s -> 18454.18s]  Is there a way to drink water in this house or is it only?
[18455.86s -> 18457.86s]  Unmarked sodas and unmarked beers
[18461.60s -> 18463.60s]  Sorry, i'm not allowed to do that yet
[18464.16s -> 18467.20s]  But if anyone wanted to feed me that's what I would do
[18467.92s -> 18469.92s]  But for now i'm staying hungry
[18470.48s -> 18471.76s]  Had someone
[18471.76s -> 18475.36s]  Wanted that to happen. That's what could happen, but we'll never know
[18479.79s -> 18491.47s]  Well, this room's not bad then i'm anxious just being here
[18499.46s -> 18501.52s]  I have to work
[18501.52s -> 18503.52s]  Why am I being called by elvin men?
[18504.90s -> 18507.31s]  I'm a maid
[18507.31s -> 18510.54s]  Is this for the king?
[18510.54s -> 18514.06s]  You know, it's been a pretty long day. I had a few different things for everybody last week
[18514.14s -> 18518.62s]  I had a couple of payments that I was a little late on it's been kind of a difficult time and i'm wondering
[18518.62s -> 18522.70s]  I think looking for a rail. This is the only job I had this is cleaning this house. Whose house am I?
[18525.10s -> 18527.10s]  Oh gosh
[18527.18s -> 18529.57s]  Uh
[18529.57s -> 18531.57s]  Just on my way to work. How's it going?
[18532.37s -> 18533.89s]  well
[18533.89s -> 18535.89s]  Ludwig or Amelia works generally, but thank you
[18536.69s -> 18538.69s]  Good day to you, too
[18590.21s -> 18620.46s]  I own two houses. It doesn't make a lot of sense to go to work
[18621.34s -> 18623.58s]  I could just rent out a house
[18623.98s -> 18625.98s]  Doesn't add a lot of value to society, but
[18626.46s -> 18628.46s]  It's a good way to accumulate wealth
[18632.24s -> 18634.74s]  But nothing over 2.6 million
[18634.98s -> 18637.73s]  That'd be too much frankly
[18640.05s -> 18642.05s]  All right. Why?
[18643.26s -> 18646.02s]  Did I leave it open?
[18646.02s -> 18649.14s]  if you leave both open it kind of ruins the illusion then never mind but
[18649.86s -> 18655.94s]  Do people just come to my house? What?
[18656.10s -> 18662.80s]  Let me take off my work uniform
[18663.76s -> 18665.12s]  Okay, uh
[18665.12s -> 18667.12s]  Can we do one thing that's good for me?
[18667.92s -> 18668.96s]  All right
[18668.96s -> 18670.96s]  Shower piss eat
[18670.96s -> 18674.40s]  Sleep, I think all of them would be pretty pretty helpful right now
[18678.61s -> 18683.17s]  Play outside. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. No, I have to piss. Oh, yeah play outside
[18686.66s -> 18690.78s]  Hey
[18690.78s -> 18694.59s]  Whoa
[18694.59s -> 18696.96s]  Does this get us in trouble?
[18709.39s -> 18718.78s]  Oh, it's fun good performance
[18726.05s -> 18728.05s]  Can I can I do something good for me?
[18729.18s -> 18730.78s]  I don't want to be outside
[18730.78s -> 18740.48s]  I'll just i'll hover near things that I would like to do and maybe maybe
[18741.12s -> 18743.12s]  You know, it's like a hint
[18751.81s -> 18757.70s]  Didn't close the legs bed didn't mean to do that. It's more
[18759.17s -> 18762.74s]  looting
[18762.74s -> 18765.06s]  Okay, there's already a lot of piss in the bed
[18767.01s -> 18768.37s]  oh
[18768.37s -> 18778.37s]  I feel like having a bedroom through a room with a reciprocating saw and a sledge hammer
[18778.93s -> 18783.73s]  And a knife that is far too sharp and a bunch of broken drywall isn't the safest way to
[18784.85s -> 18790.03s]  live life
[18790.03s -> 18792.46s]  Wow, look at this
[18792.46s -> 18794.46s]  Maybe still available. I don't know
[18794.54s -> 18810.32s]  All right
[19263.71s -> 19265.71s]  What are you doing in my house
[19270.53s -> 19274.37s]  You're gifting me cookies
[19274.37s -> 19280.26s]  No, okay
[19280.26s -> 19281.78s]  Stop gifting me
[19281.78s -> 19293.98s]  Okay, you didn't trap us in here
[19300.32s -> 19301.76s]  You sit on the stool
[19301.76s -> 19311.15s]  What are you doing in my home?
[19312.32s -> 19314.32s]  Oh, yeah
[19315.36s -> 19320.35s]  Of course, it's you
[19321.95s -> 19323.95s]  You couldn't even be a proper man
[19324.51s -> 19326.51s]  a shadow boxer
[19326.90s -> 19329.54s]  You know how hard it was to get involved in that group
[19330.26s -> 19334.02s]  Was it like their auditions? What do you know? And just hold on a second delete the same
[19334.66s -> 19338.50s]  Delete this the same file. You need to delete it. We're gonna start over what's delete the save file

[19353.87s -> 19356.27s]  Not a chance at hell. Am I gonna let this happen?
[19356.91s -> 19360.03s]  You don't live here, but I I earned it. You can't just redo it
[19360.11s -> 19364.75s]  No, I can redo it because then i'm gonna redo the save and we're gonna start a new game
[19366.11s -> 19372.67s]  Starting right now. It's a lot of piss. Hello production production. I'd like to start a new save file, please
[19374.56s -> 19376.24s]  What? No

[19455.06s -> 19458.82s]  It's within one percent. It looks like 99 percent said no
[19459.78s -> 19461.78s]  I am literally deleting
[19466.74s -> 19471.46s]  You need to restart the game because like it's oh look I need control again
[19477.30s -> 19480.90s]  You think it's worth restarting you think you could change things I think so
[19481.78s -> 19488.74s]  Well, look at how you run things so far last two days. It's not easy. Is it? No, I couldn't pee or shower exactly
[19489.38s -> 19491.38s]  It sucks. I think they're trying to kill me
[19494.90s -> 19496.90s]  What's the issue? Why are you deleting the save file?
[19503.86s -> 19505.86s]  The issue is
