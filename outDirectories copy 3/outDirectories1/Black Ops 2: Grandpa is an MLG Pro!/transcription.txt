[0.31s -> 14.82s]  Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here, and welcome to Black Ops 2.
[14.82s -> 19.82s]  We've been waiting for this game for so long, and it's finally here. I can't wait to talk about it.
[19.82s -> 26.82s]  I could even sing a song about this game, but I'm not going to. We're going to talk about tips and tricks,
[26.82s -> 32.82s]  and what I've found in the game so far to be cool, and that sort of shit. So sit back and relax, and let's do it!
[32.82s -> 38.58s]  So the first tip I can give you is to go right to your menu the second you load the game up,
[38.58s -> 45.58s]  and get yourself pumped up for Black Ops 2. You want to crank the music as loud as it can possibly go.
[45.58s -> 50.58s]  And here we go, ladies and gentlemen, Black Ops 2 is in the house! Crank that volume! Let's go, baby!
[50.58s -> 59.20s]  cheX
[61.20s -> 65.20s]  Also, you've got to make sure you drink your favourite game fuel. Just like this!
[65.20s -> 72.42s]  You know I like getting this game. Come on, let me get my game fuel, you fucking piece of shit!
[76.93s -> 80.93s]  Okay, got him, got him!
[80.93s -> 85.30s]  This next one is not so big a tip, as it is an absolute necessity.
[85.30s -> 92.10s]  Necessity you want to get on your final fucking kill game after every single match and
[93.10s -> 99.65s]  That's it. That's all I got. I think I'm my hallucinating right now
[99.89s -> 104.77s]  Are you guys seeing bugs on the screen like a shitload of beetles like a thousand of them?
[105.29s -> 111.05s]  No, my I'm freaking out. I think I drank way too much of that shit man. I'm losing it
[111.31s -> 113.31s]  Now there's mice all over the floor
[114.09s -> 116.09s]  There's mice everywhere. Oh
[117.53s -> 122.63s]  The whole room is on fire right now. This entire room's on fire. There's bugs and beetles
[124.83s -> 130.39s]  Wait, what are you doing? Yeah, and I'll call a duty black ops 2 came out. You're real excited. Just calm down
[130.39s -> 132.71s]  You don't have to worry about it. I'm gonna kill you
[133.15s -> 136.91s]  Burn your body and then eat it every single bit of it. I'm gonna swallow
[138.39s -> 140.81s]  I'm gonna swallow you whole
[141.45s -> 145.96s]  Grandpa you all right grandpa. Hey, hey
[146.96s -> 153.20s]  Hey, what's what is it? You were just staring right through me. Are you all right? You're sweating right now. Oh, I need to get you
[153.20s -> 158.36s]  Like a cloth. All right. Well, don't get it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, what is that? What the hell is that?
[158.48s -> 162.12s]  That's just as a drink as my game if you know, it's not yes
[162.12s -> 168.64s]  It is I see vodka gin three empty energy drinks and two empty coffees. Are you mixing drinks down here?
[168.64s -> 173.92s]  What are you doing, man? Just put it down. It's not come on duty black ops 2 only comes out once a year
[173.92s -> 176.64s]  So come on, whatever. I'll see you later
[177.16s -> 182.72s]  Also watch you step on the way out because I may have peed. Yep. Oh, yep. Definitely
