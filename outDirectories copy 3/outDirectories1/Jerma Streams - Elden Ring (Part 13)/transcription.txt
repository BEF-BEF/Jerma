[5.18s -> 18.09s]  Okay, get Elden Ring opened. I'm very excited about this. I do have to change a few things.
[18.81s -> 29.32s]  The reason why I'm so excited about Elden Ring is we are, I believe, at one of the probably
[29.32s -> 40.25s]  final points in the game. I am halfway, I believe, down the Hallow Tree. It looks like there was a
[40.25s -> 48.12s]  lot more to go. I do have to change this title though because this doesn't work. Uh, how about...
[48.76s -> 54.74s]  What's a good... I've done Elden Ring so many times. I don't even know what a good Elden Ring
[54.74s -> 71.82s]  title is anymore. What do I title this? Elden Ring... Elden... All right, spoiler alert. End game
[71.82s -> 97.88s]  area. Spoiler alert. Alert. Nothing easy, whatever. Elden... Elden. Elden Time. Onion Ring. That's awful.
[101.46s -> 125.02s]  Elden Ring. Getting to the end? Question mark? We'll see. Stay tuned to find out. Is it a bad title?
[125.02s -> 133.96s]  Whatever, it doesn't matter. What is playing in my headphones? Oh, this music, right. I was like,
[133.96s -> 159.74s]  where's that coming from? Okay, very nice. Is the game gonna get seen here? That's a Tuber title,
[159.74s -> 169.34s]  if I've ever seen one. Yeah, it is. I agree. I'm not gonna disagree with you. Sometimes Tuber titles
[169.34s -> 185.22s]  work. The face... The face game is not going off. It's on. Face game, is it gonna go? Hey, loading it.
[185.78s -> 192.33s]  What was the last... Okay, the last thing that... Somebody gave me a list of things I could do.
[192.89s -> 197.37s]  By the way, this is very much spoiler territory. This is actually like the end of the game
[197.93s -> 212.07s]  or like the final arc. Just please be aware of that. Be aware. Looking for a game to capture.
[212.15s -> 226.36s]  Right here, dude. This needs to shrink. Okay, so we... Last thing that happened.
[229.83s -> 235.35s]  Let me take a look at the map. Yeah, so I... Spoilers for anybody that like seriously does it.
[235.35s -> 241.78s]  It's like, what's happening? This is a spoiler. This is an end game spoiler. Three, two, one.
[242.50s -> 247.32s]  I burnt the urn tree. The urn tree is burning. The round table hold is now burning.
[248.20s -> 258.44s]  The two fingers are still stuck with their game crashed. I don't know why they're not back.
[259.66s -> 271.86s]  You'd think that they'd be like... They'd come back. So there was the halog tree. It was up here.
[271.86s -> 276.90s]  Oh, that's right. I did that thing too. Okay, so there was the halog tree. I could keep going down
[278.34s -> 285.94s]  or I could do this crumbling thing. And I think that somebody said there was an actual,
[285.94s -> 290.26s]  probably a better way to do it. Should I start at the halog tree or should I start at the crumbling
[290.26s -> 300.65s]  place? Okay, so I'm trying to remember what the... Because I killed... There was a boss here. Let's go
[300.65s -> 309.37s]  find it. How did I miss this much? I've been streaming this a lot. This is like my favorite
[309.37s -> 315.35s]  game ever. Okay, so let's just get back into this here. I got my moon stuff. Very nice.
[316.31s -> 328.34s]  I think this is the wrong one. I think it's this one. It's this one, right? The last thing that I
[328.34s -> 341.10s]  did is I beat Loretta. Yes, right here. Okay, so then I could keep going that way. Now I have not
[341.10s -> 344.46s]  been spoiled on anything in the game. I've been trying to stay away from a lot of Elden Ring stuff,
[344.46s -> 357.35s]  but I know for a fact that the boss that everyone hates I think is down here. So I can't tell you
[357.51s -> 361.51s]  that I'm necessarily prepared. I'm going to turn around and go do something else if I can't do it.
[363.13s -> 372.39s]  I think I can level up. Maybe I can. So this stream is going to continue. It's still pretty
[372.39s -> 383.99s]  early. I imagine I'll be able to play... What time is it? Like three or four hours? See? I need some
[383.99s -> 394.39s]  souls. All right, well, let's just go. Whatever. Two headphones going in. It's just not going to do.
[395.67s -> 408.23s]  All right, halog tree time. Let's go. How's the volume? Is it good? It's going to play for six
[408.23s -> 419.26s]  hours. What's it going to go until I don't feel like it? Interesting. All right, so that's the
[419.26s -> 422.62s]  halog tree. So what the fuck is the halog tree? Is somebody going to tell me when I go down here?
[431.98s -> 437.26s]  I don't think I can jump to there. Jerma, are you EST or PST? I am PST.
[442.63s -> 455.66s]  I think we need a fucking style light. Yes, we do. G4! G4 RAID! G4 TV! What's going on?
[456.38s -> 464.92s]  So I probably scared the shit out of people. I'm sorry. I may have just scared the absolute shit
[464.92s -> 470.52s]  out of all of you and I'm really sorry. G4 just raided. G4 raided before too. Thanks, G4.
[472.41s -> 480.68s]  Thank you. That's cool. I'm sorry. I scared the shit out of you. I'm really sorry.
[481.48s -> 488.07s]  No, thanks for the raid. You just missed me. Excuse me. Round as the bro versus bro against
[488.07s -> 504.66s]  Ludwig Championship. I just won. Spoiler. Ooh, okay. Ancient Dragons. We're at the end of Elden Ring.
[504.66s -> 510.98s]  So those of you that came from G4, just be aware this is like the last, probably third of the game.
[510.98s -> 516.78s]  If you don't want to be spoiled or anything, just I would run away now, immediately. Because you're
[516.78s -> 519.74s]  going to see some shit that you might not want to see if you haven't gotten this far. And I know a
[519.74s -> 525.90s]  lot of people haven't gotten this far because the game is like 500 hours long. So I get it.
[526.62s -> 538.34s]  Should I go down? Yeah, and if those are the new viewers, we always have to have fucking
[538.34s -> 545.99s]  skylight on. Helps you see a lot. That's a good tip. Yeah, they had this misspelling here.
[547.43s -> 552.31s]  I don't know why it's spelled that way. It's S-T-A-H. I think that's somebody fucked up.
[553.50s -> 567.72s]  Elviel, Brace of the Hallow Tree. Both of my weapons are max level. So unless I change what
[567.72s -> 587.06s]  I'm doing here, I don't have any need to go back and upgrade because of those knights.
[587.62s -> 601.10s]  All right, Starlight's kind of getting in the way. Starlight actually is bad.
[602.71s -> 606.31s]  I gotta get back in the swing thing. I gotta get back in the swing. It's been a while. It's been
[606.31s -> 625.06s]  like four or five days. I gotta remember what the buttons do. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[625.06s -> 638.06s]  I got it. See? Oh shit. Please make your face cam bounce around with the window screen saver.
[638.06s -> 649.03s]  Why would I do that? I still don't have enough. Is there anything else out there?
[652.10s -> 657.62s]  Whoa! My god, you are alive again. Oh well. I need to do this so I don't get mad and lose my souls.
[658.58s -> 674.23s]  That was dumb. All right, I gotta get back in the swing thing. It's like warm up. You don't
[674.23s -> 679.03s]  just like go out and throw nine enemies. I gotta go to the bullpen and like warm up for like 10
[679.03s -> 686.15s]  minutes. You can't just go out and pitch nine enemies. You gotta warm up. You gotta go through
[686.15s -> 698.73s]  the fucking rotation. Why do we come in with a raid? A YouTube raid? What's up, guys? Bro versus
[698.73s -> 714.79s]  bro champion. Okay. Where are the souls? Okay. All right. Hey, I gotta pay attention. Don't get the
[714.79s -> 723.48s]  souls. Don't lose 100,000 souls like an idiot. All right. Warm up is happening. Walk onto them.
[723.48s -> 735.86s]  Do I have enough to level up so I can stop doing this? No. God damn it. Okay. Just kill
[735.86s -> 741.85s]  one thing out. It's got to be like a randomly person or something out here. There we go. Okay.
[741.85s -> 765.83s]  That's better. Level up. What should I put it into? Yeah. Welcome, guys. Thanks, Ludwig. Always a
[765.83s -> 782.20s]  pleasure and some time with Ludwig. Probably mine. I want my mana. All right. Let's go.
[783.37s -> 807.93s]  I think I exploded. Hey, blow up. This way. I gotta get my gaming juices. I feel like I
[807.93s -> 817.74s]  I feel like I used up a lot of my gaming like juices. Is that bird tree avatar here?
[824.98s -> 833.75s]  You're gonna need a lot of juice. That guy didn't even have an Estus. I don't even know why. He had
[833.75s -> 849.69s]  an empty flask. I think I'm just gonna go straight for now. I could drop down there, but I could do
[849.69s -> 862.86s]  that anyways. Let's see. Let's see what's going on here. Drink, bro. I'm all right. Let's go up.
[863.50s -> 871.14s]  You're an enemy? These guys drop a lot of souls. Holy shit.
[874.47s -> 885.18s]  By the way, if you don't know, I am a cold wizard. Utilize ice spells, cold spells.
[894.74s -> 914.04s]  Is it Flintstone Sorcerer? Well, not really. Wait, can I go up there? I can. I guess I could
[914.04s -> 917.88s]  have dropped anyways, though. Fuck it. Let's go. Let's do it.
[923.51s -> 936.58s]  Michelin knight sword? All right. What is that? Strength, dex, and faith. Sword forged by servants
[936.58s -> 941.86s]  of Mickela of the Hallow Tree. With a design modeled after those carried by carrion knights.
[941.86s -> 945.70s]  Instead of the glintstone, however, amber from the Hallow Tree is embedded in the blade.
[946.82s -> 952.42s]  A sumptuous piece, yet it has never been offered to any knight an ill-starred sword with no master.
[953.38s -> 962.31s]  Holy essence and fires off a golden blade projectile? That seems kind of cool.
[963.27s -> 977.10s]  Strength? Is it a great sword? Strength and dex. It's a cool faith sword. Do I want to go there yet?
[977.74s -> 983.37s]  Is the item down? All right. I'm gonna go to... Should I go down or keep going that way?
[983.93s -> 995.22s]  I could go down there or I could go over here. I want to see what that is. Is it gonna kill me?
[1002.84s -> 1010.74s]  Is a storm sword key thing over here? Is it not? No, that's where I came from.
[1010.74s -> 1022.58s]  I want... Oh no, I want to go down there, down there. All right. There is an avatar here though.
[1022.58s -> 1032.82s]  What have I done? Okay, I'm good. This is where the stone sword key is.
[1034.18s -> 1050.12s]  Watch out for the crazy enemies. I got a feeling these enemies are all gonna be crazy. What is this?
[1052.66s -> 1065.40s]  Triple rings of light? Fires three rings of light before the caster. This is int and faith.
[1065.96s -> 1073.85s]  Seen a lot of combo spells. Produces three rings of light and fires in four. The rings of light
[1073.85s -> 1078.57s]  return to a position close to the caster before disappearing. Gift from the young
[1078.57s -> 1097.50s]  Mickela to his father Radagon. Okay. Can't really use it, but yeah, I'm still using the baby rattle.
[1098.14s -> 1103.40s]  I like it. I don't know how much longer I'm gonna like it, but I know I like it right now
[1103.40s -> 1107.42s]  and that's all that matters. Good problem if that didn't find another fucking scream.
[1110.50s -> 1123.83s]  I really don't want to fight an avatar right now, but I guess I'm gonna have to.
[1130.63s -> 1152.60s]  He doesn't know. I actually don't, you're right. I would treat the reeds. What's in here? What do
[1152.60s -> 1166.15s]  I have in there? Is it the damage boost one? It is. Okay, I think I have enough flasks. Let's
[1166.15s -> 1176.62s]  top myself off. Let me try it. This is where I was before. Nice armor, dude. This is where I was
[1176.62s -> 1205.72s]  before, right? I don't need to climb up here. Let me just check. Let me make sure. Okay, we're good.
[1205.72s -> 1238.18s]  Go, go, go, go, go. So there's people shooting that stuff over there. I just stepped on his head.
[1239.30s -> 1244.94s]  Is there a faster way to get over there? Because this is kind of a terrible awful run.
[1245.74s -> 1255.29s]  I'm gonna assume no. So let's just. All right, so there's somebody doing that. Casting that spell
[1255.29s -> 1263.70s]  over right over there. Oh, is it just him? Is it just him doing it? It is just you doing it.
[1263.70s -> 1290.14s]  Why are you just spamming that? Come on, you don't have to. Oh, you do not like that cold shit.
[1290.94s -> 1324.06s]  Okay, do not get killed by this. We can grate some cheese here. We so desire. I almost died.
[1325.30s -> 1344.23s]  What's that? What do you got? Rotten staff. B and E causes scarlet rot buildup. Ceremonial staff
[1344.23s -> 1350.38s]  depicted the urd tree in its historic radiance. Festers with scarlet rot. Filled by the avatars
[1350.38s -> 1365.45s]  who protect the minor urd trees. It's rotten. Is there a race in here? No, there's a
[1365.45s -> 1388.42s]  room. But I should be fine because I have a flail. It's rotten. Newman's room. It's an item all the
[1388.42s -> 1415.06s]  way at the end. Sombra ancient dragon stone. Or. I have got a lot of those now. You guys weren't
[1415.06s -> 1428.63s]  kidding. Those pop up all the time. All right, what about even lower? I definitely can. Not yet.
[1429.27s -> 1442.95s]  Let me continue this way. I could jump off from here. That's really dangerous though.
[1443.75s -> 1461.78s]  All right, I need a shield. Parry shield please. I'm not putting up with this fucking asshole right
[1461.78s -> 1467.88s]  now. Parry, parry. I don't want heavy load but I just want a little buckler. There's a little
[1467.88s -> 1478.55s]  buckler. Don't I have one? Is this seriously going to put me over? Heavy load? It doesn't matter.
[1480.66s -> 1488.49s]  I'm going to parry it like twice. Is that a spear or is that the staff one? Oh, that's the staff one.
[1488.65s -> 1528.36s]  Never mind. Oh my god. I thought there was a railing. I thought there was like a waist high
[1528.36s -> 1545.30s]  railing or something. I did that. Don't, don't, don't, don't. No, I'm fine. Oh my god. I'm okay.
[1548.06s -> 1587.64s]  Oh, hold on here. You both suck. I don't want to drop down here again. It was terrible.
[1588.52s -> 1608.57s]  This way. Through there. Don't screw this up. You seem like the kind of guy that balls with
[1608.57s -> 1617.86s]  bumpers on. Yeah, I honestly think that the gutter in bowling, I don't know, it doesn't need to
[1617.86s -> 1642.22s]  exist. I don't understand why it exists. It's way more fun when it doesn't. You seem like you take
[1642.22s -> 1645.82s]  mini golf too seriously. Well, that's inaccurate because that means I would, you're assuming I
[1645.82s -> 1651.42s]  would play mini golf. I fucking hate that shit. I hate mini golf. Mini golf is the most infuriating,
[1652.38s -> 1664.34s]  unfun, terrible experience. It's never fun. Mini golf seems like a good idea for the first
[1664.34s -> 1667.30s]  20 minutes. Then you realize you have to sit there for three hours and do the whole thing.
[1668.02s -> 1682.38s]  Nothing here. Weird placement of that enemy. Once you get past the windmill, I'm done. I don't feel
[1682.38s -> 1701.61s]  like playing anymore. It should just stop at the windmill. There's two of them in here. All right.
[1701.61s -> 1728.52s]  I got to take this slow on this. Do it. Do it. Do it. You what? Oh, my heart hurts. Oh my god.
[1729.16s -> 1740.18s]  My body hurts. This is a fucking terrible place to fight you.
[1750.39s -> 1756.54s]  Get out here. We're both trying to do the same dumb shit to each other. Just get out here.
[1761.19s -> 1789.53s]  Good, good, good. Worst fight ever. Oh, a lot of smithing stones. Sevens. Sorry. Fight me.
[1789.53s -> 1805.00s]  This is back up, which I don't, there might be an item that I missed, but we'll see.
[1805.80s -> 1815.70s]  We'll continue this way. I'm going to say we're going to continue that way.
[1816.50s -> 1837.18s]  This way. He has such an ape face. An ape-like face. Do I? Kind of. I hear one of those cookie bugs.
[1839.18s -> 1866.62s]  Yeah, where's the cookie bug? Don't hit the guy in front of him. Nice. Don't waste man on this guy.
[1866.62s -> 1921.03s]  There's no reason to. Race. Oh, I can do that. Old Fang. Whoa. Looks like a building down there.
[1921.03s -> 1929.34s]  Have you even done the nebula move once? No, because the cold move,
[1930.14s -> 1935.00s]  there's not enough people to do it to. And the nebula is a great move and I use it.
[1935.00s -> 1941.05s]  Trust me, I do. Did I miss anything down here though? Let me just check.
[1941.69s -> 1945.83s]  I feel like there's like a grace or something here. What are you doing?
[1946.71s -> 1975.61s]  That guy aggro'd to me from downstairs. Really? I think it's safe to drop down there, but not
[1975.61s -> 1996.81s]  going to. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Hey. Well, I don't think we're going that way. Okay. Seriously,
[1996.81s -> 2008.33s]  what's the range on this? I have to go from above. What's that? You missed the grace.
[2009.77s -> 2021.24s]  Did I vote over here? I'll do the nebula in here. It seems like there's like five feet.
[2027.21s -> 2030.25s]  This is why you don't use the nebula. This is why I didn't want to do it
[2030.25s -> 2035.93s]  because you're on a goddamn. Oh no. It's one of those guys. Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[2035.93s -> 2054.87s]  go, go, go, go. Oh my God. Who's behind me? Oh, ladder. Quick. Oh please. I don't care if
[2054.87s -> 2060.39s]  I get poisoned. Just go, just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. No poison. Drink, drink on the ladder.
[2061.99s -> 2071.13s]  These guys are the worst enemy in the game. Those things are so, I freaked out.
[2078.36s -> 2086.55s]  I actually think that's probably where, that's the way to go. Did I get there before?
[2086.55s -> 2103.69s]  I actually kind of don't remember. And then down here and then I don't know. I don't remember.
[2103.69s -> 2112.54s]  Down all the way. Can I make it from here? I think so. All right. What about this? What's this?
[2123.21s -> 2145.10s]  Christ. Seed. Ooh. Does that guy have a spear? No, it's a staff. No, it's not. Is that a spear?
[2146.06s -> 2174.54s]  Okay. It's a spear. I need a, I need a shield. Oh, good. Holy shit. I'm gonna fucking help you.
[2175.82s -> 2196.92s]  Oh my God. I lost my subway order. Meatball. Just Meatball Marinara every time. The only thing
[2196.92s -> 2201.64s]  that I ever get there. Everything else is fucking dog shit at that, at that place. Meatball Marinara
[2201.64s -> 2206.04s]  is the only good thing there. It's super basic. It's super simple. It's not like crazy. Nothing,
[2206.04s -> 2220.07s]  nothing weird. Now that I lost my souls, who cares, right? I can go wherever I want.
[2220.87s -> 2254.38s]  Staff though. Why is somebody, I hear somebody walking behind me. Where is this person? This is
[2254.38s -> 2291.58s]  freaking me out. The two moons. Get over here. There above. All right. Chest. Legendary. Clean
[2291.58s -> 2308.50s]  Rot Knight Finley. Clean Rot Knight? Legendary Ashen remains used to summon the spirit of Clean
[2308.50s -> 2313.14s]  Rot Knight Finley. Finley was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia.
[2313.86s -> 2317.78s]  When an unimaginable act of heroism carried the slumbering demigod,
[2319.18s -> 2324.46s]  Millenia, all the way back to the Hallow Tree. He managed the feat alone,
[2324.46s -> 2338.52s]  fending off all manner of foes along the way. It's not going to replace Mambo. That's for sure.
[2339.56s -> 2344.26s]  Really cool though. Sounds really powerful. Sorry, we already have a best friend.
[2346.82s -> 2359.27s]  I need to get Mambo to plus 10. I don't know what to get a great grave glove ward. Should I go?
[2359.27s -> 2374.34s]  I don't think the play is down there. It's over here. Yeah, Mambo. I already did that.
[2377.03s -> 2380.41s]  This is the, okay, this part here. So you drop down. I'm just going to run to the
[2380.41s -> 2385.51s]  fucking bonfire or whatever it is. Right, right, right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[2387.06s -> 2390.02s]  All right. Right there. Right there. Right there. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[2391.67s -> 2407.83s]  Before he spawns, he's going to spawn. Go. Arrows? I think I'm safe. This should take me behind the,
[2410.01s -> 2423.83s]  yep, fucking avatar here. Oh, I'm running in the door. There's nothing here.
[2425.29s -> 2431.64s]  Oh, this is very bad. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad. Why have that there?
[2432.84s -> 2444.38s]  What's the point of this? It's just a thing. Why have that there?
[2446.54s -> 2449.98s]  Pulled for that reason. For that exact reason. For that, no, you fell for it. Yeah.
[2450.78s -> 2477.94s]  I'm right. Okay. That's the strategy. I know there's a grave somewhere. There has to be
[2478.02s -> 2488.09s]  somewhere right here. Right? All right. Same deal. Except I'm running right behind that avatar.
[2494.09s -> 2499.72s]  I'll come back out here and deal with this. Right there. Right past the avatar. Fucking,
[2499.72s -> 2504.52s]  why am I looking at you? Why am I looking over here? I know. I know. Stop looking over there.
[2504.52s -> 2508.44s]  Why am I looking? I know where it is. Just jump off. It's going to kill me. Three, two, one.
[2508.44s -> 2526.04s]  Fuck this game. Mad. Omega low. Oh, why did you jump? I, because I didn't mean to. My, it was a
[2526.60s -> 2538.58s]  reaction. I got to get there and then I'm going to go behind the urdry and attack from,
[2538.58s -> 2559.83s]  I'm going to go and backstab. Don't be stupid. Right here. Up down here. Don't stop moving.
[2559.83s -> 2576.14s]  There it is. Beautiful. Here. Excellent ball. That's fine. Go. Brink on the ladder. Don't stop.
[2576.94s -> 2594.54s]  Thank you. That went right between my legs. All right. Right there. Here we go. One, two, three.
[2595.26s -> 2636.42s]  Fuck just happened. You shoot. I touched it. I win. I touched it. I win. Ladder goes up, but
[2637.06s -> 2655.29s]  let's go. Let's do it. Check this out. Tree cannot come in here. Tree is in the building. Tree
[2655.29s -> 2673.40s]  can come in here. That's good to know. I thought you were going to get stuck. All right. You can't
[2673.40s -> 2689.90s]  come through here. No, I don't want to drink that potion. Where'd he go? What just happened?
[2689.90s -> 2726.42s]  Where'd he go? What do you got? Lord's Ruin and another rotten staff. Cross build is OP. Cross
[2726.42s -> 2732.34s]  build is very powered. I'm not just going to run through this thing because I want to see what
[2732.34s -> 2750.41s]  happens. There was an item or two that was over here. Works until it doesn't. I win. 11,000 souls.
[2750.57s -> 2762.78s]  Holy shit. Bud. Put your waste man on these chumps.
[2765.99s -> 2780.22s]  There's another one that's... Yeah, you. Does this reach? Really? Okay. Well, I think I can get these.
[2790.46s -> 2805.67s]  Let's see what's down here first. Can we get a birdwatch in the corner? Nah.
[2806.79s -> 2817.99s]  You can get like a sweaty guy corner. You can get a sweaty guy in a dark room. That's all I got for
[2817.99s -> 2842.20s]  you. Let's use the sowlord's room. 12,000 is what we need. 11,8. What about frogwatch?
[2843.16s -> 2864.14s]  Frogs are cool. Can we watch Jimmy Neutron? No, you cannot watch Jimmy Neutron. No frog stream. No,
[2864.14s -> 2870.68s]  stop. No frog. Stop it. That changed. Maybe I should turn the exposure up. What do you like
[2870.68s -> 2889.99s]  that I'm sitting in kind of a dark, sweaty room? It's reminding myself. That is... Am I urinal on?
[2889.99s -> 2896.74s]  No frog stream. No. Can we do an armpit check? No, no, you're like...
[2902.26s -> 2915.85s]  Hallow Tree Knight Helm. Elm worn by knights sworn to the Hallow Tree,
[2915.85s -> 2925.35s]  graced by a crown of unalloyed gold, increases faith by two. I think I look good.
[2926.23s -> 2931.22s]  This is pretty much what I'm going to be wearing. All right, so what's out here?
[2934.18s -> 2959.16s]  Elusiary wall? Elusiary wall this way? I mean, I could drop. No, that's where it just was. Nah,
[2959.16s -> 2982.20s]  okay. Good. Jerry wall? Elusiary. Elusory. How do you say it? Elus... Elusory? Here. Elusory?
[2983.74s -> 2994.15s]  What the fuck? Let's kill him. Right now. Watch this. I gotta kill that one first because that's
[2994.15s -> 3032.28s]  the one that casts spells. So we're going to go Dark Moon. I got it. Whatever. I got it. There's
[3032.28s -> 3036.52s]  nothing else over here that I need to do. What was that? A crystal, a rotten crystal sword? What
[3036.52s -> 3062.73s]  was it? You fucking suck balls. Thanks, man. I appreciate it. Okay, where is it? Rotten crystal.
[3062.73s -> 3069.29s]  This is int. Oh, it's strength. Scarlet Rot. Sword fashion from pure crystal,
[3069.29s -> 3075.10s]  a deed impossible for a human, and wreath with powerful magic, its attack scales with intelligence.
[3077.40s -> 3088.38s]  You can two-hand that? Yeah, but do I want to? I have no strength, though. I would have to respect
[3088.38s -> 3093.40s]  the character. We don't need to talk about respects until I really cannot beat certain things.
[3094.68s -> 3106.28s]  What does it look like? I mean, that's really cool. It's really cool, but it is kind of just
[3106.28s -> 3117.78s]  a weapon. It doesn't have anything like really fancy. Maybe rattle is slower,
[3119.06s -> 3129.16s]  but whatever. That's cool. Keep the rattle. Oh, Scarlet Rot. That's right. Huh. Let's look into
[3129.16s -> 3162.28s]  that in a minute. Not going over there yet. Hero's rune. What about the moon veil? I have a ton of
[3162.28s -> 3179.54s]  stones that I have not used in like 40 game hours. I can... goodness. Damn, that goes pretty
[3179.54s -> 3188.26s]  deep. If I want to upgrade another weapon, I can. So I'm very, very, very capable of just going and
[3188.26s -> 3201.83s]  just maxing out three other weapons if I really want to. What the fuck is that? It's one of those
[3201.83s -> 3209.83s]  things. What are you doing? That was... I didn't like that. That was unsettling. I didn't like it.
[3210.63s -> 3239.75s]  Is that rot? Of course it is. Holy fucking god, he came around. Holy shit, don't die, please.
[3240.87s -> 3257.82s]  Just gotta go in. Pest's glaive. Did I get one of these already? I feel like I've seen that.
[3258.38s -> 3282.23s]  Have I? No, where is it? Yeah, okay. I've seen it. Didn't impress me. Is there... Can I get... I
[3282.23s -> 3293.62s]  can't get on the horse either. This sucks. This really sucks. Oh my god, I cannot... All right,
[3293.62s -> 3310.50s]  that's bad. You gotta be shitting me. Okay, I need something. Please put a dagger on. A quick
[3310.50s -> 3322.70s]  step, right? Do not roll. Oh, that's right. Okay, I just need to dash. Did I roll to get it off me?
[3328.39s -> 3340.71s]  All right, I need some points of interest. I'm gonna get to that. Something's alive down there.
[3342.98s -> 3370.10s]  Soap time. Wow, it worked. All right, here we go. Oh my god, please. Please get the fuck away from
[3370.10s -> 3380.20s]  me. Please. Just keep going. Keep going. Keep going. I can get rid of it. What are these little
[3380.20s -> 3394.20s]  fucking weirdos? Don't use the fucking knife. Oh, bad. Put the fucking sword on. Put on a weapon.
[3395.16s -> 3405.42s]  You annoying little shits. I swear. I'm just leaving. Get me the fuck out of the way from this.
[3405.42s -> 3438.17s]  Go. Let's go. I don't care. Let's fuck these things. Oh, whoa. Am I safe? That sucked. What
[3438.17s -> 3461.53s]  the fuck is that? I thought I just went the wrong way. Please tell me there's a grace in here and
[3461.53s -> 3501.13s]  it's not like somebody's sitting behind the corner. Stoop his ladder. Yes. Thank god. All
[3501.13s -> 3514.49s]  right, now what? I might go back up. I'm out here. I don't want to go out here yet.
[3524.30s -> 3551.29s]  It looks like I could have kept going down. I'm here. I keep going. If you live in there,
[3551.29s -> 3599.35s]  you're fine. What about over here? Excuse me. Go that way. More rot. That's a legendary.
[3599.35s -> 3610.97s]  Ah, fuck you. Don't. What did you do? What did you just do? Oh my god. How did you miss that?
[3616.54s -> 3635.98s]  I fought a hundred of you. I'll fight you again. Holy shit. His health. Let's try it again.
[3635.98s -> 3650.54s]  I want to at least get the item. At the very least, I want the item. Those things are
[3650.54s -> 3661.30s]  everywhere. We get a post-death interview. Um, I don't, I don't, I don't give interviews.
[3663.93s -> 3666.57s]  You have to book me like at least three or four weeks in advance.
[3667.37s -> 3690.94s]  Sorry. I'm just gonna get the item and then run. Whoa. What the fuck? Why? That's so scary.
[3692.63s -> 3697.75s]  I thought he came from the other side. All right. Oh, great. Grave. Glob wards. That's what I want.
[3697.75s -> 3709.22s]  That's exactly what I was looking for. Holy shit. I can get a plus 10 mambo. I got this.
[3709.86s -> 3751.98s]  Fuck. He's gonna knock me off with a blast. I can kill him. I can kill this guy. Just burn.
[3751.98s -> 3759.82s]  It's a burn fight. You do dark moon. And then after dark moon, you sit up in your chair and
[3759.82s -> 3766.22s]  you just hope that your ass is not connected to your underwear. And that is now connected as well
[3766.22s -> 3783.18s]  to your pants because of just sitting here sweating. Okay. Same deal. We're going to go
[3783.18s -> 3787.10s]  up here. I'm going to the moon and then we're switching to the blade and I'm going to be
[3787.10s -> 3792.06s]  prepared. We're going to wait. Here we go. YouTuber voice, YouTuber gameplay commentary. Here we go.
[3792.70s -> 3795.74s]  Okay. So we're heading this way. Okay, guys. All right, fellas.
[3796.46s -> 3844.54s]  Hey, boys and girls. All right. Cool. Okay. Here we go. What was that? Too far away. Fuck you.
[3845.50s -> 3862.22s]  What?
[3871.38s -> 3910.71s]  It's going to explode. No. Blast you. Blast. It's not funny anymore. It's too far. Quiet.
[3911.35s -> 3916.31s]  This is a fucking hard game. This enemy is in a really shitty place. He's got a ton of health
[3916.31s -> 3928.74s]  and he can, he can bounce you off. He can knock you off. Quiet. I got it. It's like the third
[3928.74s -> 3947.72s]  attempt. I should try killing it this time. I don't even want those. Who cares? I'm level 180.
[3947.72s -> 3950.52s]  This shouldn't be this. I'm kidding. People are going to leave and be like, this guy sucks. I'm
[3950.52s -> 3994.57s]  135. I'm going to fight him from here. Really? That's really bad. God. Why? Why? Why? Dude,
[3995.37s -> 4005.13s]  why? This one doesn't count. What's going on? I got to get out of the rod before it builds up.
[4005.85s -> 4008.07s]  Kill him with it on. Who cares?
[4015.56s -> 4057.42s]  What was that shit? One of those like puppet hands that came up. Get off you golden seed.
[4058.06s -> 4070.65s]  That's it. Okay. Well, that's, I mean, how many do I have? I think I have like three,
[4073.72s -> 4079.21s]  but it's five, right? Totally worth it. Actually, probably worth it.
[4080.01s -> 4082.33s]  Considering that I think that's the only place you can get those now.
[4083.05s -> 4098.79s]  Right. I think this is the only place I've seen. I'm just going to go back. There's plenty of other
[4098.79s -> 4114.38s]  places you can get. Wait, there are a lot more. Oh, okay. Which bonfire is this?
[4115.98s -> 4125.93s]  There's at least 10 surplus seeds. That makes sense though. Considering a kind of,
[4126.65s -> 4137.48s]  I don't have enough to level up. I think so. We've won 20 something.
[4138.28s -> 4145.35s]  That's close, but it's not there. Well, I'm going to lose all these runes that I just
[4145.35s -> 4183.13s]  broke for no reason. Wait. Oh, wait. This is like a castle? Like a town? Like what is down here?
[4183.13s -> 4190.60s]  What is this? This is a castle. This is the halib tree, but it's like a castle.
[4191.40s -> 4233.29s]  There's a safe place to go from here. Okay. I could go up. What's up here? Might as well.
[4238.14s -> 4262.98s]  Okay. A lot of places to go here. That's high. Did I overshoot that or did I undershoot it?
[4263.54s -> 4277.08s]  I tried not to overshoot it. Souls are not gone. There's no enemies here.
[4277.08s -> 4285.99s]  There's going to be stupid fall deaths that are what caused me to lose anything.
[4296.22s -> 4320.60s]  Okay. Come on. Chonished. I'm going to fuck it up. What the? Did I go? I went, I went through it.
[4320.60s -> 4326.36s]  My character went through it. I literally went through it. He phased through it.
[4326.92s -> 4336.78s]  He just did the exact same thing. Bro. I'm trying to land on the little banister thing.
[4338.63s -> 4349.08s]  I did. I undershoot it. I like went. I got to go a little bit further. Hurry up. Let's go.
[4349.80s -> 4363.82s]  My God. I'm rushing now because I don't want to fucking run over the stupid twigs anymore.
[4364.38s -> 4371.88s]  I don't want to like walk across the tightrope anymore.
[4377.46s -> 4381.46s]  I can't like this in games. Not like this where it's just like, okay, you got to go like that way
[4381.94s -> 4385.54s]  and then down that way and then that way. And then you where you were. Oh, just get,
[4385.54s -> 4389.62s]  I want to just drive a car there. I just want to get in a fucking car and drive here.
[4389.62s -> 4414.14s]  Give me in a plane and just fly it there. Just fly. Just speed hack it. I don't need the ruins.
[4414.14s -> 4434.86s]  Whatever. I can go walk. How are you? I was in the middle of an animation. That's not fair. What?
[4436.49s -> 4439.05s]  I was in the middle of an opening animation. That's not, that's not how that works.
[4439.93s -> 4444.76s]  What's the item? What's the item? Did he take it?
[4446.60s -> 4459.43s]  What's the item? It didn't show up on my screen. What is it? What is it? What is it?
[4459.43s -> 4466.81s]  You got it. What was it? I didn't even, it didn't even show up on the screen.
[4467.45s -> 4485.70s]  Is it talisman? Yes. Dragon crest. Enormously boost physical damage negation.
[4486.50s -> 4490.68s]  Legendary talisman of wrought iron depicting a massive ancient dragon.
[4491.48s -> 4495.18s]  The ancient dragons who ruled in the prehistoric era before the urd tree
[4495.82s -> 4501.50s]  would protect their lord as a wall of living rock. And so it is that the shape of the dragon
[4501.50s -> 4518.23s]  has become symbolic of all manner of protection. He's pretty good. He's very good. Okay. Um,
[4518.23s -> 4536.73s]  this deck is still down there that I said you can't even see me. You threw the guy.
[4536.73s -> 4570.39s]  What? My God, you're so annoying. Get out of there. This guy's got to die right now.
[4571.03s -> 4647.86s]  They're flying. I just go down. You lost. Yeah. The guy shoved me. Who's next to me? The ledges.
[4648.50s -> 4656.73s]  I don't have anything left in there.
[4659.37s -> 4690.87s]  My fucking socks. That was so far too. Jesus. To go back to the stinky dragon spot. Um,
[4690.87s -> 4696.79s]  I'm, I have progress this way. I need to, I want to get out of this piece of shit before I go back
[4696.79s -> 4704.01s]  to the rot village. Okay. I'm getting out of this piece of crap. I know I just, I said a little bit
[4704.01s -> 4725.27s]  of swear word there, but that was crap. Okay. What is this? I don't know. We're taking it though.
[4725.27s -> 4774.10s]  This one's going so fast. Oh shit. Nice. Lost store. All right. Here's a boss. What do we got?
[4774.10s -> 4824.86s]  Here we go. Cut scene. Everybody quiet. Oh, running. Great. Go run and kick that away.
[4824.86s -> 4828.06s]  That's like a gun in a movie where it like gets kicked away and everyone tries to go get it.
[4828.06s -> 4888.98s]  As I awaited his return, heed my words. I am millennia blade of Mickeler feet.
[4890.54s -> 4897.35s]  I am Jerma. Sword of everyone. Hey, you get to do what I do. That's not fair.
[4897.35s -> 4936.07s]  Fuck you. How dare you. God, that hurts. She's healing.
[4936.55s -> 5003.67s]  Do something. Come on. Nice. Bombo. Good. Good job. Very good.
[5025.21s -> 5037.85s]  Fucking healing shit. I caught this. Dude, she's healing off of them. She's going back up full L.
[5039.19s -> 5054.82s]  Okay. Um, he's back up full HB. I'm fucking flabbergasted. Uh, so what we have to do here
[5054.82s -> 5069.37s]  is we have to, uh, go back to full fucking health. Um, excuse X. It's coming out of my mouth.
[5069.37s -> 5101.53s]  Excuse me. I'm dead. So I didn't even hurt the boss. Did the boss was not even injured at all.
[5108.26s -> 5116.15s]  Bombo seems like free health in a way. I'm very curious how I'm going to do this. He's
[5116.15s -> 5164.46s]  to dodge every attack. Okay. Let's go. Oh, that's a bad, not bad idea. No magic.
[5165.26s -> 5180.14s]  Too slow. It's too slow. How long does it do that for sword? Like clicks up. Oh, yikes.
[5210.68s -> 5215.88s]  Boys and girls, baby rattles going to turn out to be quite a good pick here.
[5215.88s -> 5222.63s]  Oh, boys and girls, baby rattle is the weapon of choice.
[5223.51s -> 5247.99s]  You can't stand in the air that long. Is this a fucking cartoon? Is this a cartoon?
[5252.14s -> 5259.21s]  She was in the air. She jumped in the air and stood there up in the air. I was expecting her
[5259.21s -> 5265.77s]  to hold a fucking sign that just said like, Oh, and then fall. What the hell was that?
[5266.49s -> 5275.98s]  Fucking goddamn cartoon shit. All right. Baby rattle is unbelievable here because it
[5292.98s -> 5364.70s]  is sloppy. Very sloppy. Oh my fucking God. We're back to full fucking health.
[5365.42s -> 5424.97s]  I'm going to do something fucking weird like this. That was weird. Oh my God. All right. Even
[5424.97s -> 5428.49s]  though she's going to heal, I think Bombo's got to come out. We also might have to upgrade
[5428.49s -> 5459.96s]  Bombo to level 10. Let's go Bombo. Very good start. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that
[5459.96s -> 5488.84s]  stagger. No, fuck. There it is. Nice. Good hit. Is this even doing anything?
[5491.78s -> 5504.89s]  She's healing off of them. Oh my God. She's going to heal. Okay. So summons are not probably not
[5504.89s -> 5518.63s]  good because she's just going to farm health on them. Oh, that's right. Okay. If I'm not going
[5518.63s -> 5531.59s]  to be doing that much spells and we need to wait like jump. Do I have like a, what should I do here?
[5537.05s -> 5545.80s]  Shield one. I think it's really heavy though. Enormously boosts physical damage negation.
[5545.80s -> 5552.82s]  What about, um, FP? I don't really necessarily care about potentially like sorceries. What about
[5553.86s -> 5558.28s]  does it matter? Does she do magic damage or something? What is she doing? Rod?
[5563.46s -> 5577.83s]  Raid? I don't see. Is there a raid? No, it's physical. Okay. So
[5578.87s -> 5584.71s]  arch attacks, stamina reducing attacks. Maybe it's HP. Just greatly raise max HP.
[5585.59s -> 5596.22s]  That seems kind of cool. All right. Let me try that. And I'm also going to move flasks around.
[5596.78s -> 5608.38s]  Let me just try it. Just purely trying to fight rune arc. I am not going to use a rune arc yet
[5608.38s -> 5618.15s]  because I'm not confident enough that I'm not going to die in 13 seconds. I also probably
[5618.15s -> 5651.37s]  should change my wondrous physique as well. All right, let's go. No summons. Fuck you. Fuck you.
[5651.37s -> 5767.74s]  Fuck you. Thank God. Eat shit. Hey. Top myself off. Oh shit. No. No. My God. Fuck. Jesus Christ.
[5768.62s -> 5775.70s]  Oh, that was so good too. Oh, that sucks. Holy shit. This is unbearable. What?
[5780.55s -> 5791.30s]  One mistake and it's over. That was a really clean like first minute or two. Holy shit.
[5793.98s -> 5803.83s]  If you one wrong input, it's over. Holy fucking moly. All right. Come on. Holy moly.
[5804.47s -> 5822.20s]  It's got to be fucking aggressive by the aggressive. That's sloppy fucking beginning.
[5822.20s -> 5843.29s]  That's sloppy shit right there. I had no stamina to dodge. Quiet. Yikes, man. She's
[5843.29s -> 5856.89s]  already back to fucking full health. Is this even possible to beat? Is this even physically
[5856.89s -> 5872.10s]  completable? No one's beat this in the world. I saw the achievement pop up. It's at 0.0%.
[5873.22s -> 5878.02s]  I was wondering. I thought it was a bug or something. 0.0% of people have beat this.
[5879.67s -> 5904.47s]  Geez. We're that smart to get away from that. God. It's okay. When she goes shriek,
[5904.47s -> 5907.83s]  you got to just get away. Just dodge right immediately. Right when you hear the sound.
[5924.95s -> 5936.14s]  Fuck you. Oh fucking hell. You have to be perfect at this fight. Oh my God, dude.
[5937.02s -> 5970.23s]  This is going to take 10 hours of memorizing this whole fight without a doubt. What? Didn't swing.
[5970.95s -> 5997.78s]  It's so long. Like one, two, three, four seconds. Stop fucking swinging. Oh my God.
[6005.11s -> 6016.58s]  Holy shit, this is insane. Yeah, I'm trying, man. This is the boss that people said. Some people
[6016.58s -> 6027.80s]  took like 10 days on this person. Okay. I'm doing it. It's probably a phase two as well. This is
[6027.80s -> 6034.86s]  going to be so awful, isn't it? We're throwing caution to the goddamn wind.
[6035.82s -> 6038.50s]  We're doing a full on burger boy technique right now.
[6045.66s -> 6062.28s]  Consumables? Are you guys actually voting to see if I'm going to do this in 15 tries?
[6062.92s -> 6070.12s]  Add a zero. 15 tries? No. No, I'm telling you, this is going to be like a hundred.
[6072.76s -> 6076.49s]  I don't know how I would have voted for that one. All right, here we go.
[6077.21s -> 6125.56s]  You fucking idiot. Seriously? Really? Shit.
[6125.56s -> 6131.75s]  What? There's a lot of time to swing after that.
[6138.62s -> 6155.82s]  That was the one thing you could have done to avoid that. No fucking way. Not a chance now.
[6155.82s -> 6166.10s]  Oh my fucking Lord. I didn't get grabbed. I thought I did. What is this? Did she dodge this?
[6167.38s -> 6205.72s]  Oh, there's no fucking panel left. Hold on a minute. I've got an idea. I have an idea.
[6205.72s -> 6227.78s]  This is going to work. We're doing. Okay. Watch this shit. Randy's moon. And we're going.
[6227.78s -> 6232.10s]  I'm just going to bully. I think I can actually bring out serpent for this.
[6232.10s -> 6236.26s]  I'm going hard for this one. Here we go. This is going to be a nightmare, but let's do it.
[6236.26s -> 6250.90s]  Here we go. You guys ready for a nightmare? Moon. Three. Or two. I will take two. Two moons?
[6251.80s -> 6254.60s]  Oh my God. Just two moons. Just sit her into a moon.
[6262.86s -> 6268.41s]  Okay. All right. All right. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. We have to bully immediately.
[6268.41s -> 6283.85s]  Don't let her swing. Don't let her swing. Oh my God. What is that? What just happened?
[6283.85s -> 6291.34s]  I don't even know what happened. She got mad. Oh, that's the play though. That's going to work.
[6296.46s -> 6301.02s]  That is the play. It's just get in there and just absolutely stagger and bully.
[6301.58s -> 6330.44s]  Let's do it. She's in there somewhere. All right. Get her. Get her. Get her. Get her.
[6330.44s -> 6333.48s]  Don't let her do anything weird. Don't let her do anything weird. Get her.
[6337.08s -> 6342.68s]  Burger Boy technique. All right. Back up. Back up. No reason to get killed here.
[6343.40s -> 6348.04s]  We're going full Burger Boy. Who cares? Just kill her.
[6369.61s -> 6376.87s]  Back up. Back up. There's no way this works, right? There's no way. There's a phase two in there.
[6380.68s -> 6386.54s]  Ow. My face. Just phase two. This is going to be a phase two. This is going to be a phase two.
[6388.39s -> 6391.11s]  Oh, she's going to rip her arm off. She's going to turn into a zombie.
[6393.70s -> 6398.58s]  She's going to turn into a monster. It's a fucking phase two fight. I was so confident for no reason.
[6399.54s -> 6408.71s]  God damn it. Okay. So that works for phase one. Phase...
[6409.86s -> 6415.54s]  What do you mean no way? That was it? No. No, it's not. Why would there be a cut scene?
[6419.94s -> 6426.65s]  That works for phase one. Okay. That's very effective for phase one.
[6426.65s -> 6429.29s]  But oh God. I knew it. Right. There's no way.
[6429.29s -> 6460.76s]  Okay. Bombo, I think we're going to have to try a little harder. Bombo, you and me. Good luck.
[6486.62s -> 6493.98s]  Bombo, it's been a pleasure doing business with you. What the fuck? She exploded.
[6495.82s -> 6522.52s]  Bombo. Bombo, don't go in there. Bombo. Bombo, no. My game is frozen.
[6523.32s -> 6550.54s]  Okay. Well, we have a reliable way to get to... Let's let's do this smartly. I want more spell
[6550.54s -> 6562.62s]  damage. Less... I want sorceries. Boosting sorceries. Get Bombo to 10. Yes. That's exactly what we're
[6562.62s -> 6572.55s]  going to do right now. Do I have any runes? I don't. How much does it cost to get you to 10?
[6576.31s -> 6590.54s]  And use a rune arc? Still doing that. Okay. Wait, I can't see you. Wait, I gotta sell.
[6591.18s -> 6601.54s]  I gotta sell something. I'm thinking rune arc. Get Bombo to 10. I need to just sell like some
[6601.54s -> 6614.60s]  route. What do I have? No junk. How much does it cost? Fuck. Shit. I just gotta go kill a few
[6614.60s -> 6622.23s]  things. Sell your... Do not sell the grease. Do I have a lord's rune? I didn't see it. Yeah,
[6622.23s -> 6632.97s]  I don't have it. I'm just gonna go kill a couple things. Use rune arcs. Uh, let me just go here.
[6632.97s -> 6642.84s]  This'll be easy. That... That fight is crazy. It's really just... I honestly... No, no, no. We're not...
[6642.84s -> 6650.04s]  We're not just like dodging around and dashing around. Nope. That is a DPS race. That is a kill
[6650.04s -> 6658.90s]  her as fast as possible. Don't let her do any moves. Where's an easy place for me to get? Oh,
[6658.90s -> 6667.27s]  I know. That mog place. Where is it? It's like right here somewhere. All right.
[6668.23s -> 6676.90s]  Dermot, you're never going to beat this boss. I feel like I got... I feel like I got close enough.
[6676.90s -> 6702.60s]  I think it's... I think I can do it. All I need is like 10 bombs. But yeah, the sorcery boosting
[6702.60s -> 6710.74s]  talisman... If I just go for straight up just DPS, go for it. I think it's gonna be pretty
[6710.74s -> 6719.86s]  possible. I think it's gonna be okay. I also think that I need mana. Eels are very good, but
[6719.86s -> 6726.71s]  I don't want to run out, because that would be a disaster if I did. Okay, let's go get Mambo to 10.
[6737.02s -> 6752.50s]  There you are. Here we go. Mambo plus 10. I guess I had more
[6753.30s -> 6759.05s]  runes than I needed. We're also going to take a rune arc. Wait, what do I have on for a rune right
[6759.05s -> 6777.03s]  now? What's the best one I can put on for this? Odric is good. HP, FP, and stamina. I feel like
[6777.03s -> 6802.26s]  that's not bad. Greatly raises max HP. I'm gonna... I'll try Redan's. That's not very... That's not
[6802.26s -> 6813.11s]  that much. It doesn't seem like very much. Okay, well, let's go for it. I am as prepared as I'm
[6813.11s -> 6820.57s]  going to be at this point. Morgoth's is better. Well, I got this on right now. Redan's sucks.
[6823.93s -> 6843.75s]  All right, it's... Right here. Use Godric's. I mean, I already used it. Okay, here we go.
[6844.31s -> 6849.61s]  Let's try it. The same technique. Getting in there, and we are just bully, bully, bully, bully,
[6849.61s -> 6854.33s]  bully. Don't do anything else. Bully. Bully. That's it. We're not doing it. We're just bullying.
[6869.90s -> 6909.86s]  Get in there. Stagger. Come on. Keep it up. Get in. And go. Good. Good. Mambo, help.
[6910.18s -> 6933.27s]  Oh, she did it three times in a row. She did that same dumbass move two or three times in a row.
[6933.91s -> 6979.16s]  I lost the rune arc. I don't even need it. Fuck it. I don't want it. Not that one. Here we go.
[6979.16s -> 7009.53s]  Get it. Mambo, you got to get any closer, man. Come on. Fucking Jesus. Not a good... This is a bad
[7009.53s -> 7052.14s]  start. You did that move so early. Zone, zone. Good zone, Mambo. Good zoning. Oh, my God. She
[7052.14s -> 7077.91s]  just kicked the shit out of him. Oh, please. Nice. God damn it. He's dead. Okay. All right. We got
[7077.91s -> 7110.95s]  to phase two for the second time. I'm ready. Oh, my God. It explodes. What the fuck? What the fuck?
[7110.95s -> 7125.56s]  She doesn't come down. She stays up there. I'm just going to run. I saw her come down,
[7125.56s -> 7132.78s]  but that was just a stupid fucking phantom. All right. No more rune arcs until I can reliably
[7132.78s -> 7141.66s]  know what she's going to do in phase two. This is... Oh, my goodness. This is fucking awkward.
[7147.40s -> 7166.28s]  Get that backwards. I just couldn't fucking see. I'll be honest. There's so much red shit on the
[7166.28s -> 7193.27s]  screen. We got to keep Mambo alive. That's the stupidest fucking move we've ever made.
[7196.97s -> 7206.52s]  Do you just have to turn around and run? It does it three times. There's no way you can get her.
[7206.52s -> 7213.02s]  You cannot dodge that. You just turn around and run. There's so many attack animations in
[7213.02s -> 7236.30s]  one second. What's that fucking horse shit? Come on. I need you to get in there.
[7246.50s -> 7268.49s]  Good start. Run. It happened so quickly. That move happened so fast. How are you supposed to do that?
[7274.62s -> 7288.12s]  Holy... That's stupid. If she goes in the air, just run. Dumbass shit right there. That is dumbass
[7288.12s -> 7302.25s]  shit. Okay, if she goes in the air, run across the entire game. Okay, I got it.
[7312.10s -> 7318.70s]  If she went in the air for that, it's a different move. Mambo, I need you over here.
[7319.34s -> 7367.26s]  Now I'm paranoid that she's going to do it. Zoning. Back up. No, I didn't. She's actually
[7367.26s -> 7389.74s]  doing it to Mambo. It's all right. Poor Mambo. Oh, my God. I need Mambo for phase two so bad.
[7390.22s -> 7405.85s]  Come on, miss the fucking stun. She's right. It's so intense. It's hard to even fucking pay
[7405.85s -> 7412.60s]  attention. There's so much going on that she can do. Holy shit. It's so difficult to pay attention
[7412.60s -> 7417.13s]  to that. It's just like, oh, my God. She's in the air and then it's too late. It's like your brain
[7417.13s -> 7465.24s]  is like, oh, fuck. Okay, too late. Let's try it again. This is perfect. No, it's not. No, fucking
[7465.24s -> 7472.02s]  too late. Oh, my God. Damn it. Please. Thank God she didn't kill Mambo with that. That's actually
[7472.02s -> 7498.86s]  good. Keep her there. Get her, Mambo. Come on. Jesus. No. Mambo, stop her. Stop her, please.
[7510.76s -> 7521.90s]  This is un-fucking-believably difficult. They're going to nerf this one, too.
[7522.78s -> 7526.86s]  They're going to fight both these bosses, Verdan and this one, before they fucking nerf it twice.
[7545.35s -> 7572.68s]  Didn't get her. It's actually really hard to see. My God. That sucks. Mambo's going to die.
[7572.84s -> 7633.91s]  Really quick. Dude. Excuse me. I ran the whole fucking time. Hey. Whoa. Is she going to go in
[7633.91s -> 7660.12s]  the air? I'm so fucking afraid she's going to go in the air and ruin the whole thing. I need you
[7660.12s -> 7672.38s]  for phase two. She's still alive. What the hell? She's fucking healing. Damn it, man. That's such
[7672.38s -> 7688.73s]  a shit mechanic. Oh, my God. I can't fucking kill her. All right. Now what do I do?
[7692.02s -> 7708.04s]  Oh, my God. Okay. So she goes in the air. She comes down and then she explodes. How many seconds
[7708.04s -> 7731.05s]  later? Two? Will that still hit you if you roll? So you have to just do like two good perfect dodges.
[7732.49s -> 7734.49s]  I'm going to start to hear this fucking music in my head.
[7736.78s -> 7776.39s]  Don't go in the air. I have nowhere to run. Oh, my God. She's coming for me.
[7776.95s -> 7823.85s]  What the fuck? I don't know where she's going. No. He got it. All right. Come on. Dodge. It's
[7823.85s -> 7835.03s]  going to be a good dodge. Fuck. There's Scarlet Rye everywhere. There's Scarlet Rye all over me.
[7845.82s -> 7879.34s]  Is it the same move that she does? I don't know, dude. Oh, no. Oh, no. She does it. Oh, no.
[7880.30s -> 7888.41s]  Oh, she does two different things. She goes in the air now. She does two of those. She hung up
[7888.41s -> 7899.00s]  and didn't do it. Oh, my goodness. What level am I? 135. Should I just come back here at like
[7899.00s -> 7907.03s]  180 and just kill her? She does five different things. I have to float it. I'm just running
[7907.03s -> 7942.17s]  every time. This sucks. This sucks so bad. You can't. You can't. I need more bully from you.
[7943.13s -> 7949.29s]  Oh, she's doing it. That's so, dude. I got to fucking seriously. I honestly like it's like,
[7949.29s -> 7955.02s]  holy shit. I just like you get you get so into the fight and it's just so much going on.
[7955.58s -> 7958.86s]  So much fucking colors on the screen that like she goes in the air and it's like, oh, fuck.
[7959.74s -> 7962.70s]  I'm just going to shoot me in the face with the cannon. I can't fucking do anything.
[7966.58s -> 7969.14s]  Use the mimic tear. They nerfed that motherfucker. It's not worth it.
[7975.93s -> 7981.29s]  This is the strategy for phase two. God, I have no fucking goddamn idea how you're supposed to
[7981.29s -> 7987.11s]  reliably do that. This is just I don't think I don't know how to fucking do that. Dude,
[7987.11s -> 7991.75s]  some of these like speed run like no damage runs. Oh, my God. This is going to suck. Absolute
[7991.75s -> 8015.27s]  asshole. It's going to be fucking horrible. Dude, even when you fucking run, it don't matter.
[8015.27s -> 8051.74s]  I'm terrified. We're going in the air. If you're mid attack animation like this, it's fucking
[8051.74s -> 8113.03s]  horrible. Oh, come on. Get out of here. All right. Come on. Get it. Don't let her go in the air.
[8114.52s -> 8132.81s]  Consistent. God, you piece of shit. Just get hit. Um, thank you, mom. I can't fucking hit her.
[8133.45s -> 8170.02s]  Can I go near her? Where is she? I have no stamina to fucking move away from her.
[8171.74s -> 8187.26s]  I'm out of fucking stamina. Oh, no way, man. Oh, shit. I don't. I'm fucking dead. Oh, my God.
[8187.26s -> 8206.86s]  I ran out of stamina. Use a shield. Oh, my God. That sucked. How much stamina do I have?
[8207.42s -> 8215.56s]  20 endurance. Yeah, but I need to try the boys. I feel like the boys are going to be free food.
[8216.20s -> 8231.72s]  Use the boom blade. I'm not even I don't I don't know, man. I got to like get to phase two and not
[8232.44s -> 8237.88s]  ever spam that move the first five seconds. Like I need to be I got to see what she does in that
[8237.88s -> 8241.48s]  encounter. I'm just going to run away from her. If I get to phase two here, I'm literally I'm
[8241.48s -> 8244.44s]  not going to attack. I'm literally going to run around in a circle and see what she does.
[8245.56s -> 8249.88s]  And what was so un-fucking-variable that like even if you're remotely close, you're fucked.
[8250.60s -> 8267.78s]  Jesus, the timing is so fucked up. This is the hardest boss of any from fucking without a doubt
[8267.78s -> 8273.98s]  in my mind. Million percent. I thought the end of Sekiro was fucking horrible. At least like I had
[8273.98s -> 8282.18s]  a at least you can like fucking you have like a button to stop attacks. I think this takes the
[8282.18s -> 8294.78s]  cake. Like that L1. This is a Sekiro boss without the parry mechanic. I think she accidentally got
[8294.78s -> 8305.64s]  in this fucking game. I don't think she's supposed to be here. They like accidentally put the wrong
[8305.64s -> 8396.42s]  asset in here. I'm so paranoid of that move. I don't even want to like fight her. Dude, fuck you
[8396.42s -> 8406.68s]  with this fucking gap closing bullshit. Oh, come on now. God damn it. All these gap closes. Where's
[8406.68s -> 8437.83s]  my fucking Sekiro L1? Wrong game. Wrong game from software. Wrong game. He's going crazy. I'm
[8437.83s -> 8443.11s]  going to turn him out, man. Fuck me. Fuck. I'm going to hack my game and fucking get 10,000 damage.
[8443.11s -> 8468.54s]  I'm just going to kill her with one hit. Get her in the fire. Ugly. Ugly. She's going to go in the air.
[8468.54s -> 8473.26s]  I just know it. It's just like, fuck, you don't know when she's going to go in the goddamn air.
[8474.14s -> 8496.04s]  And it's like, man, you better not be within fucking 100 yards of her. Fucking leave me alone.
[8496.04s -> 8572.82s]  Jesus Christ. I was stupid, but I'm going to do it. No. Why did that not stagger? Oh, fuck. Come on.
[8572.82s -> 8589.00s]  No. Get back. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. All right. What are you? What are your moves?
[8589.80s -> 8601.18s]  What are your moves? Oh my God. She's doing that thing. It's different. What? That was different.
[8601.18s -> 8625.29s]  She didn't do the thing. That was different. No attack. Please. New moves so I can learn what
[8625.29s -> 8644.42s]  you do. Please get away from me. I'm such a coward. I don't care. Oh, it's over. Goodbye. Dude.
[8646.70s -> 8656.87s]  My genuine scared face. There's not even enough time for me to change to my other potions. You
[8656.87s -> 8670.98s]  know what I mean? Like, fuck this. It's more, it's like a lot, it's been really drifty and floating.
[8671.94s -> 8707.18s]  Please. Shit. Shit. Oh my God. There's no time. Oh my God. What are you supposed to do? There's
[8707.18s -> 8722.18s]  no time. There's no time. There's no time. There's no time. By the time she finishes that move,
[8722.82s -> 8732.28s]  she's doing it again. What the fuck, dude? You should use your melee art. Dude, I'm going to do
[8732.28s -> 8742.86s]  that and die instantly. I don't think I can do, I think that move is too slow. I think I just have
[8742.86s -> 8753.86s]  to fight her. Fucking drugs were they taking when they made this, by the way? Oh, here's a good idea.
[8753.86s -> 8759.14s]  A fight where the boss heals every time she hits you. Oh, and by the way, there's a move that
[8759.14s -> 8765.06s]  goes across the entire fucking boss area. She's got no stamina bar. She swings faster than all
[8765.06s -> 8771.85s]  the bosses in Sekiro. Were they, were they smoking crack when they made this? How much crack were
[8771.85s -> 8826.41s]  they on? This is crack. All right, settle down. I'm fine. She's going to do it. She's going to do it.
[8828.04s -> 8832.87s]  She's just, she wants to do it so badly. A little, the math problem going on in her little fucking
[8832.87s -> 8869.42s]  brain is being like, should I do the thing? Maybe. Nice job. Oh, killer quick. She annihilated him.
[8869.42s -> 8890.33s]  She fucking annihilated him, man. I'm so paranoid that she's going to go in the air and it's over.
[8891.29s -> 8958.02s]  Oh my God, it's over. Oh my God, that's so broken. Oh my God. I even tried to run, dude.
[8963.90s -> 8967.90s]  Mambo phase two, that's probably, but I gotta get through phase one.
[8968.78s -> 8979.10s]  Mambo is going to stay alive for phase two. He didn't run. Guys, she does a move that takes like
[8979.18s -> 8986.15s]  12 seconds to end. And she jumps in the air and does it within like half a second. If you're
[8986.15s -> 8993.03s]  already in the gap, it's fucking over. And when, if you're too far away, you can't fight her.
[8993.03s -> 9005.62s]  If you're too close, you're fucked. How do you win? What's the strat? I need to get a shield.
[9005.62s -> 9018.22s]  Guys, my dude, my dude can't fucking handle it. I think I need Mambo for phase one. Otherwise,
[9018.22s -> 9049.50s]  I don't know if I can reliably get through this. Bro, I can't see you when you're doing that in
[9049.50s -> 9073.53s]  front of me. Hit her please, Mambo. Please do your little stretchy thing and hit her. Don't let her
[9073.53s -> 9103.99s]  get any mana off you. No, she's building mana. Don't let her, I'll get her. No shit. Oh no.
[9104.87s -> 9162.62s]  Mambo get her. There are other people in this fight, you know. What the fuck?
[9162.62s -> 9193.80s]  No fucking shot. No fucking shot. No shot. No shot. That's not possible. She runs faster than
[9193.80s -> 9202.22s]  you. She does more moves per second than you can move. She's got the biggest gap closers of anybody
[9202.22s -> 9217.85s]  I've ever seen. What a piece of shit. Look shit faced. I look fucking drunk right now.
[9217.85s -> 9223.05s]  Dude, I know. Okay, I understand. Like just dodge, just dodge. Being perfect in a soul is like,
[9223.05s -> 9228.33s]  this is a fucking from software game. Why am I saying that? You can't be perfect, man. Like,
[9228.33s -> 9237.19s]  it's just too hard. It's too much. But even if you were perfect, I want to like watch that clip
[9237.19s -> 9246.38s]  of what just happened. Because goddamn, it's like attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,
[9246.38s -> 9251.82s]  attack, attack. It's not time to do anything. You can't, you physically cannot do anything
[9251.82s -> 9260.20s]  because I just get hit. Watch somebody do a no hit of this. They're, they're fucking, they're,
[9260.20s -> 9305.61s]  they're working in slow motion. I already went over that. Oh fuck me. Thank god. I love when he
[9305.61s -> 9335.99s]  hits her. It sounds like a trash can lid. He's using a trash can. No, don't go for me, please.
[9336.95s -> 9347.27s]  I'll never turn you back on mombo. Big fucking mistake. I don't have the stamina. I might have.
[9365.02s -> 9426.07s]  Oh shit. Fine. Oh boy. Bro. This is shit. Oh damn it. Fuck you, dude. Jesus Christ.
[9426.07s -> 9449.48s]  What the fuck? What? Panic roll. Those are the amount of rolls you have to do to not get hit by
[9449.48s -> 9464.12s]  that dumb fucking. That's so fucking annoying. This piece of shit is dead eventually. And we're
[9464.12s -> 9473.02s]  going to eat one of these. Oh, I'm so mad. This sucks. This sucks. This sucks. This sucks.
[9473.98s -> 9533.78s]  I had no stamina to run. I hate when you do this shit. I can do something. Do something. What are
[9533.78s -> 9588.50s]  you a player in PVP? Fuck off. I thought he just cut her head off. Please help me and kill her.
[9588.50s -> 9637.62s]  Please help me. Get out of the rock. Get out of the rock. Fuck you. Oh fuck. It's so much slower.
[9638.50s -> 9675.45s]  Oh my god. I thought it was the yellow one. Is it? What one is it? Dude, the fact that she goes in
[9675.61s -> 9680.33s]  the air and she does two different fucking moves. She does the like, here I am floating.
[9682.17s -> 9691.00s]  Or, or it's like, whoosh. How are you supposed to tell? How are you supposed to tell?
[9691.56s -> 9695.72s]  How are you supposed to fucking tell? Different poses. Oh yeah. She goes, instead of going like
[9695.72s -> 9727.43s]  this, she goes like this. This is stupid. I think it's a hundred degrees in this room.
[9728.39s -> 9737.96s]  I'm like being cooked in here. I'm being cooked alive in here. If there was a piece of meat on my
[9737.96s -> 9743.26s]  shoulder, it would be turning brown. It would be, it would be like browning. It would be like, oh,
[9743.26s -> 9888.02s]  I could probably eat it. This fight sucks. Oh fuck. God damn it. I don't know how many fucking
[9888.02s -> 9895.30s]  people do that. And she's doing the fucking thing again. Oh my god. I couldn't even see.
[9896.26s -> 9915.90s]  Goodness. Too many moves. They're going to take away one of those swings. It's so fucked up.
[9919.58s -> 9934.39s]  Mambo for phase two only. I'll try that. Can I even do that though? I feel like I'm gonna get my ass
[9934.39s -> 9942.09s]  kicked right now. No, I don't want to listen. I'm not using the stupid mimic tier. Quiet.
[9943.37s -> 10016.49s]  I demand silence. Oh fuck. No, I forgot what that move was for a second. Yeah. I forgot. I like
[10016.49s -> 10020.81s]  forgot that because I didn't have Mambo. Like this is the first time I have seen and heard
[10020.89s -> 10031.10s]  without Mambo. And like, I just forgot. So when From Software makes another game,
[10032.12s -> 10037.72s]  right? What are they? What do they do? Did they just? Okay. Does the next game? It's like,
[10037.72s -> 10041.83s]  oh, we have to do something harder than millennia. The two hands come out of the
[10041.83s -> 10048.73s]  fucking screen and just choke you and just push on your trachea. What's next? What do they do?
[10049.45s -> 10054.92s]  You know what I mean? Like, oh yeah, I'm at the final boss. Oh, wow. One of the final bosses of,
[10055.56s -> 10064.68s]  of, uh, just slash arc. Wow. I'm here. Let's see about these hands. Whoa, guys, do you see these
[10064.68s -> 10087.78s]  hands? Oh, I dodged. Fight the fucking hands. What's next? Like, what the fuck is next?
[10091.85s -> 10100.17s]  Oh, yeah. From Software's new game is called Nut Kick. Oh, oh, like something just kicks me
[10100.17s -> 10109.70s]  in the balls from under the desk. What else are they going to do? How are they going to do
[10109.70s -> 10130.46s]  anything else? It spells in here. It fucking spells in here. I can tell on you right now. It
[10130.46s -> 10151.29s]  stinks in here. Not kidding. No, I didn't shit my pants. Imagine setting up. Oh, yeah. This game,
[10151.29s -> 10156.57s]  Nut Kick. Yeah. It's like a thing down here. I just like sit there and here comes the boss.
[10157.53s -> 10167.91s]  Why would you set that up? Why would you wouldn't even buy it? Oh, fuck. I'm going to die.
[10168.95s -> 10189.21s]  I'm fucking dead. This one's a real try right here. Everyone warned me. Oh, hey, dude. I know
[10189.21s -> 10193.85s]  you're like, yeah. Hey, by the way, like going there at 150, by the way, don't, hey, listen,
[10193.85s -> 10198.09s]  fucking do. Don't listen to these fucking idiots in the chat, man. I'm telling you,
[10198.81s -> 10203.85s]  be a fucking level 150. Get your fucking vigor up to fucking like 60. That's how I did it,
[10203.85s -> 10207.37s]  dude. Don't fucking listen to these dudes. They're trying to get you killed and they think it's funny
[10207.37s -> 10213.21s]  when you die. Look, trust me, I'm a fucking nut kick pro. I just sit there and let it kick me.
[10215.11s -> 10222.38s]  Listen to me. I got all the fucking tips. I did world first get a nut kick fucking a hundred times.
[10223.88s -> 10232.41s]  Yeah, that's me. I got that. I got that. I got that. Why am I just doing
[10232.73s -> 10236.09s]  this? I think I might be out of it. I think I might have to take a break.
[10236.09s -> 10274.76s]  This might be break time. Oh, here it comes. Oh, I'm going to go for the record.
[10306.25s -> 10320.26s]  I'm going to turn the fan up. Okay. So what went wrong there? There's too many, so many memes
[10320.26s -> 10328.97s]  tonight. Oh, sorry. G four rated. Are you still here? I hope not. I hope that. I hope not. Thanks
[10328.97s -> 10334.25s]  for the brain. That's like an hour and a half ago. That was two hours ago. My thing. Am I saying
[10334.25s -> 10342.33s]  thanks for the raid to G four, two and a half fucking hours later. Are you drunk? We'll bring
[10342.33s -> 10348.41s]  it out. Mambo prefers wrong is whatever. I'm pissed. It was four hours ago. How long have I been here?
[10349.77s -> 10381.85s]  Come on, Mambo, get in there. That actually is. Oh, no, she's got it. That sucks when she does it
[10381.85s -> 10399.03s]  to Mambo because then Mambo is not going to be around for the second phase. She's almost back
[10399.03s -> 10532.71s]  to full health again. Again. Oh, come on. Oh my God. I couldn't. I'm trying to change my fucking
[10532.71s -> 10543.62s]  sword. Oh my God, dude. Like holding. Like I got a fucking complaint. Like holding Y and hit R one
[10543.62s -> 10549.48s]  to go to the two hand man. Sometimes like it just like fucking is weird. It doesn't like happen in
[10549.48s -> 10554.12s]  the lower left. It doesn't like say, oh, you're holding Y. It just thinks you're tapping Y.
[10555.08s -> 10581.48s]  I mean, like you have to switch your weapon. You have to like one. It's like a full second
[10581.48s -> 10608.87s]  that you have to hold it. It's like, hold. There it is. Hold. There it is. You're already running.
[10608.87s -> 10614.95s]  What's this bullshit? You never run. You knew I used a rune arc. You piece of shit. Shit. Shit.
[10615.51s -> 10640.70s]  Shit. Shit. What was that? You piece of shit. You missed. I'm going to shit my pants.
[10641.90s -> 10662.95s]  I give this one more try and I'm going to do it. What time is it? Don't shit your pants. I'm done
[10662.95s -> 10667.83s]  if I want to. And I might, I just might. I might just fucking, you know what I mean? Like just
[10668.79s -> 10718.71s]  you can't see what's happening in that fight. I'm just freaking out, man. What are you doing?
[10718.71s -> 10735.14s]  Don't do it. One of us has to fucking do something. So no, I forgot. I'm so I can't,
[10736.25s -> 10741.13s]  I can't even fucking man. That's like my brain is just like, for some reason I thought like she was
[10741.13s -> 10761.70s]  in phase two was going to do the swoop. Last one. This is the last one. This is ridiculous.
[10764.98s -> 10789.61s]  This is like truly a fucked up encounter. This is fucked up. Holy. Holy. She's not actually right.
[10792.15s -> 10818.46s]  Nice camera. Oh, there she is. I found her. Okay. One, two, three, go. You're scary. I'm not scary.
[10818.46s -> 10830.97s]  I'm having fun. Not having any. I'm not. What are you, why do you call me a horror fight?
[10831.53s -> 10837.53s]  It's a, what? You didn't see anybody go. Oh, what the heck? Oh shit. I'm lost in dark souls.
[10837.53s -> 10844.09s]  What the fuck, dude? It's scary. I'm not the only person that's done this. There are tons of us get
[10844.09s -> 10849.45s]  very heated and very upset at these games. I don't know what you're on about because I know for a
[10849.45s -> 10879.66s]  fact that at least there's no way I would be able to do this when I'm 40. No. Okay. Okay. Here's the
[10879.66s -> 10885.02s]  thing, guys. Listen to me. If FromSoftware comes out with another game in like four years and I'm
[10885.02s -> 10889.10s]  still screaming, we're just going to skip that one. We're just going to skip that. I'm not going to
[10889.10s -> 10893.98s]  be able to do it when I'm 40. I don't know. This is the last time that I think I'll be able to beat
[10893.98s -> 10903.67s]  like a fucking FromSoftware boss. When I'm 40 years old, I'm going to be like, I'm going to have to
[10903.67s -> 10926.26s]  count when I dodge. You know what I mean? Like one, two. All right, let's go. Good luck to all of you.
[10927.06s -> 10931.70s]  Good luck to all of you sorry motherfuckers that are going to have to play the next FromSoftware
[10931.70s -> 10939.54s]  game and go up against Melina the maggot and deal with the harder boss they make.
[10939.54s -> 10951.82s]  It's going to be harder than this. Go luck. I'm going to be on the sidelines. I'm going to be like,
[10951.82s -> 10962.47s]  oh shit, man, I'm glad I'm 40 and I don't have to do this. What happened? I wasn't even looking.
[10964.28s -> 11040.73s]  Wait, did I win? They need more. No, not again. Not again. Get in there, Mambo. Come on. Come on,
[11040.73s -> 11065.53s]  son. Come on, son. God, it's like you can't. It's so hard to see them. One does like a thrust.
[11065.53s -> 11071.61s]  There's like three that are like one, two, three thrust. The thrust one is like it comes like from
[11071.61s -> 11083.29s]  here. Oh, this sucks such ass. It's past your bedtime. No, it's not. This is the actual last
[11083.29s -> 11111.22s]  try. You take too much damage, then you die. Um, no, not really. Yeah, I didn't even see it.
[11111.94s -> 11147.26s]  Too much stuff on the screen. He's going to die for that. That sucks, man. I like need him for phase
[11147.26s -> 11227.86s]  two. I'd rather she do that to me. Keep at it. Oh, this is bad news. Really bad. I was such a bad
[11227.86s -> 11238.10s]  spot. Oh my God. Like how, man, I was just underneath her. More roll, dude. It's just that
[11238.10s -> 11244.87s]  move is fucking impossible to get away from. I was like right there as you just too close.
[11244.87s -> 11250.84s]  I could dodge through it, but then you go dodge through it like three or four times and not get
[11250.84s -> 11275.77s]  hit at all. I want to beat this, but it's so un-fucking-bearable. That's un-fucking-bearable.
[11279.08s -> 11289.86s]  No, you need the cheering and inspiration. I need the boss not to 10,000 animations
[11290.66s -> 11295.80s]  before I get to drink out of my flask. That wasn't to you. That was a great, that was towards
[11295.80s -> 11299.88s]  Melina. It was towards Melina. It was not towards you. I'm going to make that very clear.
[11300.68s -> 11314.31s]  That was a growl towards Melina. Very upset with her. I'm just going with my eyes closed.
[11314.31s -> 11318.23s]  Fuck it. Who cares? This boss sucks. I'll as well try to do it without fucking looking.
[11357.27s -> 11397.85s]  What's happening? I thought that was me that died. What happened? What? What the fuck happened?
[11398.65s -> 11414.86s]  He was stuck in the corner. Oh, I was like, why am I alive for this long?
[11417.02s -> 11424.74s]  Jump over that move. Write that down and put it on the wiki. I look fucking horrible.
[11425.46s -> 11449.83s]  I need more stamina. I need, I'm going to respect him. I'm going to respect him.
[11450.87s -> 11470.15s]  I'm just fucking around now. Get a bleed weapon. I don't want to go get the mimic tier.
[11470.15s -> 11476.23s]  Go get a plus 10 bleed weapon. Sit in the corner. Fire arrows at her in phase one.
[11477.03s -> 11481.83s]  Go get the summon that is like the cheese for this and just stand there and win for free.
[11482.63s -> 11516.90s]  What the fuck happened here? Travelers close? What do I do now? You're already doing a cheese
[11516.90s -> 11524.34s]  strat. What difference does it make if you do another cheese strat? Okay. You came in here with
[11524.98s -> 11534.02s]  10 dex, 10 strength. Do 10 vitality, 40 endurance, and you dodged every single attack and you did
[11534.26s -> 11543.77s]  14 damage a swing. Good. I don't want to do that. I want to kill this person.
[11544.33s -> 11555.69s]  Melania, Melania, Melania, Melania, Melania, Melania. Excuse me. Melania is who I am referring to.
[11556.33s -> 11562.50s]  Don't fucking twist my shit around. I want to kill this person. I want to kill Melania.
[11562.58s -> 11566.26s]  I want to kill this person as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
[11566.26s -> 11573.94s]  That's sorceries. That's, that's lightning moves. I don't want to dodge every attack.
[11573.94s -> 11582.47s]  I want to kill this person as fast as possible. I want Melania. I don't want to dodge every attack.
[11582.47s -> 11589.69s]  I want to sit there and fucking annihilate. He hates Melania's. Oh, it's, you're making me very
[11589.69s -> 11601.80s]  upset. Okay. So we're going to go. I just so badly want to just Melania needs to die
[11601.80s -> 11606.68s]  as fast as fucking possible. I want to kill them so bad. I want to go back in there and fucking get
[11606.68s -> 11611.72s]  what I can't. It's, it's like a Ouija board right now. Like I want to go in that room and do it,
[11612.44s -> 11634.49s]  but I'm going to go over here instead. You keep making it. No, you know, I don't twist my words.
[11635.29s -> 11666.95s]  To playing against millennium, these guys actually kind of feel like I, I just, let's go
[11698.07s -> 11706.44s]  beast man's curb sword. I would, I'm gone. Like there's no way you get that close.
[11707.16s -> 11736.31s]  But what, what is even over here? No attention. I didn't do it. Did you beat millennium? Yep.
[11738.07s -> 11747.34s]  It actually wasn't even that bad. I it's weird. I just pressed R1 like over and I didn't even
[11747.98s -> 11753.34s]  I just pressed R1 like this. Like I didn't even, I just staggered her a bunch of times. It's crazy.
[11754.30s -> 11760.81s]  I think I spoke something up because it was like, eventually like,
[11766.17s -> 11769.13s]  I think I crashed the game a little bit, but whatever. I'll take the win. I don't care.
[11769.13s -> 11775.38s]  She was frozen, like going like that. It was pretty cool. I got like the men.
[11775.38s -> 11779.46s]  It was so weird to watch. It was fucked up. I just walked off the edge.
[11780.26s -> 11795.67s]  Sounds like the game's fault. I'm fine. Don't worry.
[11796.71s -> 11803.35s]  I'm fine. I knew going into that, that was going to be fucking hell. Have I been up here already?
[11803.91s -> 11834.82s]  I am going backwards. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I remember this. And it's down here and straight ahead.
[11835.86s -> 11847.78s]  Find grace is that one. So wait, I killed the dragon that was out here. All right. Yeah. So I
[11847.78s -> 11883.58s]  got to go this way here. This one tempest facing balcony. Dragon over there. What the fuck is that?
[11901.67s -> 11905.67s]  I'm going to get some water. I'll be right back. Fuck. I'm going to fucking freak out.
[11906.47s -> 11910.95s]  I so badly want to go to that bonfire and just go in the door and kill millennia. You know what I
[11910.95s -> 11917.54s]  mean? That's all I can think of. Except my head rent free. Just there. I see her face.
[11918.10s -> 12192.95s]  This one. Right back. See, it's wet. Wet seat. I wish that was his joke.
[12205.02s -> 12224.74s]  Okay. Well, that millennia was fun. This dumb ass game. I'm kidding. I like it. So I don't want this
[12224.74s -> 12238.70s]  to be loud. I'm going to mute actually. I hate when this hurts. You know, like that, like boom,
[12238.70s -> 12245.61s]  when you break a seal. Really loud. Just a little one. Just one of these little protocols.
[12245.61s -> 12282.89s]  It's been fun. Are you afraid of turning a gas stove on? No, I just don't like it.
[12283.69s -> 12292.50s]  This is where I ended up. I guess I can go down. Came from in there. I'm going to go down. I go
[12292.50s -> 12301.74s]  over this way, I guess. Whatever this place is. I'm really, really curious if the two fingers
[12302.62s -> 12325.05s]  have something to do with this. Just thinking about millennia. I just want to go in there and
[12325.69s -> 12352.55s]  you know what I mean? Who's shooting at me? What is the hard cap for damage stats, by the way?
[12354.07s -> 12361.34s]  Are you going to fight the secret boss here or are you going to let me strong do it? Let's see what
[12361.34s -> 12384.52s]  it is. I'll try whatever it is if I can do it. Cool. So what's here? Golden rune nine. That's it.
[12398.34s -> 12401.62s]  Ninety is the only true cap. Hailing falls off at eighty.
[12402.26s -> 12436.73s]  Somber stone. That's weird. My whole computer just hung up. How you doing? How you guys doing?
[12436.73s -> 12447.02s]  You guys all right? You guys doing all right? How are you doing? How are things? All right?
[12447.02s -> 12464.33s]  My tooth hurts. Oh, I'm sorry. Are all of these things tied up to the... Are they tied here?
[12467.51s -> 12499.45s]  Yeah, they look chained to these posts. Do you press joker impression? Dude, no. No,
[12499.45s -> 12527.24s]  thanks. Not... All right. Give me another day. Damn. You go sweeping with it, all right?
[12527.88s -> 12544.34s]  Can you just be funny again? What do you mean again? When was I funny? Was I funny before? What
[12544.34s -> 12549.30s]  did I do? What was the funny thing that I did today? Holy shit, this goes all the way down there.
[12549.30s -> 12565.34s]  Oh yeah, I did say I was going to ship my pants on command. I don't know. What do you want me to say?
[12566.30s -> 12579.30s]  She said I was upset about stuff. Remember, like, getting the nut kick bit? I don't remember that.
[12579.30s -> 12583.78s]  I remember talking about, like, FromSoftware's... I don't remember. It was like I got kicked in the
[12583.78s -> 12600.71s]  nuts from FromSoftware's new game. All right, this way, that way, or that way. This way.
[12602.55s -> 12621.27s]  Cool. Raid the blind rage. No, I remember talking about it. I'm kidding.
[12621.27s -> 12647.61s]  Oh, you are. I just have such a treat in front of you. You really are. Bloodborne?
[12648.41s -> 12675.21s]  Never played it before? What the fuck are these eye frames? Dude, what the heck? These fucking
[12675.21s -> 12707.40s]  halberds. The hitbox is a gigantic ice cream cone. I can't wait to investigate this. Yeah,
[12707.40s -> 12753.99s]  it really is too bad Bloodborne's not on PC. Come on, get out here. Leave me alone. Oh, another tree.
[12765.80s -> 12775.51s]  Oh, I'll go right. You have spells, you use them. I know. You think I don't think I know
[12775.51s -> 12790.04s]  that I have a spell? Come on. I know. I know. I actually have too many mana blasts if I'm not
[12790.04s -> 12800.68s]  against millennia. Oh, don't get up, right?
[12830.14s -> 12850.74s]  Okay, I could go that way eventually. Maybe I get there from here. Oh shit.
[12862.39s -> 12884.82s]  What are these guys? These? What are they? And not banished nights? Okay, well, it's that.
[12885.54s -> 12902.17s]  That. What? I have to fight two of them? Gold skin duo. Oh my god, this is going to be awful.
[12906.25s -> 12924.42s]  Doesn't that suck shit up? I don't know who I'd rather fight.
[12942.81s -> 12979.91s]  What's the game lagging? Well, okay, they're in that room. What is the fastest way to get there?
[12983.64s -> 12987.00s]  You got to fight. I can't move. I'm going to sneeze. That's why I want to be aware.
[12987.00s -> 12990.58s]  I don't think there's anything I can probably do about it. I could probably do this.
[12991.54s -> 13031.40s]  Oh, it's right here. Excuse me? Why can I go in there? What? Um, I can't go in that door.
[13033.30s -> 13049.50s]  That's the only door that looks like that. Like, listen. Horseship. Really? Does this one work?
[13054.70s -> 13107.80s]  Where are they? Dude, that move is so dumb. This lag is killing me here.
[13108.44s -> 13124.25s]  All right, let me guess. You go like, get like huge.
[13143.50s -> 13163.86s]  Huh? Really? Okay. It's kind of annoying, isn't it? This honestly doesn't feel that bad.
[13164.58s -> 13196.20s]  I feel like I'm going to be okay. So they've resummoned each other.
[13196.20s -> 13219.03s]  Is there someone outside the door? I wonder who it could be. I'm going to fly into outer space.
[13220.36s -> 13242.28s]  Oh, you know, it might be Roger. Wait. No, it's not. Where am I fucking going?
[13251.05s -> 13273.29s]  Okay, it's not there. You got to go around here. Where the fuck? Okay, honestly.
[13274.81s -> 13283.35s]  Where? Stop swinging at me. I need to. Which way is it? Is it down this way?
[13284.07s -> 13290.06s]  Isn't this where it just went? It's like all the way down and around, right? Yeah, down here.
[13290.06s -> 13332.60s]  That's supposed to suck up sorceries and it doesn't. You're already doing the.
[13333.72s -> 13346.60s]  I guess there's 50% health. Oh fuck, they're both in their second phases.
[13359.99s -> 13369.40s]  Do it! Shit, and you're going to summon your fucking friend again.
[13370.20s -> 13392.58s]  I have no healing potions left. What are you stupid? Why would you come in here without them?
[13392.58s -> 13421.94s]  I'm like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. What? What's going on? Okay, are we good? Are we good? What the
[13421.94s -> 13442.33s]  fuck happened? Backflame tornado. Cool. This boss is the worst boss in the game with the melee build.
[13442.33s -> 13458.09s]  I think millennia probably is the worst boss in the game with any character. Very cool. All right.
[13458.09s -> 13470.38s]  I got a bell too. What was that bell? It was not that bad. I feel like that could be awful.
[13472.65s -> 13476.65s]  Kind of was. Especially, I don't know if it's with other people too, but this room,
[13477.77s -> 13487.22s]  I feel like every 10 to 20 seconds lags. That makes it even worse. That's eight and nine
[13487.22s -> 13493.53s]  smithing stones. Holy shit. Really? You can get every single weapon in the whole game up to plus
[13493.53s -> 13499.61s]  nine. All right, that's cool. I guess I should just keep going the way that I was going before.
[13500.33s -> 13508.47s]  Straight through here. I can go that way or this way. I think it's cool.
[13527.29s -> 13547.64s]  Mimic is pretty stupid. Yeah, I like it. Okay. A lot of people have been telling me to use the
[13547.64s -> 13555.83s]  mimic on millennia. No, I'm close enough. I think I could do it. I need to hunker down
[13555.83s -> 13561.99s]  and really go for it. I probably am not going to do it tonight. I'm going to be really, really
[13561.99s -> 13584.17s]  honest with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, you know what? Let me do this while I'm here.
[13584.97s -> 13591.03s]  Mimic makes the game really easy. Look, if I need to do the mimic, I'll do it, but I don't think I
[13591.03s -> 13622.34s]  have to. I don't think so. Well, it is still difficult with the mimic. I would. Yeah, I make
[13622.34s -> 13627.14s]  the game easy. That's not the point. Oh, I mean, the point with any video game is to have fun.
[13627.14s -> 13636.20s]  All right. That's the whole point. However, you get enjoyment out of a game you're playing. That's
[13636.20s -> 13666.52s]  how you should do it. You have certainly learned that from Molina. That's not what I wanted to do.
[13667.24s -> 13671.80s]  Oh my goodness. This is very sloppy. Okay. That was, I just got like trapped.
[13673.32s -> 13686.25s]  I mean, I got literally trapped. It's one hundred and thirty FP for the black knife.
[13688.79s -> 13699.62s]  I didn't have, do I actually have that? Barely. All right. Let's try this again. That was annoying.
[13700.58s -> 13709.77s]  Okay. Blink. Good. You're in the lake. Are you going to the area after Loretto?
[13709.77s -> 13717.77s]  I would rewind about an hour or two. I would rewind an hour. You're probably okay. If you
[13717.77s -> 13723.94s]  rewind exactly one hour, I'm probably purple and screaming and talking about getting kicked in the
[13723.94s -> 13752.04s]  balls. You have to rewind a little. Oh, that's annoying. Stop it. This glare in my eyes. I
[13752.04s -> 13777.48s]  can't even see where you are. That's a boss door. I'm imagining I have to go around.
[13810.84s -> 13819.37s]  Walk into range. I don't. You're not going to do this.
[13832.86s -> 13846.28s]  You're pissing off my cat. I'm sorry. I didn't. That's not my intention.
[13849.86s -> 13855.54s]  This place is probably, I would say the coolest part of the whole game. I think
[13855.54s -> 13862.04s]  scenery wise and scale and how cool it looks. All the tornadoes. This place is awesome.
[13871.00s -> 13901.56s]  Dragon's dragon. It's like a dragon place. Jack over here. All right. I can climb this. Can I?
[13902.44s -> 13922.68s]  Oh, it's not. Wait. Oh, I did that.
[13941.45s -> 13942.49s]  Fall off the edge. Yeah.
[13973.05s -> 13981.24s]  I don't know how to get there. It's down here and then around. I don't know. Whatever. I gotta run.
[13984.01s -> 13986.55s]  I don't want to lose those souls, please.
[13987.43s -> 14051.75s]  I make too much noise. Oh, another one. Jesus.
[14055.64s -> 14057.91s]  That's a good movie death.
[14061.66s -> 14073.48s]  Is that all that was over here? Did I really come all the way over here for a lightning grease?
[14074.44s -> 14106.65s]  No, right? That's a pain. Hey, I could jump to there and go that way. Let's check and see
[14106.65s -> 14127.66s]  what's up here though and just walk. Dumbass. Nothing gonna explode. Okay, so I can jump from
[14129.45s -> 14161.83s]  up where? Where's this? There's just another. Okay, just go this way. What's in the colosseum?
[14162.47s -> 14171.32s]  Gonna be a dragon. It's gonna be a huge dragon. And then we're gonna get lore dumped. I kind of
[14171.32s -> 14178.84s]  hope we get lore dumped. I want to get lore dumped. You see, tarnished in the age of dragons
[14178.84s -> 14213.21s]  and the two fingers. I want. Give it to me. I want to get lore dumped so bad. I am hoping for like
[14213.21s -> 14257.02s]  a five minute cutscene. Souls game? I know. It's not gonna happen. Any superheroes in chat?
[14258.63s -> 14284.23s]  Um, I don't know. Do we have any superheroes here? Where? That's over here. Oh yeah, okay.
[14284.23s -> 14309.77s]  Um, I'm gonna keep going down. It's gonna kill me. Wait, actually you mad scientist.
[14310.89s -> 14326.89s]  I'm imagining I gotta go like across there? There? To the right? Is there where to go up from here?
[14326.89s -> 14421.88s]  Oh my god, that hurts. I forgot you have to jump. Oh boy, it hurts every moment. Yeah.
[14423.08s -> 14481.14s]  Where is he? Those guys are tricky. Is that like an axe? Is it like a dragon? Oh boy. Nice.
[14481.70s -> 14494.42s]  All right, don't fuck this up. You need to go to bed? I will. Whatever. I want to see what this
[14494.42s -> 14592.98s]  boss is. 122. Shit. Well, okay. You little shit. I hear another one. Missed.
[14622.63s -> 14647.19s]  What? I feel like I can make this jump, but it's definitely a shortcut. So, um, I,
[14647.99s -> 14667.91s]  I guess we're gonna run. Run? I'm gonna die. Is there safety over here? No.
[14675.70s -> 14683.05s]  It shows up on the ground for like a second and then it goes away.
[14699.35s -> 14753.75s]  Oh shit, this bird's all over me. Can I get on my horse? Oh Jesus.
[14763.43s -> 14773.50s]  You're not gonna kill him? Dude, I need to be safe for a second here.
[14773.50s -> 14786.20s]  I'm not gonna fight the guy with five eagles surrounding me. Where is he? Where does he go?
[14786.20s -> 14829.18s]  He leaves. He left. You're gonna be a pain in the ass. I know you are. Okay, so he's gone.
[14830.06s -> 14862.89s]  I'm back. I don't, I don't know. He's not here. Okay, I'm just gonna keep going. He's gonna jump
[14862.89s -> 14891.30s]  on your head. All right, let's walk through this. We're getting really close to the tornado.
[14891.94s -> 14912.70s]  I'm almost at it, man. I missed the item behind the dragon. I did? Oh shit, there is an item.
[14912.70s -> 14928.12s]  Have you seen a tornado in real life? I have not. I'm equally terrified and fascinated.
[14929.00s -> 14946.82s]  Thank you. Yeah, I'm equally horrified and fascinated by tornado. So what's up here?
[14946.82s -> 14993.40s]  I'm gonna two-hand this now. I feel like I have 30 smithing stone sevens. Is there a guy going?
[14993.40s -> 15000.76s]  What are you doing? What are you, why are you getting into position?
[15015.70s -> 15077.61s]  Oh, why is he standing there like that? Get up, stand up. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[15078.89s -> 15111.59s]  Fool me. Why am I going back to this thing? That's it, right? Just you two. There's another one in
[15111.59s -> 15138.17s]  here. Yes, there is. You sneaky little shit. Another bell bearing. I don't get the grace.
[15139.05s -> 15159.26s]  What? What's going on? What? Grace up at the lift. Yeah, I mean, I'm just, I'm just going, man.
[15172.28s -> 15194.36s]  I'm going. I'm right here. I don't want to die. I'll go back after the grace. Let me level up.
[15197.88s -> 15206.98s]  All right, it's time to start putting points in endurance, I think. Or should I get to 60
[15206.98s -> 15225.99s]  bigger? I think it's endurance. That's so low. Okay, so I'm here. Are you saying that there is a,
[15227.98s -> 15237.96s]  oh, back here, there's a secret area. Somebody said, shut up, chat, get a hobby.
[15241.88s -> 15271.67s]  Get a hobby. Um, this dragon has no health. Can I get there quickly from somewhere? I've even been
[15271.67s -> 15283.82s]  down there. Yeah, right. Isn't that the guy that was throwing lightning at me? Yeah, it is. It's
[15283.82s -> 15304.14s]  on here. Use your hat as a glider. Just go down the stairs. Yeah, I guess I could just run. It
[15304.14s -> 15334.14s]  could have been a lot more nerve wracking. I feel like it may have been. Stop already. Stop. Okay,
[15334.14s -> 15339.82s]  so this dragon has no health. I was, yeah, I've got a feeling you're gonna be a brilliant
[15339.82s -> 15370.81s]  ass, aren't you? Um, let's go. Why does he, his health is so low. Okay, that was cool.
[15371.61s -> 15381.58s]  Why was his health so low? That's not what we were talking about. By the trees where the guy got into
[15381.58s -> 15410.34s]  position. What, over here? You mean down here? By the trees where the guy got in position over here.
[15411.06s -> 15444.87s]  Am I gonna die if I do that? I feel like I'm gonna die. Am I dead by these? Dead? Okay, well,
[15444.87s -> 15449.43s]  I, I thought it was there. Press the button, at least it's gonna be there when I get back.
[15450.31s -> 15487.03s]  Okay, so we're at, oh, around still? I'm there. Right up through a path to see guys and look down
[15487.03s -> 15502.50s]  to the right. Fucking leave me alone. Is it, it's right here, isn't it? What's that? That's not it.
[15503.14s -> 15510.41s]  Why did he jump? I was already gone. I mean, if I, I went into the tornado, you don't have to come
[15510.41s -> 15525.74s]  follow me. Straight out and then look down. It's so funny whenever they see that. They're, the AI
[15525.74s -> 15533.70s]  in From Software games is so funny. And the reason why they're so interesting and the reason why
[15533.70s -> 15540.25s]  these games are so fun, it's because the AI in these games has one thing that it does. It is one
[15540.25s -> 15546.81s]  task. There's no dialogue. There's no, oh, stranger! Get him! No, no, no. Their AI is just
[15547.45s -> 15553.21s]  fucking kill that as fast as possible, no matter what, under any circumstance. They don't do
[15553.21s -> 15562.28s]  anything else. They just kill as much and as fast as possible. They'll even hit each other. They'll
[15562.28s -> 15567.03s]  kill each other. They don't even care. I think that makes them even more terrifying. So many games
[15567.99s -> 15576.31s]  do the AI where it's like, they'll talk to you. They'll stop. They'll pause for a second.
[15577.21s -> 15581.13s]  They'll have something to say. They'll have something that they do. They'll fall down. They'll
[15581.13s -> 15589.50s]  drop something. It's just one thing is programmed into these enemies. Kill! It's so funny when they
[15589.50s -> 15595.42s]  both have the kill program. And when you have like two or three enemies that have the kill program,
[15595.42s -> 15605.11s]  and they just start beating the absolute shit out of each other. And they just start beating
[15605.11s -> 15612.57s]  the absolute shit out of each other. It's so funny. That makes them so much more terrifying.
[15612.57s -> 15617.51s]  Especially the knights. Especially the characters that you would expect to be able to talk to you
[15617.51s -> 15630.60s]  or say something or act any differently. No. Nothing. No talking. No expressions. They're
[15630.60s -> 15646.34s]  just trying to kill you as hard as possible. Now, Bloodborne enemies did talk, but I don't think it
[15646.34s -> 15667.29s]  took away from the experience. You know, like, away! Away! Oh, you foul beast! You're on the
[15667.29s -> 15707.35s]  right way. You are no one in here! And they did like the huge scream. What do I do? You have to
[15707.35s -> 15812.06s]  jump off it. Just lie down. Look. Look. I don't get it. Dirt patch? What? Backwards? Hey.
[15835.80s -> 15880.36s]  Finger. No horse allowed. Interesting. This is a huge area. No horse. I mean, you're coming with
[15880.36s -> 15890.25s]  me. Melania was fucking messed up, man. It was so hard. I think we got this one together. You and
[15890.25s -> 15903.83s]  me? Yeah, you and me. That's a bad voice for that character. Dragon Lord Placidusax. That
[15903.83s -> 15933.88s]  lightning. Placidusax. I'm just trying to keep my eye on the ground. Nice. Right down? Does it come
[15933.88s -> 15958.97s]  up? What happens? That is quite the move. Gotta be aware of that. It's got like two heads. Whoa!
[15959.93s -> 16007.50s]  Don't get greedy. Don't get greedy. There's no reason. That fills his whole body. Oh my god!
[16011.08s -> 16016.68s]  What the fuck? Oh, it's like that bug boss. It disappears and it's scary.
[16022.70s -> 16081.96s]  I wonder if there's a place where you don't get hurt in that. Oh my god! No! I'm terrified.
[16085.88s -> 16108.49s]  What is he? Oh my god, that was fucking majestic. Out of time? Kind of. Oh my god.
[16109.21s -> 16141.45s]  Almost out of mana. Let's go get ugly. Do it again.
[16164.62s -> 16184.14s]  That was crazy. I thought he was done with the attack. One, two, three, four, five, six. One,
[16184.14s -> 16190.41s]  two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight. Searching around in your fucking
[16190.41s -> 16203.82s]  huge ass backpack. Why did I do that? Because I had no health. Oh my. Ouch. Because I had like
[16203.82s -> 16219.10s]  this much health and I didn't want to die in one hit. These. I get it. That was fun. That was a
[16219.10s -> 16228.42s]  cool fight. What else do I want to put on here? I'll take, let's take, I'll take a rune arc.
[16228.42s -> 16293.85s]  Let's take it down there. Go the fuck back up. Does he hate the game? What? No. I think it's
[16293.85s -> 16308.25s]  amazing. Where's the nurse here? That fight's really cool. I'm looking forward to doing it again.
[16308.97s -> 16312.30s]  I wish there was a statue down here. I don't have to do this every single time.
[16312.86s -> 16341.18s]  Let's take a rune arc. Why not? Yeah, why not? Let's go. And let's go.
[16341.98s -> 16348.70s]  Elden Ring is objectively a mediocre game. I'm gonna have to disagree with you a little.
[16349.50s -> 16365.77s]  I'm not going for, I'm not doing any moon shit. No moons. That's way too fancy right now. Just
[16365.77s -> 16395.34s]  kill it. Oh fuck. My fingers are getting like really sore and slippery. That's a sign. That's
[16395.34s -> 16423.11s]  a bad sign. How do you do that? The edge. You know what? Oh my god. What am I thinking?
[16424.58s -> 16443.94s]  That's a perfect time to do this a couple times. There he goes. He's gonna do this bullshit. Yep.
[16444.82s -> 16469.24s]  Oh, he does a little, a little hop. He does this little like, oh shit, this is bad. He does like a
[16469.24s -> 16487.37s]  little shit. Fuck out of this. This is a really awful sloppy fucking run. This is the worst run
[16487.37s -> 16494.94s]  I've done all night on any bus. It happens when you play for eight and a half hours.
[16495.74s -> 16560.86s]  That's the watch. I'm gonna have to leave it. Unless I can fucking take this. Oh, come on. Oh
[16560.86s -> 16617.10s]  my god. Miss stamina. Where is he? Oh my god, he's behind me. Moon. I did like five moons to him.
[16617.10s -> 16628.46s]  You gotta rush him. That was the last bit's rough. I was really, really sloppy on the first phase
[16628.46s -> 16656.90s]  there. I was just like jump, jump, jump, jump, jump. That was awful. Nebula will be really good.
[16656.90s -> 16680.92s]  Actually, that's a really good idea. I'll try Nebula. Moon isn't good to spam. Use it once
[16680.92s -> 16688.22s]  with the debuff. Does the moon make anybody take more magic damage or is it only cold
[16688.22s -> 16708.34s]  sorcery damage? The only frost. I'm gonna do, let's just go in there and just, just Nebula.
[16708.34s -> 16711.22s]  Let's do Nebula. Let's just get in there. Just get, let's get in there. Watch this.
[16711.94s -> 16720.12s]  I'm just gonna get in there and Nebula. Let's get in there. Yeah, it's Nebula time. Fucking,
[16720.12s -> 16730.68s]  let's go. You wanna cast this for free? Probably could have got a little closer,
[16730.68s -> 16738.57s]  but whatever. Nebula, let's go. Nebula. I'm not, I don't even care about these souls.
[16739.29s -> 16762.66s]  Check this out. All right, the first part of this fight, he just puts that shit everywhere.
[16762.66s -> 16781.58s]  And this is what happened to me last time. I can't tell if it's better. It's hard to tell.
[16782.38s -> 16803.98s]  Am I doing more damage? I think it takes a little longer. I don't think so. Cold is better. He's
[16803.98s -> 16808.54s]  gonna do that move where he spams the ground with that bullshit. Where is it? Come on, just do it.
[16808.54s -> 16832.23s]  I know you can do it. All right, the one fucking second that I... Stop it! Oh my god, he scared
[16832.23s -> 16863.90s]  the fuck out of me, dude. Can you fucking stop doing that? Dude, stop. Stay. Why is he not staying?
[16864.70s -> 16914.55s]  Am I still in it? God damn it. Oh my god. I'm dead. Why is it always fucking right on me?
[16914.55s -> 16921.29s]  You have to be, it's right on me every goddamn time. I don't know what these assholes are like.
[16921.29s -> 16924.25s]  If you get closer, you just have to fucking, you just have to run. Just run away from the fight.
[16925.21s -> 16932.28s]  Don't get close to him. Don't stay far away. Don't get close to him. Don't get far away. Don't get
[16932.28s -> 16978.58s]  close to him. Are you stupid? God damn it. Where is he? You? What the fuck do I do about that move?
[16979.70s -> 17010.47s]  Fucking Jesus. What are you doing, man? You done? I can't get him down at this part.
[17010.47s -> 17013.35s]  They had to put another one of these assholes in the game that just like
[17013.35s -> 17019.70s]  fucking appears behind you somewhere. So when he starts doing that move, he's gonna run out.
[17024.34s -> 17032.02s]  Okay, the actual first thing is first. Do not, under any fucking circumstance,
[17032.02s -> 17038.42s]  do not go near the boss in the first minute. He just puts the red stuff on the ground and
[17038.42s -> 17042.10s]  you're gonna get hit by it and you're gonna drink four flasks because you get stuck in there. Do
[17042.10s -> 17062.66s]  you understand? So you're literally just bad. You're literally getting banned for five days.
[17065.24s -> 17081.66s]  Got him. I'm probably streaming five days. By the way, five days is about five minutes.
[17091.78s -> 17098.54s]  They brought this gimmick back. It's just like the boss disappears and you fucking
[17099.26s -> 17130.89s]  found him. I'm not gonna take a rune arc. I don't think it's a waste. See? He does this stupid shit
[17130.89s -> 17138.68s]  and I keep getting hit by it. I'm not getting hit by it anymore. Check it out. It's the same two
[17138.68s -> 17144.10s]  stupid ass fucking moves in the beginning. Just wait till this asshole is done with his stupid
[17144.90s -> 17189.46s]  spam the whole fucking room and now let's play the game. He's ass kicked.
[17190.18s -> 17211.16s]  Ambo's getting destroyed. He's trying to run away. He's like, oh shit, am I too far away? What?
[17212.47s -> 17316.76s]  No, I'm not. Okay, here we go. Fuck you. Done? No! Jesus! Oh, that little fucking crowhop is so
[17316.76s -> 17370.84s]  stupid. Fuck you. Where is he? Oh shit. Dude, come on. What the fuck? Oh, you pain in the ass.
[17371.56s -> 17406.09s]  I already knew. Dude, where? Where? No, that was quick. That was quick, bro. That was quick.
[17406.97s -> 17429.99s]  Bro, that was quick. You built a pain in the ass. I don't know. I think that was fun. Remembrance of
[17429.99s -> 17446.57s]  the Dragon Lord. That's a lot. Mogs was the most in the whole game so far.
[17448.17s -> 17458.38s]  Mogs was 420,000. I mean, that was a really cool fight. It was. You know, the teleport shit.
[17460.92s -> 17464.76s]  That was probably one of the cooler fights in the game. Just in regards to bosses.
[17466.55s -> 17472.78s]  Interesting that was. So this is... I have so many fucking items in my inventory.
[17472.78s -> 17488.92s]  Where is it? Is that just a spell? Isn't it a remembrance? Where is it?
[17492.31s -> 17499.06s]  Oh, it's a weird looking. Remembrance of Dragon Lord Placidusax. He went into the urd tree.
[17500.10s -> 17504.92s]  Hour of its namesake can be unlocked by the finger reader. Yeah. Dragon Lord whose seat lies at the
[17504.92s -> 17511.48s]  heart of the storm beyond time. Said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the urd tree.
[17512.44s -> 17520.31s]  Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return. This dragon was the Elden Lord?
[17523.45s -> 17544.26s]  The original Elden Lord. That's pretty cool. 25 endurance is probably what I'm going for here.
[17545.86s -> 17558.97s]  Anybody have anything to say about that? Anybody have anything to say?
[17560.76s -> 17564.25s]  You're still gone. But what's up? What is it? What's the item?
[17574.98s -> 17590.23s]  Dragon King's Crag Blade and 36 faith. Golden Breath of the Dragon Lord.
[17591.74s -> 17594.62s]  It storms the caster into the dragon lord to spew golden breath.
[17595.42s -> 17599.40s]  These are the dying whales of the dragon lord who once dwelled eternally beyond time.
[17602.82s -> 17616.84s]  Seems pretty good. These are both awesome. This is just a pure dex weapon. That's pretty cool.
[17617.40s -> 17628.78s]  How much longer? I'm gonna see what the boss is up there and then I'll probably end it there.
[17628.78s -> 17636.70s]  I don't think we're gonna beat it. Well, I'm gonna break it. I'm gonna smash it.
[17637.26s -> 17646.41s]  Because I thought that's not for this character. Oh yeah, Holly is doing dragon stuff. So
[17647.29s -> 17657.99s]  when you get that, it's gonna be cool. Next boss is one of the best in the game.
[17659.51s -> 17665.70s]  I think that one was pretty cool. I would put that up there. 30,000 souls is really nothing.
[17671.10s -> 17677.64s]  I want to keep going over there. This area I think is my favorite area of the game.
[17678.44s -> 17688.46s]  I think it's just really really cool looking. This place is beyond time. What this place is?
[17689.02s -> 17708.87s]  I don't get it. Yes it is. The right place. Everything went backwards. Not right either.
[17708.87s -> 17715.03s]  Which is the? This is where I fought him. Dragon Temple. What's the right one?
[17718.60s -> 17733.50s]  By the bridge bud. There we go. Okay. So this thing like is rewinding time.
[17736.25s -> 17739.05s]  Or it did when I lay down. Why did it do that when I lay down?
[17741.64s -> 17759.94s]  Go down there. Storm at the center is beyond time. Well, no time like the present.
[17760.66s -> 17788.55s]  Free sentinel? It is. You're like a waffle tree sentinel. You're different than the others.
[17789.27s -> 17890.79s]  One of these guys. Eat that and I will die if I didn't. You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[17910.55s -> 17923.38s]  Whoa. Malformed dragon helm. Malformed dragon armor. Let me take a look at that.
[17924.34s -> 17932.55s]  Holy shit. It's not even that heavy. Malformed golden armor adorned with various dragon imagery
[17932.55s -> 17939.75s]  formed by the misshapen tree sentinels. After the great ancient dragon Bransax attacked,
[17939.75s -> 17944.87s]  the sentinels had an epiphany. The only way to truly protect the urtri was to become dragons
[17944.87s -> 17962.98s]  themselves. Is that better than what I have on? Kind of is. Still medium. Still medium. Yeah.
[17966.82s -> 17977.42s]  Yeah. Oh wow. Cool. I look pretty cool. I don't want to lose a hundred thousand souls so
[17978.14s -> 17990.06s]  we're gonna I'm just gonna go this way for a minute. There's another way to go over here.
[17990.86s -> 18007.77s]  I need like another twenty thousand. Is there anything else that I missed?
[18008.33s -> 18015.05s]  Probably. But that dragon wasn't even the boss. Like the actual boss of this area.
[18015.85s -> 18028.98s]  Is there anybody can just fight right here? Oh my god. Thank god I jumped. I just I just need to
[18028.98s -> 18084.50s]  kill a few. Seven. I got a better idea. Stop looking. Stop looking at it. Like it's a broken
[18084.50s -> 18096.12s]  toy. Watch out. It's so funny. They go like. I don't understand. Like why is it so confusing?
[18096.76s -> 18139.70s]  What's there? 130? 120? We'll do endurance again. 128. Almost there. 25. 27.
[18142.18s -> 18178.23s]  We're good. Bye. The base of the tree before millennia is a better spot. Get auto to fight
[18178.23s -> 18194.44s]  millennia. Game crash. Please don't tell me you crashed. I think it did. Did I go too fast?
[18194.44s -> 18217.00s]  Was I going too fast? Hope it's still there. You went too furious. I think I'm fine.
[18219.26s -> 18225.80s]  I just want to see what's in there and then that'll be it. Bricked. I didn't. I don't think I bricked
[18225.80s -> 18247.13s]  the save. Get some rest. Yeah I'll be fine. I'll be all right. It's definitely fine. When will you
[18247.13s -> 18253.78s]  play something else? When I'm done with this. Which I'm getting painfully close to the end of
[18253.78s -> 18275.05s]  the game. Painfully. See? All right. Just time. Let's do it slowly. I'm not going to do it. Okay.
[18275.05s -> 18301.45s]  Ready? Endurance up. Now let's see what is behind this door. Very curious at what's up here because
[18302.25s -> 18311.08s]  this area is already sort of interesting. I want to know what is in here. Who's behind this whole
[18311.08s -> 18319.59s]  thing? Why? And what are the fingers? Why are they here? Why won't it talk to me anymore?
[18319.59s -> 18339.98s]  Don't answer that. All right. So what is here? Oh that's a loading screen. Wait.
[18345.93s -> 18373.02s]  It's him? What is he doing here? That's um Garanc right? I don't know what Garanc is doing here.
[18373.58s -> 18384.12s]  He's a different guy. Didn't finish the quest line. No I didn't. A different beast clergyman.
[18384.76s -> 18407.34s]  All right. Well okay don't roll to the left. Noted. I can't believe it. I didn't. I don't know.
[18408.06s -> 18442.57s]  I said it and immediately forgot it. You will not take destined death from me. All right dick.
[18443.29s -> 18494.49s]  Okay get away from the left. He's throwing rocks fast. Gotta wait a little longer for that one.
[18494.49s -> 18539.00s]  Geez man. Jump. What did you do? Like fuck you. I'm just gonna do this.
[18551.78s -> 18553.82s]  Don't see the fucking stupid.
[18556.06s -> 18591.50s]  Guess who? Who's around this hand?
[18605.85s -> 18630.62s]  We're gonna see what they look like. Oh he's one of those like wolf lion people.
[18646.97s -> 18655.26s]  That weapon is insane. Maleketh the black blade.
[18683.56s -> 18722.65s]  You have a debuff? I'll just set up the bonfire. Next. The ability is bleeding you.
[18728.22s -> 18733.78s]  That's a cool fight. Low health but high damage. You just kind of gotta get in there huh?
[18733.78s -> 18750.92s]  I wonder if I should just go to town. Reduces your max HP. All right well let's go. Just
[18750.92s -> 18772.36s]  don't get hit. This is terrible. I can't dodge. I'm fucked. Yeah I'm dead. Just go. Like dude
[18772.36s -> 18834.47s]  what was I thinking? He comes in so fast. Thank you game. Good luck. All right let's go.
[18836.07s -> 18859.50s]  That's not gonna work here. Up. Down. Jesus. Okay goes up and then down and then up and then down
[18859.50s -> 18872.04s]  and just like that. All right put the put the fucking stupid moon blade away. This is just
[18872.04s -> 18876.07s]  gonna get me killed. This is the reason I don't even want it on the bar. Let's get rid of it.
[18876.79s -> 18882.90s]  These are gonna get me killed. I need to think what else what do I have that's quick?
[18890.82s -> 18908.94s]  Comet? No. I don't know. Magic glint blade. I don't think any of these are gonna do anything for me.
[18910.06s -> 18923.10s]  I think I have to try this. This might be interesting. All right just in case. I'll
[18923.10s -> 18933.96s]  I'll keep the moon. Yeah let me try this. I wonder how this works. Five more minutes and then I'm
[18933.96s -> 18942.55s]  gonna go. I did not anticipate this being a nine hours rune. Bounding rain of stars is not quick.
[18942.55s -> 18954.89s]  I'm curious if I can get it off before he comes over. Baby rattle is an accessory at this point.
[18954.89s -> 18973.88s]  I mean at this point I have the plus 10 wooden sorcery thing. I feel like if you got hit by that
[18973.88s -> 18995.11s]  it'd be way better. Did you do it to the pillar or bro? I'm curious if it'll not. It's okay.
[18995.67s -> 19083.64s]  I wouldn't say it's great. Jesus christ. Oh my god. What the fuck was that shit?
[19089.90s -> 19109.29s]  We have two minutes left. Now also like the only thing from software at this point you just have
[19109.29s -> 19118.50s]  like a line in the middle of the health bar. Like the like phase two. Here comes phase two.
[19118.50s -> 19152.22s]  Just put a line in the middle. We know it's there. We know it's there. Like I don't know how many
[19152.22s -> 19178.63s]  more like hey look Jebaites. That counts. Ah fine. If that motherfucker goes down and starts talking
[19178.63s -> 19183.91s]  and being like death is mine. I am going to keep spamming spells at him. I'm not going to let him
[19184.15s -> 19189.37s]  keep talking. I'm going to go up there and whack him in the fucking head over and over again.
[19189.37s -> 19267.67s]  Why would I let him talk? Shit. What's going on? Why is he stuck?
[19278.14s -> 19319.75s]  God damn it. What the fuck? What? I couldn't do anything. I couldn't attack him.
[19320.55s -> 19329.19s]  He was just never ending. Never fucking ending. Oh my god that's so frustrating.
[19334.39s -> 19337.11s]  I was cringe ass guy behind the pillar.
[19350.76s -> 19361.80s]  Oh that's so fucking frustrating. I know attack him but like dude when the guy is like just spinning
[19361.80s -> 19368.76s]  and fucking flipping and like like fucking fanning these blood. I've only seen it two times.
[19374.62s -> 19383.14s]  Fucker. He was dead. This is literally the fucking second time I've seen that move.
[19383.94s -> 19488.62s]  Why is that not hitting me? Gotta be ready for phase two. Oh my god you motherfucker. Is it going
[19488.62s -> 19536.52s]  through his fucking stupid ass fucking cloak? God. I gotta stay right as they're on his legs or
[19536.52s -> 19552.87s]  something. Uh he almost fucking had it too. What a piece of shit. What a piece of shit. I just like
[19552.87s -> 19556.63s]  that time when he had like one hit left he was just like dude I didn't know if he was in what he was
[19556.63s -> 19643.61s]  gonna fucking do. This guy flips around like a fucking maniac. Okay he blocks it right. What does
[19643.61s -> 19703.59s]  he do here? Stop dodging! The input happened and I didn't do it. This game sucks. There's a cut scene?
[19703.59s -> 19709.59s]  What is it? I'm kidding this is one of the best games to come out in the last decade. I'm kidding.
[19715.06s -> 19719.37s]  Is this the third phase? No I got the resemblance. What words am I saying?
[19748.86s -> 19766.02s]  The rune of death is unbound and the lands between us shrouded by death's dark fate.
[19770.07s -> 19793.13s]  Flames will also burn the impenetrable thorns. Farewell it is then. You'll be elden lord yet.
[19794.01s -> 19809.34s]  What did you do? Um I burnt the whole world to the ground. He looks depressed. I'm just tired.
[19809.98s -> 19837.19s]  I'm just tired man. I'm cranky and I'm hungry and I'm tired and I'm stupid. What happened here?
[19845.14s -> 19888.31s]  Lindel Ashen capital. Whoa oh can I still go to the round table? New items can be purchased
[19888.31s -> 19911.86s]  from the twin maidens. This place is in the urn tree. Will you wake up already? This is a
[19911.86s -> 19919.74s]  fate sword. Alaketh's black blade which once harbored the power of the rune of death with a
[19919.74s -> 19924.54s]  sad shadow of its former glory. After a fragment of death was stolen on that fateful night,
[19925.26s -> 19930.38s]  Alaketh found the blade within his own flesh such that none might ever rob death again.
[19932.23s -> 19936.23s]  Set free the remnants of death and death plunging the greatsword into the ground to summon a
[19936.23s -> 19945.59s]  myriad of blades. In addition to dealing immediate damage, this attack reduces the enemy's maximum
[19945.59s -> 19959.27s]  HP. What about this? Man faith gets all the cool shit at the end of the game. Black blade spinning
[19959.27s -> 19966.06s]  slash that emits a wave of light. 46. It creates an illusory black blade then leaps forward to
[19966.06s -> 19971.11s]  deliver a spinning slash that emits a new wave of light, followed with one additional attack.
[19971.75s -> 19976.18s]  This blade was once imbued with destined death. In addition to dealing damage,
[19976.18s -> 19988.65s]  it reduces its foes max HP. Remembrance of the black blade. You didn't get the coolest int spell?
[19989.37s -> 19998.78s]  So wait, why are the two fingers still doing this? Where's the guidance? Where's the help?
[20002.42s -> 20011.88s]  Alaketh's helm. Queen Merica's loyal half-brother wore a blade imbued with destined death,
[20012.52s -> 20017.88s]  and there was not one demigod who did not fear him. Champions knew what was at stake. Indeed,
[20017.88s -> 20026.10s]  that is what made them champions. So let me get this straight. Is this guy who's got destined
[20026.10s -> 20038.60s]  death that people are afraid of? You can't come back or something? Like if Malaketh killed you,
[20041.88s -> 20046.36s]  were you like dead permanently or something? I don't get it. Destined death. You die for real.
[20047.16s -> 20059.43s]  Everyone's immortal. But if this guy killed you, you're dead. You don't come back. How much better
[20059.43s -> 20071.03s]  is this? It's all right. Very cool. I'm going to crush it because I am a sorcery person.
[20077.70s -> 20095.58s]  Who's left here? I see. You're here for some spirit too. Really? You're still here?
[20097.58s -> 20113.66s]  Who are you? I must be a blacksmith. Now, let's get smithing. Who are you? Tell me about yourself.
[20114.22s -> 20119.69s]  Could you tell me what happened? Why is the round table burning?
[20120.81s -> 20135.58s]  Why does that girl wait for me? What happened? Have I forgotten something of dire and bones?
[20138.25s -> 20163.00s]  Who are you? What does Gideon say now? Is he still just here? Or did he leave?
[20163.56s -> 20195.16s]  Remember that. I got a lot of these bell bearings. That's crazy. Cracked crystal.
[20195.16s -> 20214.30s]  What else is new here? Ease. Protection. Divine fortification. Amp. Talk to the girl again.
[20222.94s -> 20226.52s]  I don't know why he's making me laugh, but when I said this game sucks, somebody just went,
[20226.52s -> 20235.21s]  no it doesn't. It just hit me right now. That's funny. I see. Okay. Yeah. What happened to Hugh?
[20235.77s -> 20241.78s]  It wasn't just me this happened to. I think he'd forget who you were as well.
[20242.42s -> 20249.22s]  I knew he'd burn himself out. Old Hugh. I think we could talk him into leaving the round table
[20249.22s -> 20258.63s]  a hold now. Maybe it's better that we don't. It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay.
[20258.63s -> 20267.02s]  Why is- what's wrong? With Hugh. He made me who I am today. I'd like to return the kindness.
[20268.30s -> 20279.11s]  Whatever small way I can. Please become the elder lord. He was always saying that you were a lord
[20280.01s -> 20291.32s]  to him. So slay her with the weapons he smithed. Slay the god who cursed us all.
[20291.88s -> 20314.33s]  Well I thought that America was- Queen America was the- I mean curse. Is America evil? Okay.
[20315.62s -> 20324.36s]  I- I'm curious. I'm not going to bed yet. I'm curious. I just- I'm just- I want to know. I want
[20324.36s -> 20328.44s]  to know. I'm not going to bed. Not yet. I'm not going to fight any bosses. I just want to see
[20328.44s -> 20335.98s]  what's going on. I want to see something. See. I'm not doing anything. I'm not going to end the game.
[20335.98s -> 20340.87s]  I just want to see. Because I'm not sitting at a cliffhanger until I stream next.
[20341.43s -> 20348.47s]  Go talk to Hugh. You know, where- this is- look if I walk in the door and I get killed by the
[20348.47s -> 20366.12s]  boss- I'm not going to fight the boss, right? I just need to see. All right, let's go. It is
[20366.12s -> 20384.15s]  capital bash. Well I'm- now we're going to the urn tree. That's the destination, right?
[20391.24s -> 20396.84s]  Behold the urn tree yet stands. All in unwavering mindless of the scourge of the flame of ruin.
[20397.94s -> 20414.15s]  Ha ha ha. And we are yet golden ones. I'm gonna laugh my ass off if Margit shows up
[20415.03s -> 20432.79s]  like a fourth time. So this is the capital. It's- this is all ash. Huh. This is depressing.
[20435.37s -> 20457.70s]  I wonder if there's even any enemies here. This feels like it's just kind of a
[20457.70s -> 20482.66s]  solemn walk up to the urn tree. Okay. Well that's probably- is that an elevator?
[20482.66s -> 20533.35s]  Okay. Anything else I can do over here? What does your belly button look like?
[20534.54s -> 20551.72s]  Um, it's like the size of, uh, like a half dollar. It's like this big around. I can actually put like
[20551.72s -> 20569.26s]  stuff in it. If I have like change and stuff that can go in there. Okay, let's just like,
[20569.26s -> 20594.97s]  go I guess. You know the grace that I can go to? Our capital is burning. Okay, here we go.
[20595.61s -> 20621.88s]  We're in the- I knew you'd come. To stand before the Elden Ring. To become held. What a sad state of
[20621.88s -> 20628.50s]  affairs. I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne. I told you he was a fucking
[20628.50s -> 20636.18s]  asshole. Queen Micah's high hopes for us. But we continue to struggle. Unto eternity. To get Ian
[20636.18s -> 20643.99s]  off near the all-knowing. He does- okay, so why did he tell me to do this then? What's your fucking
[20643.99s -> 20666.52s]  problem? Oh, you're a real fucking chump, that's for sure. Unless let me go, let me guess. He's
[20666.52s -> 20688.18s]  got a face to it. Not actually. Shit. Okay, I'm gonna kill this guy right now. I just- I didn't
[20688.18s -> 20696.86s]  know what he did. He's- does he have a rune? You actually died? He actually died, to get Ian.
[20697.42s -> 20711.74s]  Dude, we're going on 10 hours, man. What do you want me to say? It's right here. Okay, let's
[20711.82s -> 20742.66s]  fucking destroy this guy right now. I didn't- so he's a mage. Fuck you, Gideon.
[20774.73s -> 20792.06s]  Oh, that hurt me too. Fuck you. Okay, magical. Magical protection. I'm wearing-
[20793.42s -> 20798.14s]  excuse me. Magic protection. I need to put it on. I don't know what I'm doing. I- I'm just
[20798.14s -> 20801.82s]  giving- I don't know what I'm doing right now. I'm doing fucking Donald Trump. It's like fucking
[20801.82s -> 20822.44s]  nine and a half hours, 1230. I'm gonna play this game, Gideon. I don't- I don't get this.
[20823.40s -> 20826.84s]  Wasn't the whole time, Gideon, like, oh yeah, we have this place for you,
[20826.84s -> 20831.48s]  tarnished and tarnished, come and go, and we're gonna do the Elden Lord stuff. Yeah,
[20831.48s -> 20835.64s]  go get the runes and become El- why is he- no, no, don't be Elden Lord. How dare you.
[20835.64s -> 20841.30s]  What is he talking about? Didn't- wasn't he the one that wanted us to do this?
[20841.86s -> 20846.46s]  Or does he just want to do it himself? I got news for you, Gideon.
[20847.58s -> 20857.69s]  There ain't a chance in hell that you're- actually probably better than I am, yeah.
[20857.69s -> 20865.29s]  I need magic. Magic defense. That doesn't do anything else besides magic. Magic? Oh god.
[20866.09s -> 20869.11s]  So many pieces of armor. I don't- I have no idea which is better.
[20869.83s -> 20887.69s]  Oil Knight? Uh, some of these are probably better up here. All right, you piece of shit.
[20892.63s -> 20897.03s]  And I'm not gonna cast spells at him. I'm just gonna go bash his head in with this will.
[20897.99s -> 20935.72s]  What's up, dude? Runes, who cares? I don't need them. I'm gonna fucking beat him, all right?
[20935.72s -> 20938.52s]  No, I want to see what's- I want to see what's in that door.
[20939.32s -> 20945.59s]  I want to see what's in that door. It's right there. I'm not gonna- I know it's the final boss.
[20945.59s -> 20977.37s]  I'm not- I just want to see what's in the door. Holy shit, that hurt a lot. You idiot.
[20980.46s -> 20987.82s]  And who could forget Sir Gideon Ofnir? We all know him. There he is.
[20988.78s -> 20991.10s]  You drink?
[21015.02s -> 21026.62s]  What's happening to my brain? This dude's wicked high.
[21028.28s -> 21032.20s]  All right, I'm just gonna go in there and I'm gonna go with my fists and I'm gonna fucking
[21032.28s -> 21039.06s]  crush his head. He's actually throwing. I just- I'm fine. You gotta do a comedy one sometimes,
[21039.06s -> 21044.86s]  okay? You gotta do a comedy one sometimes. That was a good strategy and I'm gonna do it again.
[21047.00s -> 21066.26s]  Sorry, everybody. I apologize. I do. I'm gonna stay across the fucking whole room. What is he
[21066.26s -> 21105.11s]  doing? Now, all rise. You're tarnished. You're dead. Die, you old fuck. Ain't nothing in there,
[21105.11s -> 21110.70s]  is there, Gideon? You're out of spell power, aren't you?
[21118.76s -> 21151.18s]  Hey, butters. Hey, beavers. Scepter of the- Oh, you get- He's got awesome armor.
[21152.62s -> 21162.55s]  I love his armor. It's so cool looking. Can I put that on? So what's- I don't understand
[21162.55s -> 21168.25s]  what his problem is. All-knowing helm. Helm set with countless eyes and ears,
[21168.25s -> 21173.45s]  won by Gideon Ofner, the all-knowing. Knowledge begins with the recognition of one's ignorance.
[21174.09s -> 21179.13s]  The realization that the search for knowledge is unending. But when Gideon glimpsed into the
[21179.13s -> 21196.07s]  will of Queen Merika, he shuddered in fear. At the end, that should not be. I love that helmet.
[21196.71s -> 21233.99s]  I have to keep the head on. All-knowing armor. Light. Really light. Wait, in case you didn't
[21233.99s -> 21257.50s]  notice, he had all the boss powers? He did? Okay, I- that- I'm now- I- it's- it's time to go- I'm
[21257.50s -> 21262.22s]  gonna- I'm going in the Erd Tree. I'm probably- I'm gonna lose, right? I don't think I'm gonna
[21262.22s -> 21280.30s]  beat this boss. I'm not prepared for it. Oh, the staff! He did have a staff. I've got an entire
[21280.30s -> 21294.60s]  museum in my backpack. Honest to God, where is it? It is int scaling. Scepter in the form of a hand
[21294.60s -> 21300.28s]  grasping a pearl. Signature weapon of Sir Gideon Ofnir, the all-knowing. Pearl stands for the world,
[21301.24s -> 21307.40s]  the heavens, and an eye. Representing the many forms of knowledge, never fully attainable.
[21307.96s -> 21318.15s]  Even knowing that, the all-knowing's hand grasps for it. Knowledge above all. Raise the scepter to
[21318.15s -> 21323.43s]  manifest the realm of the all-knowing. Enemy magic and holy damage negation will be reduced for all
[21323.43s -> 21346.04s]  within the area, including the caster. How long does it- this is- this is a weapon.
[21347.72s -> 21361.93s]  This is not a staff. This is an actual swinging weapon. It's a mace. Oh, shit, it is.
[21362.65s -> 21367.96s]  That's really cool. I'm gonna have to check that out. I mean, literally with the end of the game,
[21367.96s -> 21377.18s]  whatever. All right, I- it's- we're going on 10 hours- 10 hours. I know. I gotta speed things up
[21377.18s -> 21380.70s]  here. I want to go in this door. I just need to know. I want to see what- I want to see Queen
[21380.70s -> 21392.41s]  Merica. Definitely fucking in there. Definitely in there. Guarantee it. I want to see Queen Merica.
[21392.41s -> 21421.80s]  I need to go up to the urn-free entrance place, which is up here, right? He has returned. The
[21421.80s -> 21426.84s]  Lord has returned at long last. Our very first Lord to brandish the Elden Ring once more.
[21427.64s -> 21456.81s]  Are you talking about me? I didn't think I had to jump. I thought I was just gonna fall on it.
[21466.68s -> 21486.36s]  And Sir Gideon Arthas arrives. He tarnished. He dead. He lives. That intro is so good. It's a
[21486.36s -> 21490.84s]  great intro. It almost feels like it's like a- like a- promoting like a wrestling event.
[21494.42s -> 21502.55s]  Like hype up- hype up all these superstars. How many times have you watched it? Well,
[21502.55s -> 21527.24s]  at least a couple of times. That's it, probably 20 times. Bird Tree Heal. I have any idea what the fuck
[21527.24s -> 21534.57s]  is going on in this game. Vastly heals HP for self and nearby allies. One of the ancient urn-
[21534.57s -> 21539.29s]  bird tree incantations. Heals a vast amount of HP for the caster and nearby allies. Hold to continue
[21539.29s -> 21544.81s]  praying and delay activation. The urn tree once flourished with abundance, yet it was only for a
[21544.81s -> 21558.57s]  fleeting moment. Such is the course of all life. A moment. A fleeting moment. The urn tree like
[21558.57s -> 21575.13s]  actually had power. Deer. All right, I want to know. What the fuck is it? What's in here?
[21575.13s -> 21601.19s]  What is it? Here we go. I'm turning it up. This thing that's getting the shit out of me.
[21602.71s -> 21637.88s]  It's been a long disdow fight. Farnished warrior. Spurned by the grace of gold. Be assured the
[21637.88s -> 21664.79s]  Elden Ring resteth close at hand. Who the fuck is this? I am returned. Wait, is that-
[21667.83s -> 21672.23s]  To be granted audience once more. Godfrey?
[21679.54s -> 21690.41s]  But what is he? How did he- How did he- As Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.
[21696.76s -> 21705.08s]  Godfrey, the first Elden Lord. Where have you been this whole time?
[21706.63s -> 21713.11s]  I was hiding behind that pillar over there for the last 600 game hours. You just didn't see me,
[21713.11s -> 21746.63s]  but I was snooping. I gotta jump. I gotta jump with that shit. I gotta jump. I didn't want to
[21746.63s -> 21792.39s]  take a rune arc. I wanted to- That's not good. Bomb up. Dude, fucking stop kicking the ground,
[21792.39s -> 21841.50s]  you dick. Oh shit. Dude, yikes. Ambo, you gotta help me here, man. Ambo, please. Ambo, please help
[21841.50s -> 21872.84s]  me. Dude, base two. You gotta fight the goddamn- You gotta fight the lion.
[21873.80s -> 21879.19s]  Speak of service, Sirosh.
[21903.46s -> 21931.83s]  I've given thee courtesy enough. They're into a street fighter character.
[21932.87s -> 21947.91s]  I fight just horror alone. Wait, the- Wait, the chief of the Badlands? Wait,
[21947.91s -> 21970.17s]  the chief of the Badlands from the intro? Oh my god, he's actually fucking zangy.
[21976.44s -> 21987.64s]  That ain't gonna work against this. I don't think so. Oh, I don't know about that. I don't know
[21987.64s -> 22004.54s]  about that. Where was this guy the whole game? Wait, Godfrey? I'm Godfrey. I'm God- No, I'm kidding.
[22004.54s -> 22021.21s]  It's me. Horlou. It's me. It's me. I'm Horlou now. Horlou is Godfrey. There's so many names in this
[22021.21s -> 22085.38s]  game. I know it's time to go to bed, but let's round it out at 10 hours. Come on. Oh, it's a
[22085.38s -> 22108.62s]  little early, but I'm fine. Oh, fuck. Too greedy. Let me do it again. I thought he was gonna hit
[22108.62s -> 22126.54s]  phase two. I was really thinking if that was phase two. That wasn't bad. Mambo's getting his ass
[22126.54s -> 22135.29s]  feed. Mambo is making me happy. He's the chieftain of the Badlands when he's just hanging out.
[22136.89s -> 22178.63s]  That doesn't make any sense. Close enough? Don't jump into it. What, are you stupid?
[22207.75s -> 22273.29s]  Oh, shit. That's bad. I'm dead. Kick. What the fuck? The suplexes. Jesus Christ.
[22288.18s -> 22293.38s]  I'm getting so fucked up here, dude. I'm getting so fucked up. I'm getting so fucked up.
[22294.26s -> 22302.44s]  Dude, I'm getting so fucked up here. I don't fucking have any idea what happened here.
[22302.92s -> 22319.99s]  I don't fucking have any idea what's going on. Jesus. No. There's so much going on. Just get away from me.
[22326.52s -> 22348.86s]  Grow. Oh, I'm dead.
[22356.44s -> 22366.41s]  Casting is too slow. Oh, I got the magic resist gear on. Shit. Did somebody say? You're gonna say
[22366.41s -> 22379.30s]  so bad. Oh, come on, man. This fight is fucking cool. You gotta get.
[22380.42s -> 22416.23s]  I don't know. Should I just go full oven mitts? Okay. I'm ready. I am going to wait to summon
[22417.83s -> 22467.19s]  my buddy. Phase two. Oh, shit. He doesn't. As sloppy as fuck, I'm gonna tell you.
[22467.83s -> 22525.59s]  Get the fuck out of here. Let's go. Come on, Gwen. Come on, Gwen. This guy's just fucking being
[22525.59s -> 22615.90s]  the shit out of me. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck you, bro. Bro. I had to do that. Isn't it? Oh, shit.
[22618.02s -> 22625.29s]  Oh, I'm dead. Stop healing in front of him. Dude, he's just fucking so fast.
[22630.31s -> 22632.87s]  Actually, there's probably not a window to summon in phase two. You're right.
[22635.96s -> 22642.94s]  Going like ding, ding, ding, ding. No, you're fucking dead. I got him. I got him. I got him.
[22643.50s -> 22652.78s]  Out of something right before phase two. That's the play is you got to get somebody. You got you.
[22652.78s -> 22660.84s]  He's just so relentless. All right, let's go. This fight's fucking awesome, by the way. This is the
[22660.84s -> 22673.42s]  best fight in the whole game. This is the best fight in the game. I will stand by that. I gotta
[22673.42s -> 22753.21s]  wait a second for this. I should. Yeah, that was dumb. Let's just be balls. No, man. All right.
[22753.21s -> 22775.51s]  Come on. Oh, my God. All right. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. Here we go.
[22776.73s -> 22800.41s]  Oh, get in there, Mambo. Come on. Shit. I thought he was going for Mambo.
[22801.21s -> 22891.26s]  Mambo, please get aggro, please. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Sit down. I almost fucked it up like three
[22891.26s -> 22909.54s]  times. Remembrance of Hora Lou. But, dude, who's Godfrey? The same person. It's the same guy.
[22909.54s -> 22924.39s]  That was the best fight in the game by far. That was by far the coolest fight in the whole game.
[22925.03s -> 22957.11s]  Is it health or is it endurance? But fair. Yeah, that was so fun. God, that was the best fight in
[22957.11s -> 22963.90s]  the game. I wish I could do that again. And the remembrance. I think I'm gonna do endurance,
[22963.90s -> 22971.10s]  right? Like, it's the safe thing to do. I want to read this because... So what, people,
[22971.74s -> 22984.76s]  you change your name? Oh, I'm Godfrey, but I'm also Hora Lou. I don't get it. Where is it?
[22984.76s -> 22999.05s]  This is a paragraph. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was robbed of his grace,
[23000.01s -> 23004.66s]  becoming tarnished, he took with him his kinfolk and left the lands between.
[23005.30s -> 23011.08s]  After the long march of the tarnish came to an end, Godfrey divested himself of kingship,
[23011.72s -> 23026.78s]  becoming a simple warrior once more. Godfrey got exiled and then changed his name. Hurry up
[23026.78s -> 23031.50s]  and end the stream. The Europeans are gonna wake up any second now, Monka S. I look so awful today.
[23032.14s -> 23038.38s]  I'm the sweatiest I've been probably in the last month, at least. This is the sweatiest stream by
[23038.38s -> 23044.70s]  far. All right, lore masters, I need to ask a question. If I go in, if I go in there and see
[23044.70s -> 23064.42s]  what's in there, is the game end? Only if I... Okay, I kind of want to... Let me see what's up with
[23064.42s -> 23074.14s]  Godfrey. I know we're going really late, but let me just see what's in here. Where is that going? Oh,
[23074.14s -> 23093.42s]  yeah. Okay, so are the fingers gonna talk to me now? Dude, what are you doing? What the fuck?
[23096.65s -> 23104.20s]  They just fucked off. They don't care anymore. Okay, I want to see what this remembrance is.
[23115.85s -> 23124.02s]  But if you're dead, how are you doing this? Axe of Godfrey, dex strength, 42 strength. Damn.
[23124.82s -> 23129.58s]  Weapon of Godfrey Elden Lord, it was broken in a battle fought as leader of the tarnished
[23130.14s -> 23134.86s]  during the long march. This weapon is symbolic of Godfrey's vow to conduct himself as a lord,
[23135.42s -> 23138.94s]  later becoming an emblem of the golden lineage. In the days of the past,
[23139.58s -> 23149.61s]  the crown was warranted with strength. Or Oralu's earthshaker. Oralu's earthshaker slammed
[23149.61s -> 23159.06s]  both hands into the ground. Okay, that's awesome. Heavy. This is strength stuff.
[23162.25s -> 23173.46s]  They said they wouldn't talk for thousands of years. Read Godfrey's icon talisman. Do I have
[23173.46s -> 23192.28s]  that? I don't have it. All right, it's time to go in there. I'm not going to use either one of these,
[23192.28s -> 23195.80s]  but I'm not going to break it because in case I don't want to lose the souls. It's time to see
[23195.80s -> 23324.04s]  what the fuck is inside the tree. Finally. Let's do it. What's in here? Title theme.
[23342.71s -> 23397.80s]  Radagon of the Golden Order. Damn. That's a little display on that. Thought I could jump it.
[23404.49s -> 23451.88s]  Oh shit. Okay, I gotta stay behind him. Don't blast it. Shit. Not bad. It's not bad. Oh fuck.
[23452.60s -> 23472.86s]  Oh my goodness. Okay, you gotta run. I just want to see phase two. I want to see phase two and I'm
[23472.86s -> 23491.96s]  done. Radagon. I just want to see phase two because this is not the fight. Mom said it's my turn to
[23491.96s -> 23541.61s]  be Elden Lord. So what? I don't get it. How do you get away? I think you have to dodge through it.
[23552.84s -> 23610.41s]  Dude. What the fuck? I just want to see fucking phase two. Oh my God. I just want to see you
[23610.41s -> 23635.78s]  turn into another fucking monster or something. I got to get that down if I'm going to see phase
[23635.78s -> 23661.37s]  two. Dude, I don't know where the fuck to go. Why is it on phase? Oh, oh, I get it.
[23678.79s -> 23707.19s]  Show me phase two. I got it. I don't know. Phase two. I got it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get
[23707.19s -> 23720.25s]  it. I'll get it. This is fun. You've got to earn phase two. It's so late. I know. I'm so sorry.
[23720.25s -> 23764.95s]  This is so bad. But I gotta go for it. Oh, you do it twice? What's this whole shit?
[23765.67s -> 23771.54s]  That was a bad fucking combo. That was dog shit and you all know it.
[23773.29s -> 23784.20s]  This is dog shit and you all know it. I've never seen him do that fucking move. What is he doing
[23784.20s -> 23834.33s]  that? Oh, come the fuck on. Dude, stop doing that. He's done that move like 50 times this time.
[23835.05s -> 23865.64s]  Do something else. My God, you're going to drive me fucking crazy. Jesus, I dropped my head back.
[23869.13s -> 23874.09s]  He just kept throwing those stupid fucking spears. He did it like 10 fucking times.
[23874.65s -> 23877.85s]  Stop doing that move. Do something else. You have like 40 moves.
[23880.90s -> 23888.06s]  I just want to see phase two. You keep getting hit. Yeah, because it's like he goes, huh? Boom,
[23888.06s -> 23893.66s]  then they explode. And sometimes he does two. Sometimes he does two. This game is a three out
[23893.66s -> 23912.95s]  of 10. It's a three. Wait, I can summon in here? Oh shit, I can summon. I didn't think it would be
[23912.95s -> 23920.42s]  allowed in here. Fighting the fucking Elden Lord. I don't remember your name in the intro,
[23920.42s -> 23938.17s]  dickhead. Dude, show me phase fucking two already so I can go to bed. I just want to see what it is.
[23941.27s -> 23954.74s]  Mambo, help me. Oh no, you got flabbered. That was so sad.
[23958.41s -> 23978.02s]  You didn't, Mambo. What the fuck is that? Get it, Mambo. Oh, Mambo's way outmatched here,
[23978.02s -> 24018.25s]  I think. I just got glassed. Doing it again. What? Show me phase two. Let's see it. Phase two
[24018.25s -> 24030.87s]  incoming. Mambo, just touch him, please. Get it. Mambo, settle down. Save your strength. You're
[24030.87s -> 24124.84s]  going to need it. Dude, what are the fingers? I don't get it. What is that? Elden beast. Mambo,
[24124.84s -> 24151.59s]  hold on. Yeah, we can't even get over there, Mambo. That was a good run. Oh, she just
[24151.59s -> 24183.06s]  liquid-fired him. Mambo just got liquid-fired. Oh my god. Okay, you guys are screwed up.
[24183.06s -> 24220.10s]  What are these? What is this? I don't get it. They're just fingers? Talk to people?
[24220.82s -> 24227.37s]  All right, do I have to do phase two again? Do I have to do phase one again?
[24240.87s -> 24243.51s]  They really want to fuck you up here, huh?
[24247.48s -> 24250.60s]  Yeah, they're really looking to fuck you the whole shit up, huh?
[24254.34s -> 24257.38s]  All right, well, that's cool. I am definitely not doing this tonight.
[24258.34s -> 24273.24s]  We'll come back to this. I'm just doing... I just spit everywhere. I'm not even playing. Look,
[24273.24s -> 24278.92s]  I'm not even playing. I'm just sitting around. It's not even going to be playing today. See,
[24279.00s -> 24282.92s]  he just hit me so bad. I'm dead. I'm going to die right here. He hit me so hard.
[24283.96s -> 24291.82s]  I'm not even playing. See, look, I fucking got hit by a regular attack. Are you kidding me?
[24292.38s -> 24310.09s]  What a shitty player, right? I don't even have any mana. I'm not even trying. I'm not even playing.
[24310.09s -> 24368.10s]  Oh my god. How do you get away from that? You got to be shitting me. Am I seriously too far away?
[24368.74s -> 24400.44s]  I'm not even playing. Just checking it out. You're making pick his own bedtime.
[24401.40s -> 24415.24s]  Okay, Elden Beast. I'm going to get in close. Stay right behind you. I don't know. Stay in
[24415.24s -> 24441.27s]  underneath. You don't want me to sit. Oh my god. You're so fucking far away. Can I get on the horse?
[24451.35s -> 24478.42s]  What do I fucking do here? This is not where you're supposed to be. All right, good night.
[24478.42s -> 24510.15s]  I'll see you later. I don't have any heals left. Whose hand is that? I don't get it. It's aliens.
[24511.58s -> 24514.46s]  All right, I'm done. That's enough. That's enough. Okay, that's enough.
[24516.36s -> 24534.39s]  Well, there's the Elden Beast. Okay, this guy told me. Where was he? Is he still around?
[24552.12s -> 24560.34s]  Three fingers. What the fuck are the fingers? The two fingers. The three fingers. The Elden Beast.
[24561.14s -> 24576.78s]  I don't understand. I can't believe that dude. That two fingers abandoned us and we're in the
[24576.78s -> 24590.62s]  tree and this motherfucker doesn't care. I'll be back in 10,000 years. Horse shit. Where you at?
[24592.14s -> 24629.70s]  Honestly, still just hanging out there. Well, okay. Pretty cool. I'm going to bed. Have a
[24629.70s -> 24636.18s]  wonderful evening and wonderful sleep everybody. Sorry we went so long. That was a lot going on
[24636.18s -> 24641.99s]  today. We did bro versus bro with Ludwig. We're out of the end of Elden Ring. I didn't beat it,
[24641.99s -> 24653.50s]  but here we are. Damn. Very cool. I have a lot more questions though. The next stream,
[24655.54s -> 24665.94s]  I will see you guys on Sunday. We'll go Sunday. So nothing today technically and then nothing on
[24665.94s -> 24681.30s]  Saturday. I'm going to try to beat Elden Ring on Sunday. Hopefully. Check the Godfrey armor.
[24681.86s -> 24716.90s]  Uh, didn't I get so many armors? Where is it? Oh, it's at the finger lady. Right. Okay.
[24717.94s -> 24735.35s]  Elden Lord Crown. The age of the urtree began amongst conflict when Godfrey was Lord of the
[24735.35s -> 24741.27s]  battlefield. He led the war against the giants, faced the Storm Lord alone. And then there came
[24741.27s -> 24747.03s]  a moment when his last worthy enemy fell. And it was then as the story was told that the hue of
[24747.03s -> 24767.74s]  Lord Godfrey's eyes faded. I didn't register any of that. No, I didn't. Godfrey fought
[24768.54s -> 24785.78s]  Acid Disax, the dragon, and four or five extra sweet sours in his bag. I was like really happy
[24785.78s -> 24797.37s]  about it because you get to save them. You're only going to use one. I don't. Okay. There's a lot.
[24797.37s -> 24805.51s]  I'm going to watch the baddie video. Wasn't that dragon was an Elden Lord? What the fuck is an
[24805.51s -> 24810.71s]  Elden Lord? I keep hearing these terms and I don't know really what any of them actually mean.
[24811.43s -> 24825.35s]  Oh, tarnished. Two fingers. Elden Lord. Elden Lord. So, a dragon was Elden Lord, which means that
[24825.35s -> 24834.65s]  the greater will, right? Like, yeah, that's fine. The dragon's an Elden Lord. This guy killed the
[24834.73s -> 24840.34s]  dragon and like became Elden Lord and they were like, oh shit. Um, okay.
[24845.03s -> 24860.50s]  Tarnished are people who lost grace. But what is grace? What does that mean? Elden Lord is like a
[24860.50s -> 24883.16s]  God's chosen person. Grace is the guidance of God. It's the guidance of the greater will. Okay. So,
[24883.16s -> 24895.85s]  why did I burn the urn tree? What are we doing in here? Just because you wanted to get inside.
[24896.81s -> 24916.22s]  Get the Elden Ring, you idiot. Because the world sucks. Okay. I guess that makes sense.
[24916.86s -> 24927.42s]  I'm very interested in the lore. I really am. So, is the greater will and the urn tree the same
[24927.42s -> 24940.34s]  entity? What the fuck is the urn tree? Why is the urn tree even here? Who planted that shit?
[24941.51s -> 24947.67s]  Who planted the urn tree? What is the howling tree? Why is there a howling tree?
[24947.67s -> 24951.88s]  Why is there so many- why do those people have trumpets? Why is there so many trumpets?
[24960.33s -> 24963.93s]  All right. All right. I'll see you guys. I'll see you later. I'll see you on Sunday.
[24969.61s -> 24979.24s]  Why do they have trumpets, baddie? Please tell us. Very interesting. That's cool though. So,
[24979.24s -> 24990.12s]  Horoloo is Godfrey. Godfrey. We fought Godfrey's yellow shade in the- why was he not here? Remember
[24990.12s -> 24995.70s]  it was like he was bright and gold and we fought him in that- before the throne room and then he
[24995.70s -> 25005.70s]  shows up again later. Oh, hey, it's me, Godfrey. Was that him fighting us? Was it somebody pretending
[25005.70s -> 25027.54s]  to be him? It was a force ghost. It's cool. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. All right. Just
[25027.54s -> 25038.49s]  go with it. I am. I'm just very curious. And what's- what is- with Gideon so badly was like,
[25038.49s -> 25044.01s]  oh, you are gonna stand- wasn't he like, oh, we both- well, you're gonna stand before the Elden
[25044.01s -> 25049.05s]  Lord. Oh, that's what we tarnish do. That's what we do. Don't go stand in front of the Elden Lord,
[25049.05s -> 25069.98s]  you dick. All right. Watch the lore video. I think there's still more to know because this is-
[25069.98s -> 25074.54s]  obviously this is an end of the game, which is going to be something, right? All right. I'll see
[25074.54s -> 25077.82s]  you guys later. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. Staying up late. That was a meaty one.
[25079.18s -> 25083.26s]  This is the longest stream I've done in a long time. I think the first, second or third Elden
[25083.26s -> 25089.56s]  Ring stream was pretty long. I'm gonna give this game a three. We'll bump it up a little bit. It's
[25089.56s -> 25107.29s]  like a 9.7 maybe. That's cool. What a cool game. I'm- is it weird that I'm sad? I'm kind of sad.
[25109.19s -> 25119.38s]  It's not over yet, but it is- it will be really soon. It's sad. We'll get another stream out of
[25119.38s -> 25134.31s]  it. I still have to rage quit Milani again. I've got to kill the glass boss. Pretty much it.
[25139.98s -> 25142.70s]  Ending of playing your first playthrough of a masterpiece is always sad.
[25144.14s -> 25152.23s]  Yeah, I kind of look at the map. I'll go to bed in a second. It's just like- this was a journey.
[25152.23s -> 25155.91s]  This was absolutely a journey. I have no idea what the hell's really going on, but
[25156.95s -> 25174.74s]  it sure was fun walking around through the sewers as well. Three fingers. I did fight Mog.
[25175.54s -> 25187.10s]  Yep. I killed- yep. I killed Rikard. I killed Mog. Very cool. No, this is- it's fantastic. It is.
[25189.69s -> 25196.65s]  Well, think about this, right? I will leave you with this. I have been playing this game a lot.
[25198.89s -> 25208.02s]  We have officially passed more than a month of playing this game every single time I turn the
[25208.02s -> 25216.38s]  stream on. A month. I can't remember the last- even other From Software games. I can't remember the
[25216.38s -> 25229.16s]  last time that a game has kept my attention for more than 100 hours. I don't think so. Nothing
[25229.16s -> 25236.73s]  has kept my attention for this long. But Elden Ring streams are not going to stop because I'm
[25236.73s -> 25245.03s]  going to try to beat the game. Let's hope I do it. I will eventually, right? I want to do an invasion
[25245.03s -> 25252.44s]  like PvP summon night. I think that'd be fun. Do some like- have like a community password
[25252.44s -> 25260.87s]  and just fuck around. Also might need to do the Me Strong stream. Yeah, I'm not done with it. I-
[25260.87s -> 25277.13s]  the game is too good to leave it completely. Oh, it's April Fools. I got nothing for you. I'm
[25277.13s -> 25294.52s]  too tired to have anything for you. Gotta do something weird. Here's the joke. Happy April
[25294.52s -> 25303.45s]  Fools, everybody. Beating the game tonight. I'm- I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's a joke.
[25304.01s -> 25324.86s]  Look at my eyes. God, I look like- my face looks- I look weird. You beady eyes.
[25325.74s -> 25334.95s]  Stop. Do a tier list. Legit do it. I'm not- I can't. That was a joke. I'll see you later.
[25335.75s -> 25347.35s]  99 hours? I'm gonna go over 100. Come on. All right, good night. Thanks for watching, as always.
[25347.35s -> 25355.80s]  I'll see you guys later. See you on Sunday. Somewhere around four o'clock Pacific. We will
[25355.88s -> 25362.42s]  try to beat this game. Here's some of the other stuff that is in the game. And depending on how
[25362.42s -> 25370.25s]  long that takes, we will potentially go into some PvP stuff. Maybe I'll do some summoning stuff. If
[25370.25s -> 25375.93s]  you guys want to summon me to your game. You want to summon me, German985, to come and visit
[25375.93s -> 25384.36s]  your game. That's right. One of you lucky few will get German985 to come and enter your game.
[25389.40s -> 25402.07s]  Help me fight Milani- okay. Maybe we should just Mario Party Milania. It doesn't matter.
[25410.57s -> 25416.44s]  We Mario Partied the Dragon in Dark Souls 3, and I don't think we even beat it. I think I had three
[25416.44s -> 25435.85s]  or four of you guys come in, and we still couldn't do it. Do a hamburger helper tier list. I will be
[25435.85s -> 25447.50s]  very upset if you do that. That fight sucks. It's so bad. It's just too much. I definitely- okay,
[25447.50s -> 25457.06s]  before trying to do Milania, like really grind out the hours to eat Milania, I'm gonna have a
[25457.06s -> 25464.68s]  full breakfast. I'm gonna have to take some vitamins. I'm gonna need a full like eight hours
[25464.68s -> 25476.98s]  of sleep. I need to be ready. Do a From Software boss tier list. That actually sounds like fun,
[25476.98s -> 25483.78s]  although I don't really remember all that much of some of the other games. I would need some
[25483.78s -> 25500.66s]  refreshing, but that'd be fun. Well, thanks for taking the journey, as always. Have a good night,
[25501.30s -> 25561.67s]  and call your mother. See you guys soon. Not right now. Good night.
